 Direct contribution 
 
 Argentine exchange regulations 
 Since the second half of 2019, the Argentine government instituted exchange controls restricting the ability of companies and individuals to exchange Argentine Pesos for foreign currencies and their ability to remit foreign currency out of Argentina. An entity s authorization request to the Central Bank of Argentina CBA to access the official exchange market to make foreign currency payments may be denied depending on the circumstances. As a result of these exchange controls, markets in Argentina developed trading mechanisms, in which an entity or individual buys U.S. dollar denominated securities in Argentina (i.e. shares, sovereign debt) using Argentine Pesos, and subsequently sells the securities for U.S. dollars, in Argentina, to access U.S. dollars locally, or outside Argentina, by transferring the securities abroad, prior to being sold (the latter commonly known as Blue Chip Swap Rate ). The Blue Chip Swap Rate has diverged significantly from Argentina s official exchange rate (commonly known as the exchange spread). In recent years, the Blue Chip Swap Rate has been higher than Argentina s official exchange rate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the exchange spread was and , respectively. 
 As part of the exchange controls, since 2019, the Argentine government imposes a tax on the acquisition of foreign currency through the official exchange market in certain circumstances. On July 24, 2023, through the Executive Power Decree No. 377/2023, the Argentine government extended the application of this tax to the following cases: (i) certain services acquired from abroad or services rendered by foreign residents in Argentina (i.e. technical, legal, accounting, management, advertising, engineering, audiovisual services, among others), which will be subject to a 25 tax rate, (ii) freight and other transportation services for import and export of goods, which will be subject to a 7.5 tax rate; and (iii) imported goods, which will be subject to a 7.5 tax rate, with certain exemptions (such as fuels and products of the basic food basket). Later, the Decree No. 29/2023, modified the tax rate for the cases mentioned above under ii) and iii) from 7.5 to 17.5 . On September 2, 2024, the Decree No. 777/2024 reestablished the tax rate for cases ii) and iii) mentioned above from 17.5 to 7.5 . 
 to and to , respectively, mainly as a result of (i) no foreign exchange losses recognition during the period related to the acquisition of our own common stock in the Argentine market, which was considered as a non-deductible expense, (ii) lower taxable foreign exchange gains accounted for in Argentina for local tax purposes that are not recorded for accounting purposes since, under U.S. GAAP, the Argentine operations functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to the highly inflationary status of the country, and (iii) higher deductions related to tax inflation adjustments in Argentina. This decrease was partially offset by the reversal of the valuation allowances in one of our Mexican subsidiaries accounted for in the third quarter of 2023. 
 A valuation allowance is recorded when, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the Company s deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with ASC 740, Management periodically assesses the need to either establish or reverse a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets considering positive and negative objective evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. In its assessment, Management considers, among other factors, the nature, frequency and magnitude of current and cumulative losses on an individual subsidiary basis, projections of future taxable income, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, as well as feasible tax planning strategies, which would be employed by the Company to prevent tax loss carryforwards from expiring unutilized. 
 Knowledge-based economy promotional regime in Argentina 
 In August 2021, the Under Secretariat of Knowledge Economy issued the Disposition 316/2021 approving MercadoLibre S.R.L. s application for eligibility under the knowledge-based economy promotional regime, established by the Law No. 27,506 and complemented by Argentina s Executive Power Decree No. 1034/2020, Argentina s Ministry of Productive Development s Resolution No. 4/2021 and the Under Secretariat of Knowledge Economy s Disposition No. 11/2021. On September 13, 2024, Argentina s Secretariat of Entrepreneurs and Small and Medium Enterprises and Knowledge-Based Economy issued Resolution 267/2024, reducing the aggregate cap on base salaries used to calculate the tax credit bond to which companies that qualify for the regime are entitled from 40 million Argentine pesos to 5 million Argentine pesos; the tax credit bond represents of the Company s social security contributions for those employees whose jobs are related to the promoted activities, with a salary cap which has been reduced to the indicated limit. MercadoLibre S.R.L uses the tax credit bond to offset federal taxes.

The risk model uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchant s and consumer s ability to repay the credit, including external and internal indicators. Internal indicators consider user behavior related to credit/payment history, and with lower weight in the risk models, the Company uses the number of transactions in the Company s ecosystem and the merchant s annual sales volume, among other indicators. In addition, the Company considers external bureau information to enhance the model and the decision making process.

 The Company acquired shares of its own common stock in the Argentine market and paid for them in Argentine Pesos at a price that reflects the additional cost of accessing U.S. dollars through securities denominated in U.S. dollars, because of restrictions imposed by the Argentine government for buying U.S. dollars at the official ex change rate in Argentina (see Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies - Argentine currency status and macroeconomic outlook of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements). As a result, the Company recognized foreign currency losses of million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, while foreign currency losses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 amounted to million. The share repurchase program expired on March 31, 2024.

 Business Overview 
 We are the largest online commerce ecosystem in Latin America based on unique visitors and we are present in 18 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay and El Salvador. Our platform is designed to provide users with a complete portfolio of services to facilitate commercial transactions both digitally and offline. 
 44 | MercadoLibre, Inc. 

Table of Contents 

 Through our e-commerce platform, we provide buyers and sellers with a robust and safe environment that fosters the development of a large e-commerce community in Latin America, a region with a population of over 650 million people and with one of the fastest-growing Internet penetration and e-commerce growth rates in the world. We believe that we offer world-class technological and commercial solutions that address the distinctive cultural and geographic challenges of operating a digital commerce platform in Latin America. 
 We offer our users an ecosystem of six integrated e-commerce services and digital financial services: the Mercado Libre Marketplace, the Mercado Pago Fintech platform, the Mercado Envios logistics service, the Mercado Ads solution, the Mercado Libre Classifieds service and the Mercado Shops online storefronts solution. 
 The Mercado Libre Marketplace, is a fully-automated, topically-arranged and user-friendly online commerce platform, which can be accessed through our website and mobile app. This platform enables us (when we act as sellers in our first party sales), merchants and individuals to list merchandise and conduct sales and purchases digitally. The Marketplace has an ample assortment of products, with a wide range of categories such as consumer electronics, apparel and beauty, home goods, automotive accessories, toys, books and entertainment and consumer packaged goods. 
 To complement the Mercado Libre Marketplace and enhance the user experience for our buyers and sellers, we developed Mercado Pago, an integrated digital payments solution. Mercado Pago was initially designed to facilitate transactions on Mercado Libre s Marketplaces by providing a mechanism that allowed our users to securely, easily and promptly send and receive payments. Now, Mercado Pago is a full ecosystem of financial technology solutions both in the digital and physical world. Our digital payments solution enables any MercadoLibre registered user to securely and easily send and receive digital payments and to pay for purchases made on any of Mercado Libre s Marketplaces. Currently, Mercado Pago processes and settles all transactions on our Marketplaces in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, Peru and Ecuador. 
 Beyond facilitating Marketplace transactions, over the years we have expanded our array of Mercado Pago services to third parties outside Mercado Libre s Marketplace. We began first by satisfying the growing demand for online-based payment solutions by providing merchants the necessary digital payment infrastructure for e-commerce to flourish in Latin America. Today, Mercado Pago s digital payments business not only allows merchants to facilitate checkout and payment processes on their websites through a branded or white label solution or software development kits, but it also enables users to transfer money in a simple manner to each other through the Mercado Pago website or on the Mercado Pago app. Through Mercado Pago, we brought trust to the merchant customer relationship, allowing online consumers to shop easily and safely, while giving them the confidence to share sensitive personal and financial data with us. Finally, we have also deepened our fintech offerings by growing our online-to-offline O2O products and services. 
 The Mercado Envios logistics solution enables sellers on our platform to utilize third-party carriers and other logistics service providers, while also providing them with fulfillment and warehousing services. The logistics services we offer are an integral part of our value proposition, as they reduce friction between buyers and sellers, and allow us to have greater control over the full experience. Sellers that opt into our logistics solutions are not only able to offer a uniform and seamlessly integrated shipping experience to their buyers at competitive prices, but are also eligible to access shipping subsidies to offer free or discounted shipping for many of their sales on our Marketplaces. In 2020, we launched Meli Air with a fleet of dedicated aircraft covering routes across Brazil and Mexico, with the aim of improving our delivery times. We have also developed a network of independent neighborhood stores and commercial points (known as Meli Places to receive and store packages that are in transit using our integrated technology. Meli Places network allows buyers and sellers to pick-up, drop-off, or return packages with a better experience, reducing the travel distance for all parties. As of September 30, 2024, we offer our shipping solution directed towards deliveries in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, Peru and Ecuador and we also offer free shipping to buyers in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay and Peru. 
 Mercado Credito, our credit solution available in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Chile, leverages our user base, which is loyal and engaged, and in part has also been historically underserved or overlooked by financial institutions and suffers from a lack of access to needed credit. Facilitating credit is a key service overlay that enables us to further strengthen the engagement and lock-in rate of our users, while also generating additional touchpoints and incentives to use Mercado Pago as an end-to-end financial solution. 
 Our asset management product, which is available in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Chile, is a critical pillar to build our alternative two-sided network vision. It incentivizes our users to begin to fund their digital wallets with cash as opposed to credit or debit cards given that the return our product offers is greater than traditional checking accounts. 
 As an extension of our asset management and savings solutions for users, we launched a digital assets feature as part of the Mercado Pago wallet in Brazil, Mexico and Chile, in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. This service allows our millions of users to purchase, hold and sell selected digital assets through our interface without leaving the Mercado Pago application, while a partner acts as the custodian and exchange and offers the blockchain infrastructure platform. This feature is available for all users through their Mercado Pago wallet. 
 Our advertising platform, Mercado Ads, enables businesses to promote their products and services on the Mercado Libre Marketplace and Mercado Pago Fintech platform. Through our advertising platform, MercadoLibre s brands and sellers are able to display ads on our webpages through product searches, banner ads, or suggested products. Our advertising platform enables merchants and brands to access the millions of consumers that are on our Marketplaces at any given time with the intent to purchase, which increases the likelihood of conversion. Advertisers are able to leverage our first-party data to create and target highly particularized audiences. 
 Through Mercado Libre Classifieds, our online classified listing service, our users can also list and purchase motor vehicles, real estate and services in the countries where we operate. Classifieds listings differ from Marketplace listings as they only charge optional placement fees and not final value fees. Our classifieds pages are also a major source of traffic to our platform, benefiting both the commerce and fintech businesses.

 Complementing the services we offer, our digital storefront solution, Mercado Shops, allows users to set-up, manage and promote their own digital stores. These stores are hosted by Mercado Libre and offer integration with the rest of our ecosystem, namely our Marketplaces, payment services and logistics services. Users can create a store at no cost, and can access additional functionalities and value added services on commission. 
 
 Reporting Segments and Geographic Information 
 Our segment reporting is based on geography, which is the criterion our Management currently uses to evaluate our segment performance. Our geographic segments are Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Other Countries (including Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay). Although we discuss long-term trends in our business, it is our policy not to provide earnings guidance in the traditional sense. We believe that uncertain conditions make the forecasting of near-term results difficult. Further, we seek to make decisions focused primarily on the long-term welfare of our Company and believe focusing on short-term earnings does not best serve the interests of our stockholders. We believe that execution of key strategic initiatives as well as our expectations for long-term growth in our markets will best create stockholder value. A long-term focus may make it more difficult for industry analysts and the market to evaluate the value of our Company, which could reduce the value of our common stock or permit competitors with short-term tactics to grow more rapidly than us. We, therefore, encourage potential investors to consider this strategy before making an investment in our common stock. 
 The following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues by segment for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 (2) For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the main driver of Argentina s net revenues and financial income decrease is partially explained by the average inter-annual increase of Argentina s official exchange rate against U.S. dollar of 273.8 partially offset by an average inter-annual inflation rate in our Argentine segment of 262.8 . However, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the average inter-annual inflation rate in our Argentine segment of 236.4 , was higher than the average inter-annual increase of Argentina s official exchange rate against U.S. dollar of 204.7 . 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 Results of operations for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2023 
 The selected financial data for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 discussed herein is derived from our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report. The results of operations for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024 or for any other period. 

Principal trends in results of operations 
 
 Net revenues and financial income 
 We disaggregate revenues into four geographical reporting segments. Within each of our segments, the services we provide and the products we sell generally fall into two distinct revenue streams: Commerce and Fintech . 
 Revenues from Commerce transactions are mainly generated from: 
 marketplace fees that include final value fees and flat fees. Final value fees represent a percentage of the sale value that is charged to the seller once an item is successfully sold and flat fees represent a fixed charge for certain transactions below a certain merchandise value; 
 first party sales, which are generated when control of the good is transferred, upon delivery to our customers; 
 shipping fees, which are generated when a buyer elects to receive an item through our shipping service, net of the third-party carrier costs (when we act as an agent). When the Company acts as principal, revenues derived from shipping services are recognized upon delivery of the good to the customer, and presented on a gross basis. In addition, the Company generates storage fees, which are charged to the seller for the utilization of the Company s fulfillment facilities; 
 ad sales fees due to advertising services provided to sellers, vendors, brands and others, through performance products (product ads and brand ads) and display formats, which are recognized based on the number of clicks and impressions, respectively; 
 classifieds fees due to offerings in vehicles, real estate and services, which are charged to sellers who opt to give their listings greater exposure throughout our websites; and 
 fees from other ancillary businesses. 
 Fintech revenues and financial income correspond to our Mercado Pago service, which are attributable to: 
 commissions representing a percentage of the payment volume processed that are charged to sellers in connection with off Marketplace-platform transactions; 
 commissions from additional fees we charge when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our Mercado Pago platform, for transactions that occur either on or off our Marketplace platform; 
 interest, cash advances and fees from credit cards, merchant and consumer loans granted under our Mercado Credito solution; 
 revenues from our asset management product; 
 interest earned on investments as part of Mercado Pago activities, including those required due to fintech regulations, net of interest gains passed through to our Brazilian users in connection with our asset management product; 
 commissions that we charge from transactions carried out with Mercado Pago credit and debit cards; 
 revenues from the sale of mobile points of sale products; 
 revenues from insurtech fees; and 
 commissions from additional fees we charge when our sellers elect to withdraw cash. 
 Although we also process payments on the Marketplace, we do not charge sellers an added commission for this service, as it is already included in the Marketplace final value fee that we charge. 
 We have a highly fragmented customer revenue base given the large numbers of sellers and buyers who use our platforms. For the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no single customer accounted for more than 5.0 of our net revenues and financial income.

 Our Mercado Libre Marketplace is available in 18 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Uruguay, Bolivia, Guatemala, Venezuela (deconsolidated since December 1, 2017) and Paraguay), and Mercado Pago is available in 8 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Uruguay and Ecuador). Additionally, Mercado Envios is available in 8 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Uruguay and Ecuador). The functional currency for each country s operations is the country s local currency, except for Argentina, where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to Argentina s status as a highly inflationary economy. Our net revenues are generated in multiple foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the average monthly exchange rate. Please refer to Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on foreign currency translation. 
 Our net revenues and financial income grew during the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, boosted by an increase in the share of shipping services where we act as principal, as opposed to agent, the growth of credits business originations and our total payment volume. 
 The continued execution of our long-term strategies in Commerce and Fintech businesses has enabled us to deliver growth in gross merchandise volume, total payment volume and net revenues alongside cash generation.

 Gross profit margins 
 Our gross profit margin is defined as total net revenues and financial income minus total cost of net revenues and financial expenses, as a percentage of net revenues and financial income. 
 Our cost structure is directly affected by the level of operations of our services, and our strategic plan on gross profit is built on factors such as an ample liquidity to fund expenses and investments and a cost-effective capital structure. 
 For the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our gross profit margins were 46.4 and 45.9 , and 51.8 and 53.3 , respectively. 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, the decrease in our gross profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in our shipping operating and carrier costs, as a percentage of net revenues and financial income mainly due to an increase in the share of shipping services where we act as principal, as opposed to agent, partially offset by a decrease of our other fintech costs, sales taxes and collection fees, as a percentage of net revenues and financial income.

 In the future, our gross profit margin could continue declining if we maintain the growth of our sales of goods business, which has a lower pure product margin, building up our logistics network and if we fail to maintain an appropriate relationship between our cost of revenue structure and our net revenues and financial income trend.

Our tax obligations consist of current and deferred income taxes incurred in these jurisdictions. We account for income taxes following the liability method of accounting. A valuation allowance is recorded when, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, our income tax expense consists of taxes currently payable, if any (given that in certain jurisdictions we still have net operating loss carry-forwards), plus the change in our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the estimate tax rate, adjusted for discrete items that are accounted for in the relevant period. 
 The following table summarizes the composition of our income taxes for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 During the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, income tax expense decreased mainly as a result of lower income tax expense in Argentina and Brazil due to lower taxable income in Argentina and higher deferred tax assets in our Brazilian segment. This decrease was partially offset by higher income tax expense in Mexico in 2024 mainly driven by the income tax gains recognized in Mexico during the third quarter of 2023 as a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance in one of our Mexican subsidiaries and higher income tax expense due to withholding tax on dividends. 
 
 The following table summarizes our estimated effective tax rates for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 (1) Percentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than the rounded amounts that appear in the table. 
 
 Our estimated effective tax rate for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 decreased as compared to the same periods in 2023, mainly as a result of (i) no foreign exchange losses recognition during the period related to the acquisition of our own common stock in the Argentine market, which was considered as a non-deductible expense, (ii) lower taxable foreign exchange gains accounted for in Argentina for local tax purposes that are not recorded for accounting purposes since, under U.S. GAAP, the Argentine operations functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to the highly inflationary status of the country, and (iii) higher deductions related to tax inflation adjustments in Argentina. This decrease was partially offset by the reversal of the valuation allowances in one of our Mexican subsidiaries accounted for in the third quarter of 2023.

Capital expenditures 
 Our capital expenditures (comprised of our investments in property and equipment (such as certain assets used in our fulfillment centers) and intangible assets (excluding digital assets)) for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to 555 million and 329 million, respectively. 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we invested 237 million in information and technology assets in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, and 269 million in our Argentine, Brazilian and Mexican shipping premises and offices.

 We are continually increasing our level of investment in hardware and software licenses necessary to improve and update our platform s technology and computer software developed internally. We anticipate continued investments in capital expenditures related to information technology and logistics network capacity in the future as we strive to maintain our position in the Latin American e-commerce and fintech market. 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the sale of credit card receivables, short-term investments and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, property and equipment expenditures and to pay or repay obligations in the foreseeable future. 
 
 Other data 
 The following table includes nine key performance indicators, which are calculated as defined in the footnotes to the table. We continuously assess the adequacy of our key performance indicators based on the growth and ever changing nature of our business. Each of these indicators provides a different measure of the level of activity on our ecosystem, which we use to monitor the performance of the business.

 (2) As of January 1, 2024, we have replaced Unique Active Users with Fintech monthly active users and Unique active buyers as our main indicators of our Fintech and Commerce revenue lines. Management believes that the significant growth of our Fintech business merits a standalone metric to more precisely measure its footprint and user base growth and to make the best strategic decisions for the development of the Fintech business. Fintech monthly active users is defined as Fintech payers and/or collectors as of September 30, 2024, that, during the last month of the reporting period, performed at least one of the following actions during such month: 1) made a debit or credit card payment, 2) made a QR code payment, 3) made an off-platform online payment using our checkout or link of payment solutions while logged in to our Mercado Pago fintech platform, 4) made an investment or employed any of our savings solutions, 5) purchased an insurance policy, 6) took out a loan through our Mercado Credito solution, or 7) received the payment from a sale or transaction either on or off marketplace. 
 (3) As described above, as of January 1, 2024, unique active buyers is the main performance indicator of our Commerce revenue line. Management believes that monitoring the Commerce business growth through a standalone metric enables us to better understand user behavior over each period and make strategic decisions to improve the Commerce business. Unique active buyers is defined as users that have performed at least one purchase on the Mercado Libre Marketplace during the reported period. 
 (4) Total U.S. dollar sum of all transactions completed through the Mercado Libre Marketplace, excluding Classifieds transactions. 
 (5) Number of items that were sold/purchased through the Mercado Libre Marketplace, excluding Classifieds items. 
 (6) Number of items that were shipped through our shipping service. 
 (7) Total U.S. dollar sum of all transactions paid for using Mercado Pago, including marketplace and non-marketplace transactions, excluding peer-to-peer transactions. As of January 1, 2024, we no longer include peer-to-peer transactions in our TPV in accordance with the metrics and underlying criteria used by our Mercado Pago team, which Management then employs to make strategic decisions. Consequently, total payment volume for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2023 , has been recast to exclude peer-to-peer transactions. 
 (8) As of January 1, 2024, we have replaced Total volume of payment on marketplace with Acquiring total payment volume. Total volume of payment on marketplace was limited to the total U.S. dollar sum of all marketplace transactions paid for using Mercado Pago, and thus was a relevant and representative metric when the off-platform payment processor business was managed as a payment processor with a wallet. In light of the significant growth of our Fintech businesses and our payment processing and settling services, Management believes that Acquiring TPV, which also takes into account non-marketplace transactions paid for using Mercado Pago, results in a more representative measure of our physical and online payment processing solutions in any given period. Acquiring TPV is defined as total U.S. dollar sum of all transactions settled using our Mercado Pago and Mercado Pago's payment processing and settling services in marketplace and non-marketplace transactions and consist of the following transactions volume: 1) point of sale payment volume, 2) commerce payment volume through our Mercado Libre Marketplace, 3) online payment volume through our checkout or link payment solution for merchants, and 4) QR code payment volume. 
 (9) Number of all transactions paid for using Mercado Pago, excluding peer-to-peer transactions. As of January 1, 2024 we no longer include peer-to-peer transactions in our total payment transactions in accordance with the metric and understanding criteria used by our Mercado Pago team, which Management then employs to make strategic decisions. Consequently, total payment volume for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2023, has been recast to exclude peer-to-per transactions. 
 (10) Net interest margins after losses NIMAL represents the annualized ratio between the total credits revenues less funding costs and provision for doubtful accounts for the period and total average gross loans receivable for the period. Management uses NIMAL to monitor how effective our pricing is and managing the credit products relative to their risk and setting targets. Accordingly, Management is of the opinion that NIMAL provides useful information to investors and others related to our risk appetite through the different periods and shows how we effectively prices risk.

 Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance 
 To supplement our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present earnings before interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and equity in earnings of unconsolidated entity Adjusted EBITDA ), net debt, foreign exchange FX neutral measures and Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables below. 
 These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. 
 We believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the effect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense and equity in earnings of an unconsolidated entity. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation of leverage ratios. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our Management. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain items. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the period indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) (In millions) Net income 1,272 822 397 359 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 465 389 157 135 Interest income and other financial gains (107) (95) (43) (38) Interest expense and other financial losses 117 136 40 53 Foreign currency losses, net 132 508 40 239 Income tax expense 397 504 123 172 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entity (3) Adjusted EBITDA 2,276 2,261 714 920 

Net debt 
 We define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial liabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities restricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current leverage ratios and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company s balance sheet, cash flows and income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and other market participants in showing the evolution of the Company s indebtedness and its capability of repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used measures.

 FX neutral 
 We believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. 
 The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2023 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2024, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.

 Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments 
 Adjusted free cash flow 
 Adjusted free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less the increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and investments related to customer funds due to regulatory requirements and other restrictions and equity securities held at cost, investments in property and equipment and intangible assets, changes in loans receivable, net and net proceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities related to our Fintech solutions, since we consider those liabilities as the working capital of the Fintech activities. We consider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity generation that provides useful information to management and investors since it shows how much cash the Company generates with its core activities that can be used for discretionary purposes and to repay its corporate and/or commerce debt. A limitation of the utility of adjusted free cash flow as a measure of liquidity generation is that it is a partial representation of the total increase or decrease in our available cash and investments balance for the period. Therefore, we believe it is important to view the adjusted free cash flow measure only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments 
 Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments represents adjusted free cash flow less net proceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities, related to our Commerce and corporate activities, payments of finance lease obligations, other investing and/or financing activities not considered above and the effect of exchange rates changes on available cash and investments. We consider Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments to be a measure of liquidity availability that provides useful information to management and investors after netting out all other debt and corporate payments and activities from the adjusted free cash flow. 
 The following table shows a reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase in available cash and investments:

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risks arising from our business operations. These market risks arise mainly from macroeconomic instability and the possibility that changes in interest rates and the U.S. dollar exchange rate with local currencies, particularly the Brazilian Real, Mexican Peso and Argentine Peso due to Brazil s, Mexico s and Argentina s respective share of our revenues, may affect the value of our financial assets and liabilities. 
 We are also exposed to market risks arising from our long-term retention programs LTRPs ). These market risks arise from our obligations to pay employees cash payments in amounts that vary based on the market price of our stock. 
 Foreign currencies 
 We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian Real, Argentine Peso, Mexican Peso, Colombian Peso and Chilean Peso, subjecting us to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. 
 We use foreign currency exchange forward contracts and currency swaps to protect our foreign currency exposure and our investment in a foreign subsidiary from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow, net investment and fair value hedges for accounting purposes. The derivatives gain or loss for cash flow and net investment hedges is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are subsequently reclassified into the financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The derivatives gain or loss for fair value hedges is reported in our interim condensed consolidated statements of income in the same line items as the change in the value of the hedged item due to the hedged risks. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we hold cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalent, short and long-term investments in local currencies in our subsidiaries, and have receivables denominated in local currencies in all of our operations. Our subsidiaries generate revenues and incur most of their expenses in the respective local currencies of the countries in which they operate. As a result, our subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency except for our Argentine subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to the inflationary environment. As of September 30, 2024, the total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalent denominated in foreign currencies totaled 2,862 million, short-term investments denominated in foreign currencies totaled 3,445 million, long-term investments denominated in foreign currencies totaled 711 million and accounts receivable, credit card receivables and other means of payment and loans receivable in foreign currencies totaled 9,204 million. To manage exchange rate risk, our treasury policy is to transfer most cash and cash equivalents in excess of working capital requirements into U.S. dollar-denominated accounts in the United States and to enter into certain foreign exchange derivatives, such as currency forwards contracts, in order to mitigate our exposure to foreign exchange risk. As of September 30, 2024, our U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled 1,682 million and our U.S. dollar-denominated long-term investments totaled 515 million. 
 For the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2024, we had a consolidated loss on foreign currency of 132 million and 40 million, respectively, mainly related to foreign exchange losses from our Brazilian, Argentine and Mexican subsidiaries. See "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of operations Other income (expenses), net for more information.

 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
 The table below shows the impact on our net revenues, cost of net revenues and financial expenses, operating expenses, other income (expenses) and income tax, net income and equity for a positive and a negative 10 fluctuation on all the foreign currencies to which we are exposed to at the moment of translating our financial statements to U.S. dollars for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024:

 (1) Increase of the subsidiaries local currency against U.S. Dollar. 
 (2) Decrease of the subsidiaries local currency against U.S. Dollar. 
 (3) Includes cost of net revenues and financial expenses and operating expenses. 
 The table above shows an increase in our net income when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies because of the positive impact of the increase in income from operations. On the other hand, the table above shows a decrease in our net income when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies because of the negative impact of the decrease in income from operations. 
 Brazilian segment 
 Considering a hypothetical increase of 10 of the Brazilian Real exchange rate against the U.S. dollar on September 30, 2024, the reported net assets in our Brazilian subsidiaries would have decreased by approximately 249 million with the related impact in Other Comprehensive Income. Additionally, we would have recorded a foreign currency loss amounting to approximately 37 million in our Brazilian subsidiaries. 
 Mexican segment 
 Considering a hypothetical increase of 10 of the Mexican Peso exchange rate against the U.S. dollar on September 30, 2024, the reported net assets in our Mexican subsidiaries would have decreased by approximately 135 million with the related impact in Other Comprehensive Income. Additionally, we would have recorded a foreign currency loss amounting to approximately 8 million in our Mexican subsidiaries. 
 Argentine segment 
 In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have classified our Argentine operations as highly inflationary since July 1, 2018, using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for purposes of reporting our financial statements. Therefore, no translation effect has been accounted for in other comprehensive income related to our Argentine operations since July 1, 2018. Argentina s inflation rate for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 101.6 and 103.2 , respectively. 
 We use Argentina s official exchange rate to account for transactions in our Argentine segment, which as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 970.50 and 808.45 Argentine Pesos, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Argentina s official exchange rate against the U.S. dollar increased 20.0 and 97.5 , respectively. The average exchange rate for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 887.8 and 245.8, respectively, resulting in an increase of 261 . 
 Considering a hypothetical increase of 10 of the Argentine Peso exchange rate against the U.S. dollar on September 30, 2024, the effect on non-functional currency net liability position in our Argentine subsidiaries would have been a foreign exchange gain amounting to approximately 35 million in our Argentine subsidiaries. 
 See Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies - Foreign currency translation - Argentine currency status and Argentine exchange regulations of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on the currency status and the exchange regulations of our Argentine segment.

 Interest 
 Our earnings and cash flows are also affected by changes in interest rates. These changes could have an impact on the interest rates that financial institutions charge us prior to the time we sell our Mercado Pago receivables and on the financial debt that we use to fund Mercado Pago and Mercado Credito s operations. As of September 30, 2024, Mercado Pago s receivables totaled 4,585 million. Interest rate fluctuations could also impact interest earned through our Mercado Credito solution. As of September 30, 2024, loans receivable net of the allowance for doubtful accounts from our Mercado Credito solution totaled 4,404 million. Interest rate fluctuations could also negatively affect certain of our fixed rate and floating rate investments comprised primarily of time deposits, money market funds and sovereign debt securities. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our short-term investments amounted to 4,511 million and our long-term investments amounted to 1,226 million. Our short-term investments can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date. See Note 3 Fintech Regulations and Note 5 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on our restricted investments. 
 Fluctuations of the interest rate could also have a negative impact on interest expense related to our Loans payable and other financial liabilities, as a portion of these instruments is subject to variable interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, our loans payable and other financial liabilities which accrue interest based on variable rates amounted to 3,841 million, while our loans payable and other financial liabilities, which accrue interest based on fixed rates, amounted to 1,512 million. See Note 13 Loans payable and other financial liabilities and Note 14 Securitization transactions of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail. Considering a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the interest rates, the reported interest expense related to Loans payable and other financial liabilities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 would have increased by approximately 18 million with the related impact in cost of net revenues and financial expenses or in interest expense and other financial losses. We have entered into swap contracts to hedge the interest rate fluctuation of 342 million notional amount, 177 million of which have been designated as hedging instruments. See Note 16 Derivative instruments of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on derivative instruments. 
 
 Equity price risk 
 Our Board, upon the recommendation of the compensation committee, approved the 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 Long Term Retention Programs (the 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 LTRPs ), respectively, under which certain eligible employees have the opportunity to receive cash payments annually for a period of six years.
