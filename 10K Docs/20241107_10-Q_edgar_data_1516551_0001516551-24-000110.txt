 In addition, the former preferred stockholders of BRB were entitled to additional merger consideration for each dollar invested in a concurrent private investment in public equity transaction (the "2023 PIPE Financing"). Because the 2023 PIPE Financing and BRB Acquisition occurred contemporaneously and in contemplation of each other, in accounting for the transaction, the Company allocated the shares issued as additional merger consideration between the BRB Acquisition and 2023 PIPE Financing using a residual allocation method, whereby the fair value of the consideration transferred was first allocated to the monetary assets and 2023 PIPE Financing proceeds with the remainder allocated to the in-process research and development (" IPR D") asset, nimacimab. As a result, additional shares of common stock were allocated to the BRB Acquisition.

 Restricted Stock Units 
 On February 29, 2024, the Company granted restricted stock units ("RSUs") to its executive management team and to certain members of the Board with market-based vesting conditions. The RSUs are eligible to vest subject to the achievement and attainment of certain market capitalization target goals and share price targets (market-based vesting conditions).

On August 22, 2024, the Board approved a modification to the terms of the RSUs issued on August 25, 2023, and September 29, 2023 to its executive management team and to a member of the Board. The vesting condition was modified from a performance-based condition to a market-based condition. Since the performance condition under the original award was improbable of being met at the time of the modification, no expense was previously recognized. Therefore, on the modification date, the Company established a new fair value and will recognize the expense over the derived service period. The Company used the Monte Carlo Simulation model to evaluate the derived service period and fair value of the awards. 
 
 The fair value of the Company's market-based RSUs were estimated on the modification date under the following assumptions:

 Stock Compensation Adjustments Related to Board Member Resignations

Concurrently, the Board approved a modification to the option awards granted such Board members, which modification accelerated the vesting of all unvested options as of the resignation date and extended the post-termination exercise period to December 31, 2025. As a result of the modification, the Company recognized in incremental stock compensation expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Skye Bioscience, Inc. vs Partner Re Ireland Insurance 
 In February 2023, the Company brought a suit against the Company's D O insurance carrier, Partner Re Ireland Insurance DAC ("Partner Re"), bringing claims for (a) breach of contract, (2) tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and (3) declaratory relief that Partner Re is obligated to reimburse the Company for the defense fees and costs incurred in defense of the Cunning Lawsuit and must indemnify the Company for any settlement or judgment in the Cunning Lawsuit (the "Partner Re Lawsuit"). The Company's allegations arise out of Partner Re's refusal to reimburse the Company for costs incurred by the Company in defending the Cunning Lawsuit. The case, entitled Skye Bioscience, Inc., v. Partner Re Ireland Insurance DAC , was filed in the United Stated District Court for the Central District of California. 
 On April 17, 2023, Partner Re filed a motion to dismiss the Company's complaint. On June 20, 2023, the court issued a ruling in favor of the Company and denied Partner Re's motion to dismiss the Company's lawsuit. In April 2024, the Company filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. In June of 2024, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court granted the Company's motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to Partner Re's affirmative defense related to whether the Cunning Lawsuit constituted a Securities Claim as defined in the Partner Re policy, rejecting what had been Partner Re's primary basis for denying coverage. 
 The Company is pursuing up to in coverage less the deductible to cover legal expenses incurred and any potential loss incurred from the Cunning Lawsuit. 
 Estimate for accrued legal contingencies and related expenses 
 Following the Ninth Circuit's favorable decision and the Company's mediation efforts with PartnerRe, a change in estimate for legal contingencies was recorded. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has reversed the accrued interest on the original judgment and adjusted its potential loss for accrued legal contingencies and related expenses, which includes legal accruals and all other costs related to its ongoing litigation matters. 
 Management uses significant judgment in developing its estimates related to legal contingencies and loss recoveries. These adjustments are based on the evaluation of case history, mediation efforts, the facts of the cases and take into consideration both future potential judgment amounts, damages and potential attorney fee awards if the cases were to be retried. 
 The final amount of the loss and loss recoveries remain uncertain. The ultimate amount of the potential loss may be significantly less than the amount of the revised legal contingency and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in its efforts to recover additional losses. The Company believes that it is at least reasonably possible that the estimated amount of the potential loss may change in the near term.

 Stock Option Grants 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company granted an aggregate of common stock options to members of management, employees and directors under the Amended and Restated Plan. 
 San Francisco Office Lease 
 On September 25, 2024, the Company entered into a new lease agreement for approximately square feet of office space located at 632 Commercial Street, 5th Floor, San Francisco, California 94111.

 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unlocking new therapeutic pathways for metabolic health through the development of next-generation molecules that modulate G-protein-coupled receptors ("GPCRs"). GPCRs regulate diverse physiological and pathological processes, particularly those that maintain metabolic homeostasis. Therapeutics that target these GPCR-associated pathways may represent novel approaches to address metabolic disorders. 
 Our product candidate, nimacimab, is a peripherally-restricted negative allosteric modulating antibody specific for the human CB1 receptor (CB1), administered as a subcutaneous injectable initially for the treatment of obesity. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we commenced our Phase 2 clinical trial, CBeyond TM , for nimacimab. The CBeyond TM clinical trial includes 120 patients, 18 clinical trial sites and an exploratory combination arm with a GLP-1 agonist to assess differences in weight loss, body composition, and other attributes. The CBeyond TM clinical trial continues to enroll patients and we expect to meet our goal of 50 enrollment by the end of 2024. We expect to provide interim and topline data in the second and fourth quarters of 2025, respectively. 
 This CBeyond TM clinical trial's primary endpoint is to evaluate weight loss using nimacimab compared to placebo. Secondary endpoints include evaluations of safety and tolerability, neuropsychiatric and cognitive evaluation, change in body composition by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA), and changes in key metabolic biomarkers such as triglycerides, and insulin and leptin sensitivity. 
 We believe that nimacimab has competitive advantages that differentiate it within the CB1 inhibitor class. First, as a monoclonal antibody, it is a large molecule that has great difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier and restricts its engagement to CB1 receptors present in tissue/organs within the periphery of the body (i.e., outside the brain). Second, it is a negative allosteric modulator, a unique binding mechanism compared to small-molecule CB1 inhibitors, which may confer advantages in terms of its therapeutic index. Our antibody-based CB1 inhibitor shares many of the characteristics of small molecule inverse agonists by targeting CB1 receptors in adipose tissue to directly increase fat metabolism and indirectly impact hunger hormones. However, we believe its virtually complete restriction to the periphery eliminates problematic central engagement in the brain. In the case of small-molecule CB1 inhibitors, CB1 inhibition in the brain has been associated with dose-dependent neuropsychiatric adverse events. 
 We do not believe that central targeting of CB1 inhibition is required for meaningful efficacy. To demonstrate this, we have developed a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model using humanized mice with knock-in CB1 receptors to interrogate the in vivo efficacy of nimacimab, a humanized IgG4 anti-CB1 antibody. During November 2024, we shared initial data from our DIO study with nimacimab showing dose-dependent weight loss as well as positive changes in body composition and glycemic control upon treatment. Further analysis and repeat studies are underway but we believe that true peripheral CB1 inhibition can positively impact metabolic disorders including obesity. 
 Given the distinct mechanism and beneficial attributes of nimacimab as a peripheral CB1 inhibitor, within the large and heterogeneous obesity landscape we believe there is significant opportunity for nimacimab to potentially complement GLP-1 agonists and other anti-obesity drug mechanisms of action as well as to have a potential role as a monotherapy. 
 22 

In January 2024 and March 2024, we completed two private placement equity transactions (the "January and March PIPE Financings") with institutional accredited investors, in which we raised combined net aggregate proceeds of 83,556,563. The net capital raised from the January and March PIPE Financings along with the reallocation of funds from the elimination of our glaucoma program will allow us to fund our clinical trial for obesity through top-line Phase 2 data and provide us with the ability to expand upon our metabolic program. 
 In April 2024, Skye uplisted to the NASDAQ Global Market stock exchange from the OTCQB. 
 On May 10, 2024, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the ATM Agreement with Piper Sandler Co, as the sales agent (the Sales Agent ), under which we may, from time to time, sell up to 100,000,000 of shares of our common stock through the Sales Agent (the ATM Offering ). We are not obligated to, and we cannot provide any assurances that we will make any sales of the shares under the ATM Agreement. We will pay the Sales Agent a commission for their services in acting as agent in the sale of common stock in an amount up to 3 of the gross sales price per share sold. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not issue any shares under the ATM Offering. 
 In June 2024, we completed our Phase 2a double-masked randomized, placebo-controlled trial of SBI-100 Ophthalmic Emulsion SBI-100 OE in 56 patients with elevated intraocular pressure ("IOP") diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The primary endpoint evaluated the change in diurnal IOP in the treated arm vs. placebo over 2 weeks. The study did not achieve a statistically significant improvement in IOP over placebo. As a result, we eliminated our ocular program and strategically redirected our efforts and capital resources to our metabolic program. We have also terminated our license agreement with the University of Mississippi and other vendor contracts related to the manufacture, development, and sublicense of SBI-100. 
 In August of 2024, the Convertible Note (as defined in Note 5 to the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated 
 Financial Statements). with a principal value of 5,000,000 was converted into 968,973 shares of our common stock. 
 In March of 2023, we appealed the judgment in the Cunning Lawsuit (as defined in Note 9 to the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (the "Ninth Circuit"). On October 22, 2024, the Ninth Circuit issued its decision on the appeal and vacated the judgment and remanded the case back to the District Court for a new trial. By the end of 2024, we expect to exonerate the bond and remove the restriction on our cash balance to extend our cash runway and reallocate the funds to further our clinical pipeline. 
 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 16, 2011, and our headquarters are based in San Diego, CA. We also maintain office space in San Francisco, CA. Since our incorporation, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to building our product portfolio through the acquisition of clinical assets and licensing agreements, carrying out research and development, building infrastructure and raising capital. 
 
 Financial Overview 
 Revenues 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue. We do not expect to receive any revenue from our lead drug candidate, nimacimab, or any future drug candidates that we develop unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize, nimacimab or future drug candidates or generate revenue from collaborative agreements with third parties. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 4,883,337 in research and development expenses primarily related to our Phase 2 clinical trial of nimacimab for obesity, manufacturing and residual costs from our legacy Phase 2a SBI-100 OE clinical trial. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred 1,254,653 in research and development expense primarily related to our efforts in conducting the Phase 1 SBI-100 OE clinical trial. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 10,908,538 in research and development expenses primarily related to our Phase 2 clinical trial of nimacimab for obesity, manufacturing and residual costs from our legacy Phase 2a SBI-100 OE clinical trial. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred 4,227,967 in research and development expense primarily related to our efforts in conducting the Phase 1 SBI-100 OE clinical trial. 
 We expect that our ongoing research and development expenses will consist of costs incurred for the development of our lead drug candidate, nimacimab, or our future drug candidates, including, but not limited to: 
 employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; payments to third party contract research organizations and investigative sites; and 
 payments to third party manufacturing organizations and consultants. 
 
 23 

We expect to incur future research and development expenditures to support our preclinical, nonclinical, and clinical studies. Preclinical and nonclinical activities include early discovery efforts with novel molecules, laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess safety and efficacy. 
 The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming and the successful development of our lead drug candidate, nimacimab, and any future drug candidate is highly uncertain. Our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of nimacimab and any future drug candidates as well as ongoing assessments of the commercial potential of such drug candidates. In addition, we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which drug candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. We expect to incur increased research and development expenses in the future as we continue our efforts towards advancing our lead program for nimacimab. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our general and administrative expenses have fluctuated year-over-year as we have entered into various strategic acquisitions to restructure and reposition our company. Additionally, as a business in the early stages of drug development we are in the process of scaling our operations by hiring additional employees and building the infrastructure necessary to increase efficiencies. These initiatives have resulted in additional costs related to the implementation of certain systems, insurance, facilities, legal, tax and accounting costs. As a public company, we expect to incur additional expenses related to insurance, investor relations activities, legal and other administration and professional services to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA and Nasdaq. Other significant costs are expected to include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, business development costs and fees for consulting services. To incentivize our employees and be competitive to retain strong talent we issued additional equity awards in 2023 and 2024, which have resulted in increased stock-based compensation expense. We also expect that certain general and administrative expenses which are commensurate with headcount, will continue to increase in the future in order to support our expected increase in research and development activities, including increased salaries, technology, facilities and other related costs. 
 Other (Income) Expense 
 Other (income) expense primarily includes a gain from the sale of the AVI building (see Note 2 to the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), interest income and interest expense incurred from the Convertible Note which was converted during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no material changes in our Critical Accounting Estimates from the information provided in the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of "Item 7- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, e xcept, for the addition of our critical accounting estimate related to the estimate for accrued legal contingencies and related expenses and loss recoveries. 
 We follow ASC 450, subtopic 450-20 to report accounting for loss contingencies and recoveries. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to us, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. 
 We assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies and recoveries related to legal proceedings that are pending or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, we evaluate the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. 
 If the assessment of a contingency or loss recovery indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred or a loss recovery is realizable and the amount of the asset or liability can be estimated, then the estimated asset or liability would be recorded in our financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. 
 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 1 to the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements and recently adopted accounting pronouncements. While we expect certain recently adopted accounting pronouncements to impact our estimates in future periods, the impact upon adoption was not significant to our current estimates and operations.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred net losses of 16,820,644 and 33,224,854, respectively. 
 In January 2024 and March 2024, we completed the January and March PIPE Financings (as such terms are defined in Note 6 to the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), in which we raised combined net aggregate proceeds of 83,556,563. We expect the capital from the January and March PIPE Financings to fund our Phase 2 clinical trial for obesity through top line Phase 2 data in late 2025 and the potential expansion of our metabolic program. 
 In May 2024, we entered into the ATM Agreement under which the Company may, sell up to 100,000,000 of shares of common stock through the Sales Agent. The Company has not sold any shares under the ATM Agreement as of the date hereof and is not obligated to, and cannot provide any assurances that the Company will continue to, make any sales of the shares under the ATM Agreement.

In July 2024, 1,301,573 pre-funded warrants, with an intrinsic value of 10,424,294, were exercised on a cashless basis, resulting in the issuance 1,301,410 shares of our common stock (see Note 6 to the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 In August 2024, the holder of the Convertible Note exercised their conversion option and converted the principal balance of 5,000,000 into 968,973 shares of our common stock. 
 In March of 2023, we appealed the judgment in the Cunning Lawsuit to the Ninth District Court of Appeals (the "Ninth Circuit"). In October of 2024, the Ninth Circuit issued its decision and vacated the 6,053,468 judgment and remanded the case back to the District Court for the Central District of California for a new trial. By the end of 2024, we expect to exonerate the bond and recover the 9,080,202 restriction on our cash balance to extend our cash runway and reallocate the funds to further our clinical pipeline. 
 The Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of the Company continuing as a going concern for the next 12 months. Based on its current operational requirements, the Company believes that its current cash will be sufficient to fund its projected operations for at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these trials is uncertain. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the scope, rate of progress, results and costs of our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other related activities; 
 our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; 
 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for any of nimacimab or any future drug candidates; 
 the number and characteristics of the drug candidates we seek to develop or commercialize; 
 the cost of manufacturing clinical supplies, and establishing commercial supplies, of our drug candidates; 
 the cost of commercialization activities if our current or future drug candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs; 
 the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; 
 the costs associated with being a public company; 
 the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our drug candidates, should any of our drug candidates receive marketing approval; and 
 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing possible patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of any such litigation.

In the event that any Common Stock shall be transferred to the Company to satisfy all or any part of the Purchase Price, the part of the Purchase Price deemed to have been satisfied by such transfer of Common Stock shall be equal to the product derived by multiplying the Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise times the number of shares of Common Stock transferred to the Company.

Upon a Change in Control or a merger, reorganization or other transaction following which the Company is not the surviving entity, except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement or in an employment, change in control, severance or similar agreement to which the Company and the Participant are parties, all outstanding Awards shall be treated in the manner described in the definitive transaction agreement to which the Company is party (or, if there is no such agreement, in the manner determined by the Administrator), which agreement or determination need not treat all Awards in an identical manner. The treatment specified in the definitive transaction agreement or as determined by the Administrator may include, without limitation, one or more of the following with respect to outstanding Awards 
 (i) the cancellation of Awards (whether vested or unvested) 
 20 

(ii) the assumption or substitution of Awards with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of Shares or other securities or property and applicable exercise price, base amount or purchase price 
 (iii) the acceleration of vesting of Awards 
 (iv) the cancellation of vested Awards, together with a payment to the Participants holding such vested Awards so canceled of an amount based upon the consideration being paid per Share in connection with such Change in Control or other transaction in cash or, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, in the form of such other consideration necessary for a Participant to receive property, cash or securities (or a combination thereof) as the Participant would have been entitled to receive upon such Change in Control or other transaction, if the Participant had been, immediately prior to such Change in Control, the holder of the number of Shares covered by the Award at such time, less any applicable exercise price or base amount provided, however, that holders of vested Options and vested SARs shall be entitled to such consideration only if the per-Share consideration exceeds the applicable exercise price or base amount, and to the extent that the per-Share consideration is less than or equal to the applicable exercise price or base amount, such vested Options and vested SARs shall be cancelled for no consideration or 
 (v) the replacement of Awards with a cash incentive program that preserves the value of the Awards so replaced (determined as of such Change in Control or other transaction). 
 (c) Acquisition or other Transactions . After any merger, stock purchase, asset purchase or other form of transaction in which the Company or an Affiliate shall be a surviving corporation, the Administrator may grant substituted or assumed Awards under the provisions of the Plan, pursuant to and in compliance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code or (in the case of Options issued to Canadian Persons) subsection 7(1.4) of the Income Tax Act (Canada), replacing old equity awards granted under a plan of another party to the transaction whose shares or stock subject to the old equity awards may no longer be issued following the transaction. The foregoing adjustments and manner of application of the foregoing provisions shall be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. Any such adjustments may provide for the elimination of any fractional shares which might otherwise become subject to any Options. Additionally, available shares under a stockholder approved plan of an acquired company (as appropriately adjusted to reflect such acquisition) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not be counted against the Share limit set forth in 4.01, except as required by the rules of any applicable stock exchange. 
 11.08 No Right to Continued Service . No person shall have any claim of right to be granted an Award under this Plan. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any Participant any right to be retained in the service of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 
 11.09 Awards Not Includable for Benefit Purposes . Payments received by a Participant pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall not be included in the determination of benefits under 
 21 

any pension, group insurance or other benefit plan applicable to the Participant which is maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as may be provided under the terms of such plans or determined by the Board. 
 11.10 Governing Law . All determinations made and actions taken pursuant to the Plan shall be governed by the laws of Nevada and construed in accordance therewith. 
 11.11 No Strict Construction . No rule of strict construction shall be implied against the Company, the Administrator, or any other person in the interpretation of any of the terms of the Plan, any Award granted under the Plan or any rule or procedure established by the Administrator. 
 11.12 Compliance with Rule 16b-3 . It is intended that, unless the Administrator determines otherwise, Awards under the Plan be eligible for exemption under Rule 16b-3. The Board is authorized to amend the Plan and to make any such modifications to Award Agreements to comply with Rule 16b-3, as it may be amended from time to time, and to make any other such amendments or modifications as it deems necessary or appropriate to better accomplish the purposes of the Plan in light of any amendments made to Rule 16b-3. 
 11.13 Captions . The captions (i.e., all Section headings) used in the Plan are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of the Plan, and shall not be deemed to limit, characterize or affect in any way any provisions of the Plan, and all provisions of the Plan shall be construed as if no captions have been used in the Plan. 
 11.14 Severability . Whenever possible, each provision in the Plan and every Award at any time granted under the Plan shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of the Plan or any Award at any time granted under the Plan shall be held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, then (a) such provision shall be deemed amended to accomplish the objectives of the provision as originally written to the fullest extent permitted by law and (b) all other provisions of the Plan and every other Award at any time granted under the Plan shall remain in full force and effect. 
 11.15 Amendment and Termination . 
 (a) Amendment . The Board shall have complete power and authority to amend the Plan at any time provided, however, that the Board shall not, without the requisite affirmative approval of stockholders of the Company, make any amendment which requires stockholder approval under the Code or under any other applicable law or rule of any stock exchange which lists Common Stock or Company Voting Securities. No termination or amendment of the Plan may, without the consent of the Participant to whom any Award shall theretofore have been granted under the Plan, adversely affect the right of such individual under such Award. 
 (b) Termination . The Board shall have the right and the power to terminate the Plan at any time. No Award shall be granted under the Plan after the termination of the Plan, but the termination of the Plan shall not have any other effect and any Award outstanding at the 
 22 

time of the termination of the Plan may be exercised after termination of the Plan at any time prior to the expiration date of such Award to the same extent such Award would have been exercisable had the Plan not terminated. 
 11.16 Foreign Qualified Awards . Awards under the Plan may be granted to such employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are residing in foreign jurisdictions as the Administrator in its sole discretion may determine from time to time. The Administrator may adopt such supplements to the Plan as may be necessary or appropriate to comply with the applicable laws of such foreign jurisdictions and to afford Participants favorable treatment under such laws provided, however, that no Award shall be granted under any such supplement with terms or conditions inconsistent with the provision set forth in the Plan. 
 11.17 Dividend Equivalents . For any Award granted under the Plan, the Administrator shall have the discretion, upon the Date of Grant or thereafter, to establish a Dividend Equivalent Account with respect to the Award, and the applicable Award Agreement or an amendment thereto shall confirm such establishment. If a Dividend Equivalent Account is established, the following terms shall apply 
 (a) Terms and Conditions . Dividend Equivalent Accounts shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall determine and as shall be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. Such terms and conditions may include, without limitation, for the Participant's Account to be credited as of the record date of each cash dividend on the Common Stock with an amount equal to the cash dividends which would be paid with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock then covered by the related Award if such shares of Common Stock had been owned of record by the Participant on such record date. 
 (b) Unfunded Obligation . Dividend Equivalent Accounts shall be established and maintained only on the books and records of the Company and no assets or funds of the Company shall be set aside, placed in trust, removed from the claims of the Company's general creditors, or otherwise made available until such amounts are actually payable as provided hereunder. 
 11.18 Adjustment of Performance Goals and Targets. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Administrator shall have the authority to adjust any Performance Goal, performance target or other performance-based criteria established with respect to any Award under the Plan if circumstances occur (including, but not limited to, unusual or nonrecurring events, changes in tax laws or accounting principles or practices or changed business or economic conditions) that cause any such Performance Goal, performance target or performance-based criteria to be inappropriate in the judgment of the Administrator. 
 11.19 Legality of Issuance. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan or any applicable Award Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator shall have the sole discretion to impose such conditions, restrictions and limitations (including suspending exercises of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights and the tolling of any applicable exercise period during such suspension) on the issuance of Common Stock with respect to any Award unless and until the Administrator determines that such issuance complies with (i) any applicable registration 
 23 

requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Administrator has determined that an exemption therefrom is available, (ii) any applicable listing requirement of any stock exchange on which the Common Stock is listed, (iii) any applicable Company policy or administrative rules, and (iv) any other applicable provision of state, federal or foreign law, including foreign securities laws where applicable. 
 11.20 Restrictions on Transfer. Regardless of whether the offering and sale of Common Stock under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or have been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any state, the Company may impose restrictions upon the sale, pledge, or other transfer of such Common Stock (including the placement of appropriate legends on stock certificates) if, in the judgment of the Company and its counsel, such restrictions are necessary or desirable to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the securities laws of any state, the United States or any other applicable foreign law. 
 11.21 Further Assurances. As a condition to receipt of any Award under the Plan, a Participant shall agree, upon demand of the Company, to do all acts and execute, deliver and perform all additional documents, instruments and agreements which may be reasonably required by the Company, to implement the provisions and purposes of the Plan. 
 11.22 Provisions for Foreign Participants . The Administrator will have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan, to adopt such procedures and sub-plans as are necessary or appropriate to permit and facilitate participation in the Plan by, or take advantage of specific tax treatment for Awards granted to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States (provided that Administrator approval will not be necessary for immaterial modifications to the Plan or any Award Agreement to ensure or facilitate compliance with the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction). 
 11.23 Clawback Recovery . All Awards granted under the Plan will be subject to recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that the Company is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Company s securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other Applicable Law and any clawback policy that the Company otherwise adopts, to the extent applicable and permissible under Applicable Law. In addition, the Administrator may impose such other clawback, recovery or recoupment provisions in an Award Agreement as the Administrator determines necessary or appropriate, including but not limited to a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired Shares or other cash or property upon the occurrence of Cause. No recovery of compensation under such a clawback policy will be an event giving rise to a Participant s right to voluntary terminate employment upon a resignation for good reason or for a constructive termination or any similar term under any plan of or agreement with the Company.
