 The following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the 2023 10-K. 
 Overview 
 QVC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (unless otherwise indicated or required by the context, the terms "we," "our," "us," the "Company" and "QVC" refer to QVC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries) is a retailer of a wide range of consumer products, which are marketed and sold primarily by merchandise-focused televised shopping programs, the Internet and mobile applications. QVC is comprised of the reportable segments of QxH, which includes QVC-U.S. and HSN, Inc. ("HSN"), and QVC-International. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. 
 Strategies 
 The goal of QVC is to extend its leadership in video commerce, e-commerce, streaming commerce and social commerce by continuing to create the world s most engaging shopping experiences, combining the best of retail, media, and social, highly differentiated from traditional brick-and-mortar stores or transactional e-commerce. QVC provides customers with curated collections of unique products, made personal and relevant by the power of storytelling. We curate experiences, conversations and communities for millions of highly discerning shoppers, and we also reach large audiences, across our many platforms, for our thousands of brand partners. 
 On June 27, 2022, Qurate Retail announced a five-point turnaround plan designed to stabilize and differentiate its core HSN and QVC-U.S. businesses and expand the Company's leadership in video streaming commerce Project Athens ). Project Athens main initiatives include: (i) improve customer experience and grow relationships; (ii) rigorously execute core processes; (iii) lower cost to serve; (iv) optimize the brand portfolio; and (v) build new high growth businesses. 
 Improve customer experience and grow relationships. QVC is focused on rebuilding stronger connections with their customers. In order to improve customer experience and grow relationships, QVC is working to optimize programming using advanced analytics to align product offerings, promotions and airtime with customer preferences. In addition, we are investing in infrastructure which will endeavor to improve the customer's order to delivery experience by reducing shipping time and improving shipment tracking visibility. QVC continues to focus on customer loyalty through providing customers with a more personalized shopping experience.

Rigorously execute core processes. QVC is enhancing its core processes to deliver the human story telling experience behind a product while also sharing a clear and compelling value proposition. In order to rigorously execute core processes, QVC continues to optimize pricing and assortment by investing in enhanced Information Technology ("IT") systems that support real-time pricing and promotion adjustments at an item level. QVC is also focused on growing our private label brands in effort to drive revenue and margin at a productive scale. 
 Lower cost to serve. QVC is right sizing its cost base to improve profitability and cash generation. In order to lower cost to serve, QVC has enhanced the review of spending to identify cost savings opportunities and opportunities to create new operational efficiencies, through end-to-end product and process reviews and leveraging technology and process automation. Additionally, we have improved product margin through lower fulfillment costs, freight optimization and higher productivity. 
 Optimize the brand portfolio. Qurate Retail divested Zulily in the second quarter of 2023 consistent with its goal of optimizing the brand portfolio. Qurate Retail is exploring untapped opportunities to maximize brand value. 
 Build new high growth business Finally, QVC is focused on expanding in the video streaming shopping market. In order to build new high growth businesses, QVC is working to expand streaming viewership by improving the current streaming experience with enhanced video and navigation and seamless transactions. Additionally, QVC is shaping the future streaming experience with exclusive content, program and deal concepts. We are also building a next generation shopping app featuring vendors with self-made content. 
 
 During 2022, QVC commenced the first phase of Project Athens, including actions to reduce inventory and a planned workforce reduction that was completed in February 2023. QVC recorded restructuring charges of 13 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. These initiatives are consistent with QVC s strategy to operate more efficiently as it implements its turnaround plan. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, QVC entered into an agreement and announced a plan to shift its global operating model for IT services to a managed services model. As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 QVC recorded restructuring charges of 18 million in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 Trends 
 QVC s future net revenue will depend on its ability to grow through digital platforms, retain and grow revenue from existing customers, and attract new customers. QVC's future net revenue may also be affected by (i) the willingness of cable television and direct-to-home satellite system operators to continue carrying QVC's programming service; (ii) QVC's ability to maintain favorable channel positioning, which may become more difficult due to governmental action or from distributors converting analog customers to digital; (iii) changes in television viewing habits because of video-on-demand technologies and Internet video services; (iv) QVC's ability to source new and compelling products; and (v) general economic conditions. 
 The current economic uncertainty in various regions of the world in which our subsidiaries and affiliates operate, has impacted and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and services since a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from discretionary spending by individuals, which typically falls, to varying degrees, during times of economic instability and inflationary pressures. Global financial markets may experience disruptions, including increased volatility and diminished liquidity and credit availability. If economic and financial market conditions in the U.S. or other key markets, including Japan and Europe, continue to be uncertain or deteriorate, our customers may respond by suspending, delaying or reducing their discretionary spending. Any further suspension, delay or reduction in discretionary spending could adversely affect revenue. Accordingly, our ability to increase or maintain revenue and earnings could be adversely affected to the extent that relevant economic environments decline. Such weak economic conditions may also inhibit our expansion into new European and other markets. We currently are unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. 
 The Company has continued to see inflationary pressures during the period including higher wages and merchandise costs consistent with inflation experienced by the global economy. If these pressures persist, inflated costs may result in certain increased costs outpacing our pricing power in the near term.

Due to a goodwill impairment related to the QxH reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2023, the fair value of goodwill does not significantly exceed its carrying value. The Company will continue to monitor its current business performance versus the current and updated long-term forecasts, among other relevant considerations, to determine if the carrying value of its assets (including Goodwill) is appropriate. Future outlook declines in revenue, cash flows, or other factors could result in a sustained decrease in fair value that may result in a determination that carrying value adjustments are required, which could be material. 
 Fire at Rocky Mount Fulfillment Center 
 On December 18, 2021, QVC experienced a fire at its Rocky Mount fulfillment center in North Carolina. Rocky Mount was the Company s second-largest fulfillment center, processing approximately 25 to 30 of volume for QVC-U.S., and also served as QVC-U.S. s primary returns center for hard goods. The building was significantly damaged as a result of the fire and related smoke and did not reopen. The Company took steps to mitigate disruption to operations including diverting inbound orders, leveraging its existing fulfillment centers and supplementing these facilities with short-term leased space as needed. QVC sold the property in February 2023 and received cash proceeds of 2 million and 19 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively and recognized gains on the sale of 2 million and 17 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We assessed our network footprint and are making investments to expand capacity and increase throughput as a result of the loss of the Rocky Mount fulfillment center. 
 Based on the provisions of QVC s insurance policies certain fire related costs were recoverable. In June 2023, the Company agreed to a final insurance settlement with its insurance company and received all remaining proceeds related to the Rocky Mount claim. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received 280 million of insurance proceeds, of which 210 million represented recoveries for business interruption losses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded 5 million and 32 million of fire related costs, respectively, and recognized net losses of 5 million and net gains of 208 million, respectively, representing proceeds received in excess of recoverable losses in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 Sale-leaseback Transactions 
 In November 2022, QVC-International entered into agreements to sell two properties located in Germany and the U.K. to an independent third party. Under the terms of the agreements, QVC received net cash proceeds of 102 million related to its German facility and 80 million related to its U.K. facility when the sale closed in January 2023. Concurrent with the sale, the Company entered into agreements to lease each of the properties back from the purchaser over an initial term of 20 years with the option to extend the terms of the property leases for up to four consecutive terms of five years. QVC recognized a 69 million and 44 million gain related to the successful sale-leaseback of the German and U.K. properties, respectively, during the first quarter of 2023 calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration received and the carrying value of the properties. The Company accounted for the leases as operating leases and recorded a 42 million and 32 million right-of-use asset and operating lease liability for the German and U.K. properties, respectively. 
 In December 2023, QVC entered into an agreement to sell an owned and operated property in Germany to an independent third party. This property was owned as of December 31, 2023, and is included in assets held for sale noncurrent in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Under the terms of the agreement, QVC received net cash proceeds of 6 million related to its German facility when the sale closed in February 2024. QVC recognized a 1 million gain related to the sale during the first quarter of 2024, calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration received and the carrying value of the property. Concurrent with the sale, the Company entered into an agreement to lease a portion of the property back over two years and recorded an operating lease right-of-use asset and operating lease liability of 1 million.

Net revenue 
 Net revenue by segment was as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 QxH 1,521 1,617 4,618 4,836 QVC-International 571 577 1,719 1,775 Consolidated QVC 2,092 2,194 6,337 6,611 
 QVC's consolidated net revenue decreased 102 million or 4.6 and 274 million or 4.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The three month decrease in net revenue is primarily due to a 3.9 decrease in units shipped attributable to QxH, partially offset by an increase in units shipped at QVC-International. The decrease was also driven by a 1.2 decrease in average selling price per unit ("ASP") primarily driven by QVC-International, and a 12 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue attributable to QxH. These decreases to net revenue were partially offset by a 38 million decrease in estimated product returns primarily attributable to QxH. The nine month decrease in net revenue is primarily due to a 2.7 decrease in units shipped primarily attributable to QxH, partially offset by an increase in units shipped at QVC-International. The decrease was also driven by a 0.9 decrease in ASP primarily attributable to QVC-International, partially offset by an increase in ASP at QxH, 49 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and a 19 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue attributable to QxH. These decreases to net revenue were partially offset by a 68 million decrease in estimated product returns primarily driven by QxH. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the changes in revenue and expenses were affected by changes in the exchange rates for the Japanese Yen, the Euro and the U.K. Pound Sterling. In the event the U.S. Dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies in the future, QVC's revenue and operating cash flow will be negatively affected. 
 In discussing our operating results, the term "currency exchange rates" refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the prior period's currency exchange rates. We refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Constant currency operating results refers to operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand QVC s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 The percentage change in net revenue for each of QVC's segments in U.S. Dollars and in constant currency was as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 U.S. Dollars Foreign Currency Exchange Impact Constant Currency U.S. Dollars Foreign Currency Exchange Impact Constant Currency QxH (5.9) (5.9) (4.5) (4.5) QVC-International (1.0) (0.3) (0.7) (3.2) (2.8) (0.4) 
 QxH's net revenue decline of 96 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from a 6.4 decrease in units shipped and an 11 million decrease in shipping and handling revenue. These declines were partially offset by a 30 million decrease in estimated product returns. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, QxH's net revenue decline of 218 million resulted from a 5.2 decrease in units shipped, partially offset by a 60 million decrease in estimated product returns and a 0.6 increase in ASP. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, QxH experienced shipped sales declines across all product categories.

Table of Contents 

QVC-International's net revenue declined 4 million in constant currency for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to a 3.0 decrease in ASP across all markets except Japan partially offset by a 1.4 increase in units shipped across all markets except Japan. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, QVC-International experienced shipped sales growth in constant currency in home, accessories and electronics with declines across all other product categories except jewelry which remained flat. QVC-International's net revenue declined 7 million in constant currency for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decline was due to a 3.4 decrease in ASP across all markets. These declines were primarily offset by a 3.0 increase in units shipped across all markets except Italy. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, QVC-International experienced shipped sales growth in constant currency across all product categories except for apparel and beauty. 
 Cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation, amortization and fire related costs, net) 
 QVC's cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was 65.3 and 64.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 64.9 and 66.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is driven by higher warehouse costs primarily at QxH and to a lesser extent QVC-International. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to product margin favorability across both segments and lower freight costs at QxH, partially offset by higher freight costs at QVC-International. The product margin favorability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by the net impact of merchandising efforts including cost reduction and pricing actions, as well as mix within product categories and less inventory liquidation in the current period at QxH. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 QVC's operating expenses are principally comprised of commissions, order processing and customer service expenses, credit card processing fees and telecommunications expenses. Operating expenses were 7.9 of net revenue for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and were 8.0 for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decreases in operating expenses as a percent of sales are driven by lower commissions expense at QxH. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) 
 QVC's selling, general, and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) include personnel, IT, marketing and advertising expenses, production costs and provision for doubtful accounts. Such expenses decreased 8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased as a percentage of net revenue to 14.8 from 14.4 . Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and increased as a percentage of net revenue to 14.8 from 14.6 . 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was driven by a 4 million decrease in consulting expenses and a 4 million decrease in personnel costs both at QxH. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease resulted from a 32 million decrease in consulting expenses primarily at QxH, a 6 million decrease in non-income related taxes and 5 million of favorability from foreign exchange rates. These decreases were primarily offset by a 24 million increase in marketing costs at QxH. The decrease in consulting expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to investments in Project Athens made in the prior year. The increase in marketing costs was driven by QVC's Age of Possibility campaign. 
 
 Restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) (including Rocky Mount inventory losses) 
 QVC recorded restructuring costs of 18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the shift in its IT operating model. QVC recorded a loss of 19 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a gain of 196 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of recoveries. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the loss was primarily related to a Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") civil penalty of 16 million (see note 10 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) and 5 million of other fire related costs, partially offset by a 2 million gain on the sale of the Rocky Mount property. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the gain related to a 240 million gain on insurance proceeds received in excess of fire losses and a 17 million gain on the sale of the Rocky Mount property, partially offset by 32 million of other fire related costs, the CPSC civil penalty of 16 million and 13 million of restructuring costs related to workforce reduction.

Gains on sales of assets and sale-leaseback transactions 
 QVC recorded a 1 million gain on sale of assets and sale-leaseback transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the sale-leaseback of a property in Germany. QVC recorded 119 million of gains on sales of assets and sale-leaseback transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to the sale-leaseback of two properties located in Germany and the U.K. 
 Stock-based compensation 
 Stock-based compensation includes compensation related to options and restricted stock units granted to certain officers and employees. QVC recorded 1 million and 15 million of stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and recorded 7 million and 27 million of stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to a decline in the probability of satisfying performance objectives and changes in the market price of Qurate Retail s Series A common stock. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization consisted of the following: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Customer relationships 12 12 35 35 Other technology 3 3 11 11 Acquisition related amortization 15 15 46 46 Property and equipment 19 23 58 68 Software amortization 31 36 100 93 Channel placement amortization and related expenses 22 24 63 74 Total depreciation and amortization 87 98 267 281 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, property and equipment depreciation decreased primarily due to assets that are fully depreciated in the current period. The decrease in software amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is due to software assets fully depreciating in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in software amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to software additions. The decrease in channel placement amortization and related expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to lower subscriber counts. 
 Interest expense, net 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated interest expense, net decreased 1 million as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated interest expense, net increased 24 million as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to the reversal of interest expense related to the settlement of state income tax reserves during the prior year. 
 Foreign currency (loss) gain 
 Certain loans between QVC and its subsidiaries are deemed to be short-term in nature, and accordingly, the translation of these loans is recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in foreign currency (loss) gain was due to variances in short-term loans, interest and operating payables balances between QVC and its international subsidiaries denominated in the currency of the subsidiary and the effects of currency exchange rate changes on those balances. 
 Gain on extinguishment of debt 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, QVC recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of 10 million related to the repurchase of the 2024 Notes and 2025 Notes (each defined below).

Income taxes 
 Our effective tax rate was 30.3 and 32.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to an effective tax rate of 35.1 and 29.0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The 2024 rate differs from the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 primarily due to state and foreign tax expense and permanent items. The 2023 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 primarily due to state and foreign tax expense and permanent items and includes a reversal of tax expense accrued in prior periods related to the settlement of state income tax reserves, resulting in a reduction to the 2023 rate. 
 
 Adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted OIBDA) 
 To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial statements, we disclose Adjusted OIBDA (defined below), which is a non-U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") measure. QVC defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, impairment losses, stock-based compensation and excluding restructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of recoveries (including Rocky Mount inventory losses) and gains on sale of assets and sale-leaseback transactions. QVC's chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate the businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among the businesses. QVC believes that this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of the segments by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each segment's performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows QVC to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and perform benchmarking among its businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 The primary material limitations associated with the use of Adjusted OIBDA as compared to U.S. GAAP results are (i) it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in the industry, and (ii) it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating QVC's performance. QVC compensates for these limitations by providing disclosure of the difference between Adjusted OIBDA and U.S. GAAP results, including providing a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to U.S. GAAP results, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of QVC's operating results. The following table provides a reconciliation of operating income to Adjusted OIBDA.

 QVC Adjusted OIBDA decreased by 26 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is comprised of a 19 million decrease at QxH and a 7 million decrease at QVC-International. 
 QVC Adjusted OIBDA increased by 32 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is comprised of a 36 million increase at QxH, offset by a 4 million decrease at QVC-International. 
 Seasonality 
 QVC's business is seasonal due to a higher volume of sales in the fourth calendar quarter related to year-end holiday shopping. In recent years, QVC has earned, on average, between 22 and 24 of its revenue in each of the first three quarters of the year and 30 of its revenue in the fourth quarter of the year.

Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Historically, QVC's primary sources of cash have been cash provided by operating activities and borrowings. In general, QVC uses this cash to fund its operations, make capital purchases, make dividend and tax sharing payments to Qurate Retail, make interest payments and repay borrowings. 
 As of September 30, 2024, substantially all of QVC's cash and cash equivalents were invested in AAA rated money market funds and time deposits with banks rated equal to or above A. 
 Senior Secured Notes 
 All of QVC's senior secured notes are secured by the capital stock of QVC and have equal priority to the senior secured credit facility. The interest on QVC's senior secured notes is payable semi-annually with the exception of the 6.375 Senior Secured Notes due 2067 (the "2067 Notes") and the 6.25 Senior Secured Notes due 2068 (the "2068 Notes"), which is payable quarterly. 
 During the second quarter of 2023, QVC purchased 177 million of the outstanding 4.85 Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes") and 15 million of the outstanding 4.45 Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the "2025 Notes"). As a result of the repurchases, QVC recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt in the condensed consolidated statements of operations of 10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The remaining outstanding 2024 Notes were repaid in March 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining outstanding 2025 Notes are classified within the current portion of long term debt as they mature in less than one year. 
 On September 11, 2024, QVC commenced a private offer to existing bondholders to exchange any and all of QVC s outstanding 4.75 Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes") for 350 principal amount of QVC s newly-issued 6.875 Senior Secured Notes due April 2029 (the 2029 Notes and 650 in cash per 1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes exchanged, and any and all of QVC s outstanding 4.375 Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes for 1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes per 1,000 principal amount of 2028 Notes exchanged (the Exchange ), and a private offer to purchase 2027 Notes and 2028 Notes for cash from holders who were not eligible to participate in the private exchange offer. On September 25, 2024, QVC issued an aggregate principal amount of 605 million in 2029 Notes and paid 352 million in cash consideration (including 277 million contributed by Qurate Retail) in exchange for 531 million of the 2027 Notes and 428 million of the 2028 Notes. The Exchange was accounted for as a debt modification in accordance with U.S. GAAP and fees paid to third parties were expensed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in other expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 The senior secured notes contain certain covenants, including certain restrictions on QVC and its restricted subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions), with respect to, among other things: incurring additional indebtedness; creating liens on property or assets; making certain loans or investments; selling or disposing of assets; paying certain dividends and other restricted payments; consolidating or merging; entering into certain transactions with affiliates; entering into sale or leaseback transactions; and restricting subsidiary distributions. 
 The senior secured notes permit QVC to make unlimited dividends or other restricted payments so long as QVC is not in default under the indentures governing the senior secured notes and QVC s consolidated leverage ratio is not greater than 3.5 to 1.0 (the senior secured notes leverage basket ). As of September 30, 2024, QVC s consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated under QVC s senior secured notes) was greater than 3.5 to 1.0 and as a result QVC is restricted in its ability to make dividends or other restricted payments under the senior secured notes. Although QVC will not be able to make unlimited dividends or other restricted payments under the senior secured notes leverage basket, QVC will continue to be permitted to make unlimited dividends to parent entities of QVC to service the principal and interest when due in respect of indebtedness of such parent entities (so long as there is no default under the indentures governing QVC s senior secured notes) and permitted to make certain restricted payments to Qurate Retail under an intercompany tax sharing agreement in respect of certain tax obligations of QVC and its subsidiaries.

Senior Secured Credit Facility 
 On October 27, 2021, QVC entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") with Zulily, CBI, and QVC Global Corporate Holdings, LLC ("QVC Global"), each a direct or indirect (or former, in the case of Zulily) wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail, as borrowers (collectively, the Borrowers ). The Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is a multi-currency facility providing for a 3.25 billion revolving credit facility, with a 450 million sub-limit for letters of credit and an alternative currency revolving sub-limit equal to 50 of the revolving commitments thereunder. The Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may be borrowed by any Borrower, with each Borrower jointly and severally liable for the outstanding borrowings. Borrowings bear interest at either the alternate base rate ABR Rate or a London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")-based rate (or the applicable non-U.S. Dollar equivalent rate) Term Benchmark/RFR Rate at the applicable Borrower s election in each case plus a margin. Borrowings that are ABR Rate loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the base rate plus a margin that varies between 0.25 and 0.625 depending on the Borrowers combined ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA (the consolidated leverage ratio ). Borrowings that are Term Benchmark/RFR Rate loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable rate plus a margin that varies between 1.25 and 1.625 depending on the Borrowers consolidated leverage ratio. Each loan may be prepaid at any time and from time to time without penalty other than customary breakage costs. No mandatory prepayments will be required other than when borrowings and letter of credit usage exceed availability; provided that, if CBI, QVC Global or any other borrower (other than QVC) is removed, at the election of QVC, as a borrower thereunder, all of its loans must be repaid and its letters of credit are terminated or cash collateralized. Any amounts prepaid may be reborrowed. The facility matures on October 27, 2026. Payment of loans may be accelerated following certain customary events of default. In connection with Qurate Retail's divestiture of Zulily (see note 1), Zulily is no longer a co-borrower in the senior secured credit facility, and Zulily repaid its outstanding borrowings under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement using cash contributed from Qurate Retail. 
 On June 20, 2023, QVC, QVC Global and CBI, as borrowers, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other parties thereto entered into an agreement whereby, in accordance with the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, LIBOR-based rate loans denominated in U.S. dollars made on or after June 30, 2023 would be replaced with Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR")-based rate loans. Borrowings that are SOFR-based loans will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable SOFR rate, plus a credit spread adjustment, plus a margin that varies between 1.25 and 1.625 depending on the Borrowers consolidated leverage ratio. 
 Availability under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024 was 1.75 billion. The interest rate on the senior secured credit facility was 6.5 and 6.8 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The payment and performance of the Borrowers obligations under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each of QVC s, QVC Global s and CBI s Material Domestic Subsidiaries (as defined in the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement), if any, and certain other subsidiaries of any Borrower that such Borrower has chosen to provide guarantees. Further, the borrowings under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured, pari passu with QVC s existing notes, by a pledge of all of QVC s equity interests. The borrowings under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are also secured by a pledge of all of CBI s equity interests. 
 The Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including certain restrictions on the Borrowers and each of their respective restricted subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions) with respect to, among other things: incurring additional indebtedness; creating liens on property or assets; making certain loans or investments; selling or disposing of assets; paying certain dividends and other restricted payments; dissolving, consolidating or merging; entering into certain transactions with affiliates; entering into sale or leaseback transactions; restricting subsidiary distributions; and limiting the Borrowers consolidated leverage ratio. 
 Parent Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantor Summarized Financial Information 
 The following information contains the summarized financial information for the combined parent (QVC, Inc.) and subsidiary guarantors (Affiliate Relations Holdings, Inc.; Affiliate Investment, Inc.; AMI 2, Inc.; ER Marks, Inc.; QVC Global Corporate Holdings, LLC; QVC GCH Company, LLC; QVC Rocky Mount, Inc.; QVC San Antonio, LLC; QVC Global Holdings I, Inc.; HSN, Inc; HSNi, LLC; HSN Holding LLC; Home Shopping Network En Espanol, L.P.; Home Shopping Network En Espanol, L.L.C; Ingenious Designs LLC; NLG Merger Corp.; Ventana Television, Inc.; and Ventana Television Holdings, Inc.) pursuant to Rules 3-10, 13-01 and 13-02 of Regulation S-X.

Table of Contents 

This consolidated summarized financial information has been prepared from the Company's financial information on the same basis of accounting as the Company's consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the parent and subsidiary guarantors presented on a combined basis have been eliminated. The principal elimination entries relate to investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions, such as management fees, royalty revenue and expense, interest income and expense and gains on intercompany asset transfers. Goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated to the subsidiaries based on management s estimates. Certain costs have been partially allocated to all of the subsidiaries of the Company. 
 
 The subsidiary guarantors are 100 owned by the Company. All guarantees are full and unconditional and are joint and several. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Company to obtain funds from its U.S. subsidiaries, including the guarantors, by dividend or loan. 
 
 Summarized financial information for the year-to-date interim period and the most recent annual period was as follows: 
 
 Combined Parent-QVC, Inc. and Subsidiary Guarantors September 30, 2024 Current assets 1,694 Intercompany payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries (2,470) Note receivable - related party 1,740 Noncurrent assets 5,804 Current liabilities 1,620 Noncurrent liabilities 4,181

 Other Debt Related Information 
 QVC was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 There are no restrictions under the debt agreements on QVC s ability to pay dividends or make other restricted payments if QVC is not in default on its senior secured notes or the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and (i) with respect to QVC s senior secured notes, QVC s consolidated leverage ratio would be no greater than 3.5 to 1.0 and (ii) with respect to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the consolidated net leverage basket for QVC, QVC Global and CBI, would be no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. As of September 30, 2024, QVC s consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated under QVC s senior secured notes) was greater than 3.5 to 1.0 and as a result QVC is restricted in its ability to make dividends or other restricted payments under the senior secured notes. Although QVC will not be able to make unlimited dividends or other restricted payments under the senior secured notes leverage basket, QVC will continue to be permitted to make unlimited dividends under the senior secured notes to parent entities of QVC to service the principal and interest when due in respect of indebtedness of such parent entities (so long as there is no default under the indentures governing QVC s senior secured notes) and permitted to make certain restricted payments to Qurate Retail under an intercompany tax sharing agreement in respect of certain tax obligations of QVC and its subsidiaries. 
 As a result, Qurate Retail will, in many instances, be permitted to rely on QVC s cash flow for servicing Qurate Retail s debt. These events may increase accumulated deficit or require QVC to borrow under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, increasing QVC s leverage and decreasing liquidity. QVC has made significant distributions to Qurate Retail in the past. 
 Additional Cash Flow Information 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, QVC's primary uses of cash were 1,473 million of principal payments of the senior secured credit facility and finance lease obligations, 775 million of principal repayment of senior secured notes, 141 million of capital and television distribution rights expenditures, 91 million of dividends to Qurate Retail, and 51 million in dividend payments from the Company s Japanese operations ("QVC-Japan") to Mitsui Co. LTD Mitsui ). These uses of cash were funded primarily with 1,895 million of principal borrowings from the senior secured credit facility, 346 million of cash provided by operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, QVC's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was 314 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, QVC's primary uses of cash were 1,086 million of principal payments of the senior secured credit facility and finance lease obligations, 396 million of principal repayment of senior secured notes, 344 million of dividends to Qurate Retail, 227 million of capital and television distribution rights expenditures and 35 million in dividend payments from QVC-Japan to Mitsui. These uses of cash were funded primarily with 1,022 million of principal borrowings from the senior secured credit facility, 764 million of cash provided by operating activities, 202 million in proceeds from sale of fixed assets and 54 million of insurance proceeds for fixed asset loss. As of September 30, 2023, QVC's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was 292 million. 
 The change in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the previous year was primarily due to changes in working capital and lower net income. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024, 165 million of the 314 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash in foreign subsidiaries is available for domestic purposes with no significant tax consequences upon repatriation to the U.S. QVC accrues taxes on the unremitted earnings of its international subsidiaries. Approximately 58 of this foreign cash balance was that of QVC-Japan. QVC owns 60 of QVC-Japan and shares all profits and losses with the 40 minority interest holder, Mitsui. We believe that we currently have appropriate legal structures in place to repatriate foreign cash as tax efficiently as possible and meet the business needs of QVC. 
 Other 
 QVC s material cash requirements for 2024, outside of normal operating expenses, include the costs to service outstanding debt, expenditures for affiliation agreements with television providers, and capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are expected to be between 170 and 185 million, including 118 million already expended for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company also may make dividend payments to Qurate Retail. Refer to the off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations table below for a summary of other material cash requirements as of September 30, 2024. The Company expects that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities in future periods and outstanding borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund projected uses of cash. 
 The Company may from time to time repurchase any level of its outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, redemptions, tender offers or otherwise. Repurchases or retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 QVC has contingent liabilities related to legal and tax proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although it is reasonably possible QVC may incur losses upon the conclusion of such matters, an estimate of any loss or range of loss cannot be made. In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any, that may be required to satisfy such contingencies will not be material in relation to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Off-balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
 Information concerning the amount and timing of cash requirements, both accrued and off-balance sheet, under our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 is summarized below:

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 QVC is exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to ongoing investing and financial activities and the conduct of operations by subsidiaries in different foreign countries. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in stock prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. QVC has established procedures and internal processes governing the management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks. 
 Interest rate risk 
 QVC is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing activities. Over the long-term, QVC manages the exposure to interest rates by maintaining what QVC believes is an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. 
 The table below summarizes the Company s debt obligations, related interest rates and fair value of debt at September 30, 2024: 
 (in millions, except percentages) Remainder of 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Fair Value Fixed rate debt (1) 586 44 72 2,030 2,732 2,008 Weighted average interest rate on fixed rate debt 4.5 4.8 4.4 6.2 5.8 N/A Variable rate debt 1,280 1,280 1,280 Average interest rate on variable rate debt 6.5 6.5 N/A 
 (1) Amounts exclude finance lease obligations and the issue discounts on the 4.45 , 5.45 and 5.95 senior secured notes. 
 N/A - Not applicable. 
 Foreign currency exchange rate risk 
 QVC is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to the monetary assets and liabilities and the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end exchange rates, and the statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholder's equity. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains and losses, which are reflected in income as unrealized (based on period-end transactions) or realized upon settlement of the transactions. Cash flows from operations in foreign countries are translated at the average rate for the period. Accordingly, QVC may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to its holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. QVC's reported Adjusted OIBDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been impacted by approximately 1 million and 2 million, respectively, for every 1 change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. 
 The Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides QVC with the ability to borrow in multiple currencies. This allows QVC to somewhat mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks. As of September 30, 2024, no borrowings in foreign currencies were outstanding.
