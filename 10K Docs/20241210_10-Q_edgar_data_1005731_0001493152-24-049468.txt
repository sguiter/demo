NRS segment is an operator of a nationwide point-of-sale POS network providing independent retailers with store management
software, electronic payment processing, and other ancillary merchant services. NRS POS platform provides marketers with digital
out-of-home advertising and transaction data. 

The
Fintech segment is comprised of: (i) BOSS Money, a provider of international money remittance and related value/payment transfer

operating results of these business segments are regularly reviewed by the Company s chief operating decision maker. The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as the accounting policies of the Company as a whole. There are no significant asymmetrical allocations
to segments. The Company evaluates the performance of its business segments based primarily on income (loss) from operations.

Accounts
Receivable and Contract Balances 

The
timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to the Company s customers. Trade accounts receivable in the
Company s consolidated balance sheets represent unconditional rights to consideration. The Company would record a contract asset
when revenue is recognized in advance of its right to bill and receive consideration. The Company has not currently identified any contract
assets. 

Contract
liabilities arise when the Company receives consideration or bills its customers prior to providing the goods or services promised in
the contract. The Company s contract liability balance is primarily payments received for prepaid BOSS Revolution. Contract liabilities
are recognized as revenue when services are provided to the customer. The contract liability balances are presented in the Company s
consolidated balance sheets as Deferred revenue . 

Deferred
Customer Contract Acquisition and Fulfillment Costs 

The
Company recognizes as an asset its incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer that it expects to recover. The Company s
incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are sales commissions paid to employees and third parties on sales to end users.
If the amortization period were one year or less for the asset that would be recognized from deferring these costs, the Company applies
the practical expedient whereby the Company charges these costs to expense when incurred. 

The
Company s costs to fulfill its contracts do not meet the criteria to be recognized as an asset, therefore these costs are charged
to expense as incurred.

The
gross unrealized losses in the table above are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance
sheets. As of October 31, 2024, the Company determined that the unrealized losses were due to changes in interest rates or market liquidity
and were not due to credit losses. In addition, as of October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, the Company did not intend to sell any of the
securities with unrealized losses, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell any of these securities
before recovery of the unrealized losses, which may be at maturity. 

Proceeds
from maturities and sales of debt securities and redemptions of equity investments were million and million in the three
months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were no realized gains or realized losses from sales of debt securities in
the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company uses the specific identification method in computing the realized gains
and realized losses on the sales of debt securities.

The
Company adjusted the carrying value of the shares of Visa Series C Preferred it held based on the fair value of Visa Class A common stock,
including a discount for lack of current marketability, which is classified as Adjustment for observable transactions involving
a similar investment from the same issuer in the table above. The Certificate of Designation with respect to the shares of Visa
Series C Preferred restricts the transferability of the shares, there is no public market for the shares, and none is expected to develop.
The shares become fully convertible into shares of Visa Class A common stock in June 2028. In addition, in the three months ended October

Equity Method Investment 

The
Company has an investment in shares of convertible preferred stock of a communications company (the equity method investee, or EMI ).
As of both October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, the Company s ownership was of the EMI s outstanding shares on an as
converted basis. The Company accounts for this investment using the equity method since the Company can exercise significant influence
over the operating and financial policies of the EMI but does not have a controlling interest. 

The
Company determined that on the dates of the acquisitions of the EMI s shares, there were differences between its investment in
the EMI and its proportional interest in the equity of the EMI of an aggregate of million, which represented the share of the EMI s
customer list on the dates of the acquisitions attributed to the Company s interest in the EMI. In the accompanying consolidated statements of income, amortization of
equity method basis difference is included in the equity in the net loss of investee, which is recorded in Other expense, net 
(see Note 17). 

In
both the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, each of the EMI s shareholders, including the Company, purchased
additional shares of the EMI s convertible preferred stock. At October 31, 2024, the Company was committed to purchase
additional shares of the EMI s convertible preferred stock in January 2025 for 
million.

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 

The estimated fair value of the Company s other financial instruments was determined using available market information or other
appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting these data to develop estimates of fair
value. Consequently, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current
market exchange. 

Cash
and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, settlement assets, disbursement prefunding, other current assets,
customer funds deposits, settlement liabilities, and other current liabilities. At October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, the
carrying amount of these assets and liabilities approximated fair value because of the short period of time to maturity. The fair
value estimates for cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents were classified as Level 1 and settlement
assets, disbursement prefunding, other current assets, customer funds deposits, settlement liabilities, and other current

Sales
Tax Contingency 

On
June 21, 2018, the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., holding that a state may require
a remote seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales tax on goods and services provided to purchasers in
the state, overturning certain existing court precedent. It is possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that the Company has
liability for periods for which it has not collected sales, use or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were successful
it could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial position, and operating results. One or more jurisdictions
may change their laws or policies to apply their sales, use or other similar taxes to the Company s operations, and if such changes
were made it could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial position, and operating results.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 

In
November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2024-03, Income
Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) , to improve the disclosures about an
entity s expenses including more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. At each
interim and annual reporting period, entities will disclose in tabular format disaggregating information about prescribed categories
underlying relevant income statement captions, as well as the total amount of selling expense and a description of the composition of
its selling expense. We will adopt the amendments in this ASU for our fiscal year beginning on August 1, 2027. We are evaluating the
impact that this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) , Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ,
primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures as well as certain other amendments to income tax
disclosures. Entities will be required on an annual basis to consistently categorize and provide greater disaggregation of rate
reconciliation information and further disaggregate their income taxes paid. We will adopt the amendments in this ASU for
our fiscal year beginning on August 1, 2025. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis, although
retrospective application is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that this ASU will have on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) , Accounting
for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets , that changes the accounting for crypto assets from a cost-less-impairment model to fair value,
with changes recognized in net income each reporting period. The ASU also requires enhanced disclosures including, among other things,
the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant holding, and a rollforward of annual activity including additions,
dispositions, gains, and losses. We will adopt the amendments in this ASU for our fiscal year beginning on August 1, 2025. The
ASU requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of adoption. We are evaluating the
impact that this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

Results
of Operations 

We
evaluate the performance of our business segments based primarily on income (loss) from operations. Accordingly, the income and expense
line items below income (loss) from operations are only included in our discussion of the consolidated results of operations. 

As
of October 31, 2024, we owned 94.0 of the outstanding shares of our subsidiary, net2phone 2.0, Inc., or net2phone 2.0, which owns and
operates the net2phone segment, and 81.5 of the outstanding shares of National Retail Solutions, or NRS. On a fully diluted basis
assuming all the vesting criteria related to various rights granted have been met, we would own 90.3 of the equity of net2phone 2.0 and 79.3 of NRS. 

Reclassification 

From
and after February 1, 2024, we reclassified most of our technology and development expenses from Selling, general and administrative 
expense to a new Technology and development expense caption in the consolidated statements of income and reclassified an
amount that was immaterial in all periods to Direct cost of revenues. The following table shows the amounts that were reclassified
in the three months ended October 31, 2023 to conform to the current period s presentation:

Explanation
of Performance Metrics 

Our
results of operations discussion include the following performance metrics: 

for
 NRS, active point-of-sale, or POS, terminals, payment processing accounts, and recurring
 revenue, 
 
 for
 net2phone, seats and subscription revenue, and 
 
 for
 Traditional Communications, minutes of use. 

NRS
uses two key metrics to measure the size of its customer base: active POS terminals and payment processing accounts. Active POS terminals
are the number of POS terminals that have completed at least one transaction in the calendar month. It excludes POS terminals that have
not been fully installed by the end of the month. Payment processing accounts are accounts that can generate revenue. It excludes
accounts that have been approved but not activated. NRS recurring revenue is NRS revenue in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, excluding its revenue from POS terminal sales. 

net2phone s
cloud communications offerings are priced on a per-seat basis, with customers paying based on the number of users in their organization.
net2phone s subscription revenue is its revenue in accordance with U.S. GAAP excluding its equipment revenue and revenue generated
by a legacy SIP trunking offering in Brazil. 

The
trends and comparisons between periods for the number of active POS terminals, payment processing accounts, seats served, recurring revenue, and
subscription revenue are used in the analysis of NRS or net2phone s revenues and direct cost of revenues and are strong
indications of the top-line growth and performance of the business. 

Minutes
of use is a nonfinancial metric that measures aggregate customer usage during a reporting period. Minutes of use is an important factor
in BOSS Revolution s and IDT Global s revenue recognition since satisfaction of our performance obligation occurs when the
customer uses our service. Minutes of use trends and comparisons between periods are used in the analysis of revenues and direct cost
of revenues.

Money s revenue. 

Selling,
General and Administrative . Selling, general and administrative expense increased in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared
to the similar period in fiscal 2024 primarily due to increases in debit and credit card processing charges, employee compensation, and
bank fees. The increase in card processing charges was the result of increased credit and debit card transactions through our BOSS Money
app and other digital channels. As a percentage of Fintech s revenue, Fintech s selling, general and administrative expense
decreased to 43.3 from 53.3 in the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Revenues. net2phone s
revenues increased in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the similar period in fiscal 2024 driven primarily by the
growth in subscription revenue primarily in the U.S. and Mexico, which reflected the increase in seats served at
October 31, 2024 compared to October 31, 2023. 

Direct
Cost of Revenues . Direct cost of revenues increased in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the similar period in
fiscal 2024 primarily due to the increase in revenues, with the largest increase in the U.S. market. net2phone s focus on mid-sized
businesses, multi-channel strategies, and localized offerings generated revenue growth that exceeded the increase in direct cost of revenues. 

Selling,
General and Administrative . Selling, general and administrative expense decreased in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared
to the similar period in fiscal 2024 primarily due to decreases in marketing expense, employee compensation, and consulting expense, partially offset by an increase in sales commissions.
As a percentage of net2phone s revenues, net2phone s selling, general and administrative expense decreased to 60.8 from
66.6 in the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Technology
and Development . Technology and development expense increased in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the similar

Traditional Communications Segment 

The
Traditional Communications segment, which represented 71.2 and 76.6 of our total revenues in the three months ended October 31, 2024
and 2023, respectively, includes: (i) IDT Digital Payments, which enables customers to transfer airtime and bundles of airtime, messaging,
and data to international and domestic mobile accounts; (ii) BOSS Revolution, an international long-distance calling service marketed
primarily to immigrant communities in the United States and Canada; and (iii) IDT Global, a wholesale provider of international voice
and SMS termination and outsourced traffic management solutions to telecoms worldwide. Traditional Communications also includes other
small businesses and offerings including early-stage business initiatives and mature businesses in harvest mode. 

Traditional
Communications most significant revenue streams are from IDT Digital Payments, BOSS Revolution, and IDT Global. IDT Digital Payments
and BOSS Revolution are sold directly to consumers and through distributors and retailers. We receive payments for BOSS Revolution, traditional
calling cards, and IDT Digital Payments prior to providing the services. We recognize the revenue when services are provided to the customer.
Traditional Communications revenues tend to be somewhat seasonal, with the second fiscal quarter (which contains Christmas and
New Year s Day) and the fourth fiscal quarter (which contains Mother s Day and Father s Day) typically showing higher
minute volumes.

Revenues. Revenues
from IDT Digital Payments increased in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the similar period in fiscal 2024
primarily due to increases in revenues from the direct-to-consumer and enterprise and wholesale channels, partially offset by a
decrease in revenues from the retail channel. 

Revenues
and minutes of use from BOSS Revolution decreased in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the similar period in fiscal
2024. BOSS Revolution continues to be impacted by persistent, market-wide trends, including the proliferation of unlimited calling plans
offered by wireless carriers and mobile virtual network operators, and the increasing penetration of free and paid over-the-top voice,
video conferencing, and messaging services. 

Revenues
from IDT Global slightly increased in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the similar period in fiscal 2024. Minutes
of use from IDT Global slightly decreased in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the similar period in fiscal 2024. IDT Global s revenues and minutes of use generally decline each fiscal quarter
as communications globally continue to transition away from international voice calling. This trend was accelerated by the impact
of COVID-19 as business communications shifted from calling to video conferencing and other collaboration platforms. We expect that
IDT Global will continue to be adversely impacted by these trends, and minutes of use and revenues will likely continue to decline
from quarter-to-quarter, as we seek to maximize economics rather than necessarily sustain minutes of use or revenues. 

Direct
Cost of Revenues . Direct cost of revenues decreased in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the similar period in
fiscal 2024 primarily due to the decrease in BOSS Revolution s minutes of use and direct cost of revenues. 

Selling,
General and Administrative . Selling, general and administrative expense decreased in the three months ended October 31, 2024
compared to the similar period in fiscal 2024 primarily due to decreases in sales commissions and employee compensation, partially
offset by increases in marketing expense and stock-based compensation. As a percentage of Traditional Communications revenue,
Traditional Communications selling, general and administrative expense increased to 9.1 from 8.9 in the three months ended
October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Technology
and Development . Technology and development expense decreased in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the similar
period in fiscal 2024 primarily due to decreases in depreciation and amortization expense, employee compensation, and software
license and maintenance expense. 

Severance
Expense. In the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, Traditional Communications incurred severance expense of 0.2 million
and 0.5 million, respectively.

Corporate
costs mainly include compensation, consulting fees, treasury, tax and accounting services, human resources, corporate purchasing, corporate
governance including Board of Directors fees, internal and external audit, investor relations, corporate insurance, corporate
legal, and other corporate-related general and administrative expenses. Corporate does not generate any revenues, nor does it incur any
direct cost of revenues. 

General
and Administrative. Corporate general and administrative expense increased in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to
the similar period in fiscal 2024 primarily because of an increase in audit and accounting fees, partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation. As a percentage
of our consolidated revenues, Corporate general and administrative expense was 0.9 in both the three months ended October 31, 2024
and 2023. 

Other Operating Gain, net .
As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 to Part I of this Quarterly Report, we (as well as
other defendants) were named in a class action on behalf of the stockholders of our former subsidiary, Straight Path Communications Inc.,
or Straight Path. We incurred legal fees of nil and 0.2 million in the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
related to this action. Also, we recorded offsetting gains from insurance claims for this matter of nil and 0.7 million in the three
months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In fiscal 2024, we received the final payment from our insurance policy for these
claims. On October 3, 2023, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismissed all claims against us, and found that, contrary
to the plaintiffs allegations, the class suffered no damages. The plaintiffs will have 30 days from entry of the final order to
file an appeal. 

Consolidated 

The
following is a discussion of our consolidated stock-based compensation expense, and our consolidated income and expense line items below
income from operations. 

Stock-Based
Compensation Expense. Total stock-based compensation expense included in consolidated selling, general and administrative expense
and technology and development expense was 0.9 million and 0.8 million in the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to certain equity grants to Bill Pereira, our President and Chief
Operating Officer, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, including a contingent bonus subject to the completion of certain financial
milestones that may be paid, at Mr. Pereira s option, in either shares of our Class B common stock or cash. The increase in stock-based
compensation expense was partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense from the grant of deferred stock units, or
DSUs, that, upon vesting, will entitle the grantees to receive shares of our Class B common stock. As of October 31, 2024, there was
 1.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested DSUs , which is being recognized on a graded vesting
basis over the requisite service periods that end in October 2027. 

Effective
as of June 30, 2022, restricted shares of NRS Class B common stock were granted to certain NRS employees. The restrictions on
the shares lapse in three installments, the first was on June 1, 2024, and the others are June 1, 2026 and June 1, 2027. As of October
31, 2024, unrecognized compensation cost related to NRS non-vested Class B common stock was an aggregate of 1.8 million. The
unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period that ends in fiscal 2027. 

As of October 31, 2024, there was an aggregate of 0.8 million in unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting
periods that end in fiscal 2028.

We
have an investment in shares of convertible preferred stock of a communications company (the equity method investee, or EMI). As of October
31, 2024 and 2023, our ownership was 33.4 and 33.3 , respectively, of the EMI s outstanding shares on an as converted basis. We
account for this investment using the equity method since we can exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies
of the EMI but do not have a controlling interest. We determined that on the dates of the acquisitions of the EMI s shares, there
were differences between our investment in the EMI and our proportional interest in the equity of the EMI of an aggregate of 8.2 million,
which represented the share of the EMI s customer list on the dates of the acquisitions attributed to our interest in the EMI.
These basis differences are being amortized over the 6-year estimated life of the customer list. Equity in the net loss of investee 
includes the amortization of equity method basis difference. 

Provision
for Income Taxes. The change in income tax expense in the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the similar period in fiscal
2024 was primarily due to differences in the amount of taxable income earned in the various taxing jurisdictions. 

Net
Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests . The change in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the three
months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the similar period in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to increases in net income attributable to the
noncontrolling interests in net2phone 2.0, NRS, and the VIE, partially offset by a decrease in net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in Sochitel. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, we expect our cash flow from operations and the balance of cash, cash equivalents, debt securities,
and current equity investments that we held on October 31, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital
and capital expenditure requirements during the twelve-month period ending October 31, 2025. 

At
October 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, debt securities, and current equity investments of 180.4 million and working capital
(current assets in excess of current liabilities) of 161.9 million.

Operating Activities 

Our
cash flow from operations varies significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, depending on our operating results and
the timing of operating cash receipts and payments, generally trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities to 0.2 million from 14.8 million in the three months
ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, predominantly reflects the timing of our payments to cover anticipated BOSS Money disbursement
prefunding. 

Gross trade accounts receivable decreased to 48.2 million at October 31,
2024 from 48.6 million at July 31, 2024 primarily due to collections in the three months ended October 31, 2024 that were greater than
amounts billed during the period, as well as from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Deferred revenue arises from sales of prepaid products and varies from
period to period depending on the mix and the timing of revenues. Deferred revenue decreased to 29.3 million at October 31, 2024 from
 30.4 million at July 31, 2024 primarily due to decreases in the BOSS Revolution s and traditional calling cards deferred
revenue balances. 

Customer funds deposits liabilities increased to 95.0 million at October
31, 2024 from 91.9 million at July 31, 2024. Our restricted cash and cash equivalents included an aggregate of 95.0 million and 90.7
million at October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively, held by IDT Financial Services and our VIE for these customer funds. 

In
September 2017, we and certain of our subsidiaries were certified by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, or NJEDA, as having
met the requirements of the Grow New Jersey Assistance Act Tax Credit Program. The program provides for credits against a corporation s
New Jersey corporate business tax liability for maintaining a minimum number of employees in New Jersey, and that tax credits may be
sold subject to certain conditions. On June 5, 2023, we received a 2019 tax credit certificate for 1.8 million from the NJEDA. In August
2023, we sold the certificate for cash of 1.6 million. 

On
June 21, 2018, the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., holding that a state may require
a remote seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales tax on goods and services provided to purchasers in
the state, overturning certain existing court precedent. It is possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability
for periods for which we have not collected sales, use or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were successful
it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, and operating results. One or more jurisdictions may change
their laws or policies to apply their sales, use or other similar taxes to our operations, and if such changes were made it could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial position, and operating results. 

As
discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 to Part I of this Quarterly Report, we (as well as other
defendants) were named in a class action on behalf of the stockholders of our former subsidiary, Straight Path. On October 3, 2023, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismissed all claims against us, and found that, contrary to the plaintiffs allegations,
the class suffered no damages. The plaintiffs will have 30 days from entry of the final order to file an appeal. 

Investing Activities 

Our
capital expenditures were 5.3 million and 4.3 million in the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We currently
anticipate that total capital expenditures in the twelve-month period ending October 31, 2025 will be 19 million to 20 million. We
expect to fund our capital expenditures with our net cash provided by operating activities and cash, cash equivalents, debt securities,
and current equity investments on hand. 

In
both the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, each of the EMI s shareholders, including us, purchased additional shares
of the EMI s convertible preferred stock. We paid an aggregate of 0.7 million in both the three months ended
October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to purchase additional shares. At October 31, 2024, we were committed to purchase
additional shares of the EMI s convertible preferred stock in January 2025 for 0.3 million. 

29 

Purchases
of debt securities and equity investments were 12.7 million and 7.8 million in the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Proceeds from maturities and sales of debt securities and redemptions of equity investments were 9.9 million and 17.1 million in the
three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Financing Activities 

In
the three months ended October 31, 2024, we paid a cash dividend of 0.05 per share on our Class A and Class B common stock. In the three months ended October 31, 2024, we paid aggregate cash dividends of 1.3 million. 

We
distributed cash of nil and 0.1 million in the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to the noncontrolling
interests in certain of our subsidiaries. 

Our
subsidiary, IDT Telecom, Inc., or IDT Telecom, entered into a credit agreement, dated as of May 17, 2021, with TD Bank, N.A. for a revolving
credit facility for up to a maximum principal amount of 25.0 million. As of July 15, 2024 and July 28, 2023, IDT Telecom and TD Bank,
N.A. amended certain terms of the credit agreement. IDT Telecom may use the proceeds to finance working capital requirements and for
certain closing costs of the facility. At October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility.
In the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, IDT Telecom borrowed and repaid an aggregate of 14.2 million and 30.3 million
, respectively, under the facility. The revolving credit facility is secured by primarily all of IDT Telecom s assets. The principal
outstanding bears interest per annum at the secured overnight financing rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 10
basis points, plus depending upon IDT Telecom s leverage ratio as computed for the most recent fiscal quarter, 125 to 175 basis
points. Interest is payable monthly, and all outstanding principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due on May 16, 2026. IDT Telecom
pays a quarterly unused commitment fee of 10 basis points on the average daily balance of the unused portion of the 25.0 million commitment.
IDT Telecom is required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants as well as maintain certain targets based on financial
ratios during the term of the revolving credit facility. As of October 31, 2024, IDT Telecom was in compliance with all of the covenants. 

In
the three months ended October 31, 2023, we received cash from the exercise of stock options of 0.2 million for which we issued 12,500
shares of our Class B common stock. There were no stock option exercises in the three months ended October 31, 2024. 

We
have an existing stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors for the repurchase of shares of our Class B common stock.
In January 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 8.0 million shares in the aggregate. In the three months ended October 31,
2024, we repurchased 37,714 shares of our Class B common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 1.3 million. In the three months ended
October 31, 2023, we repurchased 125,470 shares of our Class B common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 2.8 million. At October
31, 2024, 4.4 million shares remained available for repurchase under the stock repurchase program. 

In
the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, we paid 1.1 million and 15,000, respectively, to repurchase 24,290 and 654 shares, respectively,
of our Class B common stock that were tendered by employees of ours to satisfy the employees tax withholding obligations in connection
with the lapsing of restrictions on restricted stock and shares issued for bonus payments. Such shares were repurchased
by us based on their fair market value as of the close of business on the trading day immediately prior to the vesting date. 

Other
Sources and Uses of Resources 

From time to time we consider spin-offs and other potential dispositions of certain of our subsidiaries. A spin-off may include the contribution of a significant amount of cash, cash equivalents,
debt securities, and/or equity securities to the subsidiary prior to the spin-off, which would reduce our capital resources. There is
no assurance that a transaction will be completed. 

We
intend to, where appropriate, make strategic investments and acquisitions to complement, expand, and/or enter into new businesses. In
considering acquisitions and investments, we search for opportunities to profitably grow our existing businesses and/or to add qualitatively
to the range and diversification of businesses in our portfolio. We cannot guarantee that we will be presented with acquisition opportunities
that meet our return-on-investment criteria, or that our efforts to make acquisitions that meet our criteria will be successful. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks 

Foreign
Currency Risk 

Revenues
from our international operations were 21 and 26 of our consolidated revenues in the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. A significant portion of our revenues is in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our foreign currency exchange risk is
somewhat mitigated by our ability to offset a portion of these non-U.S. Dollar-denominated revenues with operating expenses that are
paid in the same currencies. While the impact from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affects our revenues and expenses denominated
in foreign currencies, the net amount of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes at the end of each reporting period is
generally not material. 

Investment
Risk 

We
hold a portion of our assets in debt and equity securities, including hedge funds, for strategic and speculative purposes. At October
31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, the value of our debt and equity security holdings was an aggregate of 39.4 million and 35.0 million, respectively,
which represented 7 and 6 of our total assets at October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024, respectively. Investments in debt and equity securities
carry a degree of risk and depend to a great extent on correct assessments of the future course of price movements of securities and
other instruments. There can be no assurance that our investment managers will be able to accurately predict these price movements. The
securities markets have in recent years been characterized by great volatility and unpredictability. Accordingly, the value of our investments
may go down as well as up and we may not receive the amounts originally invested upon redemption. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended),
as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal
quarter ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
