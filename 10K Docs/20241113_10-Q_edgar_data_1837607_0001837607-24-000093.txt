NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS shares of Class A common stock, par value per share common stock ), which Old AEON s stockholders received in the form of shares of common stock of the Company (the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, collectively, the Merger ). In addition, following the closing of the Merger (the Closing ), certain AEON stockholders will be issued up to additional shares of common stock to the extent certain milestones are achieved. Prior to the Closing, Priveterra shares were listed on Nasdaq as PMGM. The post-Merger Company common stock and warrants commenced trading on the NYSE American under the symbols AEON and AEON WS, respectively, on July 24, 2023. See Note 3 Forward Merger for additional details. Liquidity and Going Concern The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has experienced recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company reported cash and cash equivalents of million and an accumulated deficit of million. The Company expects to incur losses and use cash in its operations for the foreseeable future. On May 3, 2024, the Company announced preliminary top-line results from its planned interim analysis of the Phase 2 trial with ABP-450 in the preventative treatment of chronic migraine, which did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints. The Company originally intended to pursue submission of an Original BLA seeking one or more potential therapeutic indications for ABP-450. However, in May 2024, the Company announced the discontinuation of its Phase 2 clinical trials for episodic and chronic migraine in order to implement certain cash preservation measures. On July 9, 2024, the Company announced a strategic reprioritization to pursue a Section 351(k) biosimilar regulatory pathway for ABP-450, using AbbVie Inc. s product Botox as a proposed reference product. The Company held an initial meeting with the FDA in the third quarter of 2024 during which it aligned with the FDA on next steps to develop a Botox biosimilar. The Company anticipates commencing comparative analytic studies in the fourth quarter of 2024 and preparing for a potential Biosimilar Biological Product Development BPD meeting with the FDA in 2025 to review the results from the studies. On August 14, 2024, the Company entered into an at-the-market sales agreement with Leerink Partners LLC Leerink Partners relating to an at-the-market offering program (the ATM ), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of common stock, registered pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC declared effective on August 21, 2024, having aggregate gross proceeds of up to

 million through Leerink Partners as sales agent. As of September 30, 2024, the Company issued shares under the ATM for net proceeds of thousand and approximately million of common stock remained available to be sold under the ATM. See Note 8 Common Stock for additional information. The commencement of studies, preparation for the potential BPD meeting and any further development of ABP-450 would require additional funding in the form of equity financings or debt. There can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that, in the event that they are successful, the terms and conditions of such financing will be commercially acceptable. Furthermore, the use of equity as a source of financing would dilute existing shareholders. The Company is actively attempting to secure additional capital to fund its operations. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. As a result of these conditions, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern and to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements does not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Company s assets and the satisfaction of the Company s liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. The Company s future operations are highly dependent on a combination of factors, including (1) the success of its research and development programs; (2) the timely and successful completion of any additional financing; (3) the development of competitive therapies by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies; (4) the Company s ability to manage growth of the organization; (5) the Company s ability to protect its technology and products; and, ultimately (6) regulatory approval and successful commercialization and market acceptance of its product candidates.

In addition, each share of Priveterra Class B common stock Founder Shares ), par value per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time converted into share of common stock totaling shares of common stock (of which Founder Shares are subject to certain vesting and forfeiture conditions). In connection with the Merger, on January 6, 2023, Priveterra and Old AEON entered into separate subscription agreements for convertible notes with each of Alphaeon 1 LLC A1 and Daewoong (collectively, the Original Committed Financing Agreements ), pursuant to which A1 and Daewoong agreed to purchase, and Priveterra and Old AEON agreed to sell to each of them, up to million and million, respectively, aggregate of principal of interim convertible notes or equity. Further, on June 8, 2023, Old AEON and Priveterra entered into a committed financing agreement with A1 (the Additional Committed Financing Agreement ), pursuant to which A1 agreed to purchase, and Priveterra and Old AEON agreed to sell to A1, up to an additional million aggregate principal of interim convertible notes or equity. Pursuant to such agreement, Old AEON issued million of interim convertible notes to A1 in the first and second quarters of 2023. The notes were subsequently measured at fair value under a fair value option election, with changes in fair value reported in earnings of the Predecessor (Old AEON). Conversion of the notes was contingent and automatically convertible on the Merger, and shares of Priveterra Class A common stock were issued on the Closing Date in settlement of their conversion. The proceeds from the interim convertible notes were used to fund Old AEON s operations through the consummation of the Merger. Additionally, approximately million was received on the Closing Date in exchange for an aggregate of shares of Priveterra Class A common stock at per share that were issued under the Original Committed Financing Agreements and Additional Committed Financing Agreements, and reflected on the line in the Successor s opening accumulated deficit. On April 27, 2023, Priveterra and AEON amended the Business Combination Agreement. Concurrently with the amendment to the Business Combination Agreement, Priveterra amended the Sponsor Support Agreement to include restriction and forfeiture provisions related to the Founder Shares. See Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for additional information. The fair value of the contingent consideration at the Closing was valued to be million, and is included in the purchase price. Additionally, the Successor assumed the Predecessor s 2019 Incentive Award Plan, and as such, the fair value of the replacement awards of million were included in purchase consideration, million related to stock options and million related to restricted stock units. See Note 9 Share-based Compensation for additional information. Asset Acquisition Method of Accounting The Merger was accounted for using the asset acquisition method in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Priveterra was considered to be the accounting acquirer based on the terms of the Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger, the cash on hand resulted in the equity at risk being considered insufficient for Old AEON to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. Therefore, Old AEON was considered a Variable Interest Entity VIE and the primary beneficiary of Old AEON was treated as the accounting acquirer. Priveterra held a variable interest in Old AEON and owned of Old AEON s equity. Priveterra was considered the primary beneficiary as it has the decision-making rights that gives it the power to direct the most significant activities. Also, Priveterra retained the obligation to absorb the losses and/or receive the benefits of Old AEON that could have potentially been significant to Old AEON. The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value was concentrated in IPR D, an intangible asset. Old AEON s assets (except for cash) and liabilities

 million at the Closing was written off to the Successor s consolidated statement of operations for the period ended September 30, 2023. To estimate the value of the acquired IPR D, the Company used a Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method under the Income Approach. The determination of the fair value requires management to make significant estimates including, but not limited to, the discount rate used, the total addressable market for each potential drug, market penetration assumptions, and the estimated timing of commercialization of the drugs. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the IPR D. The significant assumptions used in determining IPR D was the discount rate of , implied internal rate of return of and long-term growth rate of .

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in the sections of this Report captioned Risk Factors and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements , actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to we , us , our and the Company refer to the business and operations of AEON Biopharma, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Merger Old AEON or the Predecessor and to AEON Biopharma, Inc. AEON following the consummation of the Merger. On December 12, 2022, Old AEON and Priveterra Acquisition Corp. Priveterra ), a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses, entered into a Business Combination and Merger Agreement (the Business Combination Agreement ). On July 21, 2023, the parties consummated the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (collectively referred to as the Merger ). In connection with the closing of the Merger (the Closing ), Priveterra changed its name from Priveterra Acquisition Corp. to AEON Biopharma, Inc. Priveterra was deemed the accounting acquirer in the Merger based on an analysis of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations. Old AEON was deemed to be the predecessor entity based on an analysis of the criteria outlined in the Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Old AEON became the historical financial statements of the combined company upon the consummation of the Merger. As a result, the financial statements included in this report reflect (i) the historical operating results of Old AEON prior to the Merger; and (ii) the combined results of the Company following the Closing. The accompanying financial information includes a predecessor period, which includes the periods through July 21, 2023 concurrent with the Merger, and the successor period starting from July 22, 2023 through the date of this report. A black-line between the Successor and Predecessor periods has been placed in the condensed consolidated financial statements and in the tables to the notes to the statements to highlight the lack of comparability between these two periods and differentiate the cut-off of these periods. Overview We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing our botulinum toxin complex, prabotulinumtoxinA injection ABP-450 ), for debilitating medical conditions, with an initial focus on the neurosciences market. We plan to develop and seek regulatory approval of ABP-450 as a biosimilar product in the United States through submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, under Section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act, or a Section 351(k) BLA, with the goal of addressing the estimated 3.0 billion global therapeutic botulinum toxin market , which is projected to grow to 4.4 billion in 2027, according to the Decision Resources Group Therapeutic Botulinum Toxin Market Analysis Global as of 2021 . ABP-450 is the same botulinum toxin complex that is currently approved as a biosimilar in Mexico and India and, in the U.S. is approved to provide temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines for certain adult patients and marketed by Evolus, Inc. under the name Jeuveau in the United States and Nuceiva in Canada and the European Union. We have exclusive development and distribution rights for certain therapeutic uses of ABP-450 in the United States, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and certain other international territories. We have built a highly experienced management team with specific experience in biopharmaceutical and botulinum toxin development and commercialization. We have completed a Phase 2 study of ABP-450 for the treatment of cervical dystonia and completed enrollment and dosing of patients for a Phase 2 double blind study of ABP-450 for the treatment of both chronic and episodic migraine. We originally intended to pursue a submission of a BLA under Section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act, or an Original BLA, seeking one or more potential therapeutic indications for ABP-450. However, our Phase 2 clinical trials for episodic and chronic migraine did not meet their respective primary endpoints. In May 2024, we announced the discontinuation of our Phase 2 clinical trials for episodic and chronic migraine in order to implement certain cash preservation measures. On July 9, 2024, we announced a strategic reprioritization to pursue a 351(k) biosimilar regulatory pathway for ABP-450, using AbbVie Inc. s product Botox as a proposed reference product for all of the indications for which Botox is approved, other than the cosmetic uses (for which we do not hold development or commercialization rights).

 We held an initial meeting with the FDA in the third quarter of 2024 during which we aligned with the FDA on next steps to develop a Botox biosimilar. We anticipate commencing comparative analytic studies in the fourth quarter of 2024 and preparing for a potential Biosimilar Biological Product Development BPD meeting with the FDA in 2025 to review the results from the studies. Botulinum toxins have proven to be a highly versatile therapeutic biologic, with over 230 potential therapeutic uses documented in published scientific literature and twelve approved therapeutic indications in the United States. Our initial development programs for ABP-450 were directed at migraine, cervical dystonia and gastroparesis. We selected these initial programs based on a comprehensive product assessment screen designed to identify indications where we believe ABP-450 has the potential to deliver significant value to patients, physicians and payors and where its clinical, regulatory and commercial characteristics suggest viability. We believe that ABP-450 has potential across a broad range of target indications and we plan to continue to explore additional development programs that satisfy our product assessment screens. The FDA allowed our Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for ABP-450, supporting our clinical trials in the preventative treatment for migraine, to proceed in October 2020, and we began treating patients in our Phase 2 clinical study beginning in March 2021. Prior to commencing this Phase 2 study, no Phase 1 clinical studies of ABP-450 had been performed in regard to migraine by us or any other party. Nevertheless, given the extensive preclinical toxicology and other data developed by our licensing partner, Daewoong, and the aesthetic licensor of ABP-450, Evolus, the FDA permitted us to proceed directly to this Phase 2 clinical trial. The FDA allowed our IND for ABP-450, which supports our clinical trials in cervical dystonia, to proceed in October 2020, and we began treating patients in our Phase 2 clinical study beginning in April 2021. We enrolled 59 patients in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study across approximately 20 study sites in the United States. Patients enrolled into the study received one of four different injection cycles, low dose of 150 units, mid-dose of 250 units, high dose of 350 units or placebo, with patients evenly split among the four arms. Topline data from the Phase 2 cervical dystonia study, released in September 2022, showed that ABP-450 met all primary endpoints and a number of other key secondary endpoints, supporting the further development of ABP-450 in reducing signs and symptoms associated with cervical dystonia. We may commence a Phase 3 study in cervical dystonia pending availability of capital resources, the results of the comparative analytical studies and discussions with the FDA in a Biological Product Development meeting. We have never been profitable from operations and, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 433.7 million. We have never generated revenue from ABP-450. Losses from operations, excluding the impact of changes in fair value of the contingent consideration and write-off of IPR D, were 4.0 million, 22.2 million, 29.6 million, 2.6 million and 11.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) and the periods from January 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor), July 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor) and July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor), respectively. Consolidated net (loss) income were (6.2) million, 39.9 million, (60.7) million, (27.7) million and (297.7) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) and the periods from January 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor), July 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor) and July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor), respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had 0.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. We have concluded that we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations for 12 months from the date of our financial statements without additional financing, and as a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of the date of this Report, we have sufficient cash to fund our operating plan into the fourth quarter of 2024. Any further development of ABP-450 for any indication, including the biosimilar pathway and any additional studies in cervical dystonia, will require additional funding, which may not be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all . We do not expect to receive any revenue from ABP-450 or any future product candidates that we develop unless and until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize ABP-450 or any future product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing net operating losses for the foreseeable future as we seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization of ABP-450. We utilize clinical research organizations CROs ), to carry out our clinical development and we do not yet have a sales organization. We expect to incur significant expenses related to building our commercialization infrastructure, including marketing, sales and distribution functions, inventory build prior to commercial launch, training and deploying a specialty sales force and implementing a targeted marketing campaign.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources and Going Concern As disclosed further below in the section titled " Liquidity and Capital Resources ", we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. As of September 30, 2024 (Successor), we had reported cash and cash equivalents of 0.5 million and an accumulated deficit of 433.7 million. As a result of these conditions, management has concluded that substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists as conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements included in this Report are issued. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish our business plans and secure sources of financing and ultimately attain profitable operations. Description of the Merger, Forward Purchase Agreements and Convertible Note Subscription Merger At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), each outstanding share of Old AEON common stock (on an as-converted basis after taking into effect the conversion of the outstanding warrants of Old AEON exercisable for shares of Old AEON preferred stock, the conversion of the shares of Old AEON preferred stock into Old AEON common stock in accordance with the governing documents of Old AEON as of the Effective Time, the conversion of the outstanding convertible notes of Old AEON into Old AEON common stock in accordance with the terms of such convertible notes and after giving effect to the issuance of Old AEON common stock in connection with the merger of ABP Sub, Inc. with and into Old AEON) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time converted into the right to receive approximately 2.328 shares of our Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share common stock ). In addition, each share of Priveterra Class B common stock Founder Shares ), par value 0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time converted into one share of common stock (of which 3,450,000 Founder Shares are subject to certain vesting and forfeiture conditions). Forward Purchase Agreements In addition, Priveterra entered into separate Forward Purchase Agreements with each of ACM ARRT J LLC ACM ), and Polar Multi-Strategy Master Fund Polar ), on June 29, 2023, for an OTC Equity Prepaid Forward Transaction (each, a Forward Purchase Agreement and together, the Forward Purchase Agreements ). The Forward Purchase Agreements provided that each of Polar and ACM would separately be paid directly an aggregate cash amount (the Prepayment Amount ), which was equal to an aggregate of 66.7 million based on the product of (i) 6,275,000 shares of Priveterra Class A common stock (the Additional Shares and (ii) the redemption price per share of 10.63. In satisfaction of the Prepayment Amount, on July 21, 2023, 66.7 million was obligated to be paid from the purchase of the Additional Shares by each of ACM and Polar pursuant to the terms of certain FPA Funding Amount PIPE Subscription Agreements between Priveterra and each of ACM and Polar. On March 18, 2024, we entered into separate termination agreements with each of ACM and Polar terminating their respective Forward Purchase Agreements (each, an FPA Termination Agreement and together, the FPA Termination Agreements ). The FPA Termination Agreement with ACM provides that (i) ACM will retain 3,100,000 previously issued Additional Shares held by ACM pursuant to its respective Forward Purchase Agreement and subscription agreement (the ACM Retained Shares and (ii) we will be subject to up to 1.5 million in liquidated damages, subject to certain conditions set forth in ACM s respective FPA Termination Agreement. The Termination Agreement with Polar provides that (i) Polar will retain 3,175,000 previously issued Additional Shares held by Polar pursuant to its respective Forward Purchase Agreement and subscription agreement (the Polar Retained Shares and (ii) we will be subject to up to 1.5 million in liquidated damages, subject to certain conditions set forth in Polar s respective FPA Termination Agreement. The potential aggregate liquidated damages of up to 3.0 million was accrued as a liability in the first quarter of 2024. However, since each FPA provider elected to remove its respective shares from the registration statement, the Company released the liability in the second quarter of 2024. We did not have access to the Prepayment Amount at any time following the Closing and, pursuant to the FPA Termination Agreements, ACM and Polar will retain the Prepayment Amount in full. The terminated access to the Prepayment Amount may adversely affect our liquidity and capital needs. In connection with the negotiation of the Forward Purchase Agreements (and FPA Termination Agreements) and related subscription agreements, J.V.B. Financial Group, LLC, acting through its Cohen Company Capital Markets division CCM ),

 provided certain consulting services, initially to Priveterra and subsequently to AEON, pursuant to an engagement letter, by and between AEON and CCM, dated July 27, 2023 and amended July 1, 2024 (the CCM Engagement Letter ). On July 5, 2024, pursuant to the CCM Engagement Letter, we issued 400,000 shares of our common stock to CCM. Convertible Note Subscription On March 19, 2024, we entered into the Subscription Agreement with Daewoong relating to our sale and issuance of the Convertible Notes in the principal amount of up to 15.0 million, which are convertible into shares of common stock, subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in each Convertible Note. Each Convertible Note contains customary events of default, accrues interest at an annual rate of 15.79 and has a maturity date that is three years from the funding date (the Maturity Date ), unless earlier repurchased, converted or redeemed in accordance with its terms prior to such date. We will use the net proceeds from each Convertible Note to support the late-stage clinical development of ABP-450 and for general working capital purposes. Pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement, on March 24, 2024, we issued and sold to Daewoong one Convertible Note in the principal amount of 5.0 million and, on April 12, 2024, we issued and sold to Daewoong an additional Convertible Note in the principal amount of 10.0 million. On March 19, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to the License Agreement (the License Agreement Amendment with Daewoong, which amends that certain License and Supply Agreement, by and between us and Daewoong, dated December 20, 2019, as amended on July 29, 2022, January 8, 2023 and April 24, 2023 (the License Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement Amendment, the License Agreement will terminate if, over any six-month period, (a) we cease to commercialize ABP-450 in certain territories specified in the License Agreement and (b) we cease to advance any clinical studies of ABP-450 in such territories. The License Agreement Amendment also provides that, in the event that the License Agreement is terminated for the foregoing reasons, Daewoong will have the right to purchase all Know-How (as defined in the License Agreement) related to ABP-450 for a price of 1.00 (the Termination Purchase Right ). The Termination Purchase Right will terminate and expire upon Daewoong s sale of 50 of its common stock, including common stock held by its affiliates and common stock that would be issued upon an Automatic Conversion or Optional Conversion (as defined below). If, prior to the Maturity Date, the Company consummates a bona-fide third-party financing in the form of Common Stock or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, Common Stock (subject to certain exceptions as described in each Convertible Note), in one or more transactions or a series of related and substantially similar and simultaneous transactions at the same purchase price from third parties unaffiliated with Daewoong and its affiliates, for aggregate gross cash proceeds to the Company of at least 30.0 million (a Qualified Financing ), then, upon written notice thereof to Daewoong by the Company, on the closing date of such Qualified Financing, each Convertible Note will automatically convert in whole (the Automatic Conversion (subject to any limitations under the rules and regulations of NYSE American), without any further action by Daewoong, into a number of shares equal to: (i) one and three tenths (1.3) multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (a) the principal amount of each Convertible Note and all accrued and unpaid interest to be converted divided by (b) the per share price of the common stock sold in the Qualified Financing, provided that such per share price of common stock is at least 1.00 per share. If, prior to the Maturity Date, the Company provides (i) written notice to Daewoong that it has publicly announced topline clinical data regarding its Phase 3 clinical study of ABP-450 for the treatment of chronic or episodic migraine, and such data indicates achievement of all primary endpoints or (ii) a written notice that the Company has consummated a Change of Control (as defined in each Convertible Note), Daewoong will have the right for thirty (30) days following receipt of either such notice, at Daewoong s option (the Optional Conversion ), to convert all (but not less than all) of the remaining outstanding portion of each Convertible Note (subject to any limitations under the rules of NYSE American) into an amount of shares of common stock equal to: (i) one and three tenths (1.3) multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (a) the principal amount of each Convertible Note and all accrued and unpaid interest to be converted divided by (b) the volume weighted average trading per share price of common stock over the five (5) trading days prior to the Company s receipt of Daewoong s written notice of exercise of the Optional Conversion, provided that such per share price of common stock is at least 1.00 per share. As a result of becoming a public company, we will need to engage additional resources and/or hire additional staff and implement processes and procedures to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. We expect to incur additional annual expenses for, among other things, directors and officers liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting, legal and administrative resources and fees.

 Components of Our Results of Operations Revenue We have generated no revenue from the sale of products and do not anticipate deriving any product revenue unless and until we receive regulatory approval for, and are able to successfully commercialize, ABP-450. Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A expenses, consist primarily of compensation for personnel, including stock-based compensation, management, finance, legal, and regulatory functions. Other SG A expenses include travel expenses, market research and analysis, conferences and trade shows, professional services fees, including legal, audit and tax fees, insurance costs, general corporate expenses, and allocated facilities-related expenses. We anticipate that our SG A expenses will increase in the future to support our continued research and development R D ), activities. Additionally, we anticipate increased costs associated with being a public company, including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with the requirements of the NYSE American and the SEC, insurance, and investor relations costs. We expect to incur increased costs associated with establishing sales, marketing, and commercialization functions in advance of potential future regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product candidates. If ABP-450 obtains United States regulatory approval for any indication, we expect that we would incur significantly increased expenses associated with building a sales and marketing team and funding commercial activities. Research and Development Expenses Our R D expenses are primarily attributed to the development of ABP-450 for migraine, cervical dystonia and gastroparesis. Due to the stage of our development and our ability to use resources across all of our programs, most of our R D costs are not recorded on a program-specific basis. We expect our R D expenses to continue to increase as we, subject to raising additional capital, develop and initiate a Phase 3 study of ABP-450 in cervical dystonia and commence a Phase 2 study of ABP-450 for gastroparesis . R D expenses associated with these studies will include third-party costs such as expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, the cost of consultants who assist with the development of ABP-450 on a program-specific basis, investigator grants, sponsored research, product costs in connection with acquiring ABP-450 from Daewoong for use in conducting preclinical and clinical studies, and other third-party expenses attributable to the development of our product candidates. R D activities will be critical to achieving our business strategy. As our pipeline programs enter the later stages of clinical development, we will generally incur greater development costs than those programs incurred in the earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later- stage clinical studies. We expect our R D expenses to be significant over the next several years as we advance the clinical development of ABP-450 and prepare to seek regulatory approval. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our programs or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. Our R D activities may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our priorities and available resources. Acquired in-Process Research and Development The Company records costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses to research and development expense as acquired in-process research and development IPR D if the technology licensed has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. The acquired IPR D recorded at the Closing was written off to the Successor s consolidated statement of operations for the period ended September 30, 2023.

 Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The Company determined that the Contingent Consideration Shares would be classified as a liability on the Successor s condensed consolidated balance sheets and remeasured at each reporting period with changes to fair value recorded to the Successor s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. Other Loss, Net Other loss, net primarily consists of gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the fair value of our convertible notes, forward purchase agreements, warrant liabilities, each described below, at each balance sheet date. Change in fair value of convertible notes The Company elected the fair value option to account for its convertible notes, with the subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. Loss on embedded forward purchase agreement and make whole derivative - the Company has determined that each of its forward purchase agreements entered in connection with the Merger is a freestanding hybrid financial instrument comprising a subscription receivable and embedded features, which were bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative instruments. The Company recorded the derivatives as liabilities and measured them at fair value with the initial value of the derivative recorded as a loss on the line in the Successor s opening accumulated deficit. On the line describes those transactions triggered by the consummation of the Merger that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor or the Successor as they are not directly attributable to either period but instead were contingent on the Merger. Subsequent changes in the bifurcated derivatives are recorded in the Successor s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. Change in fair value of warrants - Changes in the estimated fair value of our warrant liabilities are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the Successor s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. Income Tax Our tax provision is comprised of federal and state income taxes. We currently record a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. We have provided for the tax effects of uncertain tax positions in our tax provision.

 Comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) and the periods from January 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor), July 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor) and July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor) Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative (SG A) Expenses SG A expenses were 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), a decrease of 3.3 million, or 52 , compared to 1.1 million and 5.3 million for the periods from July 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor) and July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor), respectively. The decrease in S GA expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease of 1.8 million in legal expenses and professional fees related to the Merger in the prior year and a decrease of 1.3 million related to stock-based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting and replacement award accounting in the prior year. SG A expenses were 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), a decrease of 4.1 million, or 27 , compared to 9.8 million and 5.3 million for the periods from January 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor) and July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor), respectively. The decrease in SG A expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease of 3.4 million in legal expenses and professional fees related to the Merger in the prior year and a decrease of 1.0 million related to stock-based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting and replacement award accounting in the prior year, offset by an increase of 0.5 million related to public company insurance for director and officers in the current year. Research and Development (R D) Expenses R D expenses were 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), a decrease of 7.0 million, or 88 , compared to 1.6 million and 6.4 million during the periods from July 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor) and July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor), respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 6.7 million decrease in R D expenses due to wind down of Phase 2 clinical trials related to chronic and episodic migraine and cervical dystonia, and a decrease of 0.3 million related to headcount reduction to preserve cash. R D expenses were 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), a decrease of 15.0 million, or 57 , compared to 19.8 million and 6.4 million during the periods from January 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor) and July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor), respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 15.1 million decrease in R D expenses due to wind down of Phase 2 clinical trials related to chronic and episodic migraine and cervical dystonia. Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration (Successor) The Company recognized a gain of 0, 97.5 million and 75.9 million related to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) and period from July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor), respectively, related to certain contingent provisions, restrictions and forfeiture provisions for Founder Shares and certain Participating Stockholders shares, which was primarily attributable to the change in probabilities of meeting milestones and fluctuations in stock price of the Company. See Note 6 Fair Value Measurements to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Other Loss, Net Other loss, net was 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), which is mainly attributable to loss on fair value of convertible notes of 1.9 million due to changes in stock price and conversion probabilities of the Daewoong convertible notes, and loss on fair value of warrants of 0.4 million due to changes in stock price, volatility and risk-free rate; compared to loss of 25.0 million for the period from July 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor), which is mainly attributed to change in fair value of Predecessor convertible notes of 13.2 million and loss on settlement of derivates of 11.8 million; and loss of 14.0 million for the period from July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor), which is mainly attributable to a loss of 15.8 million related to changes in fair value of forward purchase agreements and derivative liabilities, offset by a gain of 1.6 million related to changes in fair value of warrants.

 Other loss, net was a loss of 35.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), which is mainly attributable to a loss of 19.9 million on forward purchase agreements and derivative liabilities (Successor), mainly related to the termination of the forward purchase agreements of 20 million; loss of 15.4 million for change in fair value of warrants (Successor), mainly due to the decrease in the Company s stock price and a decrease in the number of warrants outstanding due to the cashless warrant exercises and redemption of public warrants in the first half of fiscal year 2024; compared to loss of 31.0 million for the period from January 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor), which is mainly attributed to change in fair value of Predecessor convertible notes of 19.4 million and loss on settlement of derivates of 11.8 million; and loss of 14.0 million for the period from July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor), which is mainly attributable to a loss of 15.8 million related to changes in fair value of forward purchase agreements and derivative liabilities, offset by a gain of 1.6 million related to changes in fair value of warrants. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of capital have been debt financing (Predecessor) and equity financing (Successor). We have experienced recurring losses from operations and have a net capital deficiency and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of September 30, 2024 (Successor), we had reported cash and cash equivalents of 0.5 million and an accumulated deficit of 433.7 million. On May 3, 2024, we announced preliminary top-line results from its planned interim analysis of the Phase 2 trial with ABP-450 in the preventative treatment of chronic migraine, which did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints. We originally intended to pursue submission of an Original BLA seeking one or more potential therapeutic indications for ABP-450. However, in May 2024, we announced the discontinuation of our Phase 2 clinical trials for episodic and chronic migraine in order to implement certain cash preservation measures. On July 9, 2024, we announced a strategic reprioritization to pursue a 351(k) biosimilar regulatory pathway for ABP-450, using AbbVie Inc. s product Botox as a proposed reference product for all of the indications for which Botox is approved, other than the cosmetic uses. We are continuing to evaluate other cash preservation measures and will review all strategic options. Prior to the Merger, Priveterra had entered into separate Forward Purchase Agreements with each of ACM and Polar. The Forward Purchase Agreements provided that each of Polar and ACM would separately be paid directly the Prepayment Amount, which was equal to an aggregate of 66.7 million based on the product of (i) 6,275,000 Additional Shares and (ii) the redemption price per share of 10.63. In satisfaction of the Prepayment Amount, on July 21, 2023, 66.7 million was obligated to be paid from the purchase of the Additional Shares by each of ACM and Polar pursuant to the terms of certain FPA Funding Amount PIPE Subscription Agreements between Priveterra and each of ACM and Polar. On March 18, 2024, we entered into separate FPA Termination Agreements with each of ACM and Polar terminating their respective Forward Purchase Agreements. The FPA Termination Agreement with ACM provides that (i) ACM will retain 3,100,000 previously issued Additional Shares held by ACM pursuant to its respective Forward Purchase Agreement and subscription agreement and (ii) we will be subject to up to 1.5 million in liquidated damages, subject to certain conditions set forth in ACM s respective FPA Termination Agreement. The Termination Agreement with Polar provides that (i) Polar will retain 3,175,000 previously issued Additional Shares held by Polar pursuant to its respective Forward Purchase Agreement and subscription agreement and (ii) we will be subject to up to 1.5 million in liquidated damages, subject to certain conditions set forth in Polar s respective FPA Termination Agreement. We did not have access to the Prepayment Amount at any time following the Closing and, pursuant to the FPA Termination Agreements, ACM and Polar will retain the Prepayment Amount in full. The potential aggregate liquidated damages of up to 3.0 million was accrued as a liability in the first quarter of 2024. However, since each FPA provider elected to remove its respective shares from the registration statement, the Company released the liability in the second quarter of 2024. The terminated access to the Prepayment Amount may adversely affect our liquidity and capital needs. On March 19, 2024, we entered into the Subscription Agreement with Daewoong relating to our sale and issuance of Convertible Notes in the principal amount of up to 15.0 million, which are convertible into shares of common stock, subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in each Convertible Note. Each Convertible Note will contain customary events of default, will accrue interest at an annual rate of 15.79 and will have a maturity date that is three years from the funding date, unless earlier repurchased, converted or redeemed in accordance with its terms prior to such date. We will use the net proceeds from each Convertible Note to support the late-stage clinical development of ABP-450 and for general working capital purposes. Pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement, on March 24, 2024, we issued and sold to Daewoong one Convertible Note in the principal amount of 5.0 million. The Subscription Agreement further provides that we will issue and sell to Daewoong a second Convertible Note in the 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 principal amount of 10.0 million no later than thirty (30) days following our compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Subscription Agreement, including our execution of an amendment to the License Agreement with Daewoong. On March 19, 2024, we entered into the License Agreement Amendment with Daewoong, which amends the License Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement Amendment, the License Agreement will terminate if, over any six-month period, (a) we cease to commercialize ABP-450 in certain territories specified in the License Agreement and (b) we cease to advance any clinical studies of ABP-450 in such territories. The License Agreement Amendment also provides that, in the event that the License Agreement is terminated for the foregoing reasons, Daewoong will have the right to purchase all Know- How (as defined in the License Agreement) related to ABP-450 for a price of 1.00. The Termination Purchase Right will terminate and expire upon Daewoong s sale of 50 of its common stock, including common stock held by its affiliates and common stock that would be issued upon an Automatic Conversion or Optional Conversion (as defined in the Convertible Notes). On July 9, 2024, we announced a strategic reprioritization to pursue a Section 351(k) biosimilar regulatory pathway for ABP-450, using AbbVie Inc. s product Botox as a proposed reference product. We held an initial meeting with the FDA in the third quarter of 2024 during which we aligned with the FDA on next steps to develop a Botox biosimilar. We anticipate commencing comparative analytic studies in the fourth quarter of 2024 and preparing for a potential Biosimilar Biological Product Development BPD meeting with the FDA in 2025 to review the results from the studies. However, the commencement of studies, preparation for the potential BPD meeting and any further development of ABP-450 would require additional funding in the form of equity financings or debt. There can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that, in the event that they are successful, the terms and conditions of such financing will be commercially acceptable. Furthermore, the use of equity as a source of financing would dilute existing shareholders. As of the date of this Report, we expect to have sufficient cash to fund our operating plan into the fourth quarter of 2024. We are actively attempting to secure additional capital to fund our operations. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist of R D expenditures, including clinical trials, as well as SG A expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay or prepay these expenses. We expect to continue to incur substantial costs in order to conduct R D activities necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue from sales of ABP-450, we will need additional capital to undertake these activities and commercialization efforts, and, therefore, we intend to raise such capital through the issuance of additional equity, borrowings, and potentially strategic alliances with other companies. However, if such financing is not available at adequate levels or on acceptable terms, we could be required to reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our development programs or commercialization efforts, out-license intellectual property rights to our product candidates or sell unsecured assets, or a combination of the above, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or our ability to fund our scheduled obligations on a timely basis or at all. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish these plans and secure sources of financing and ultimately attain profitable operations. We may also seek to raise additional capital through the sale of public or private equity or convertible debt securities. If we incur additional debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. If we undertake discretionary financing by issuing equity securities or convertible debt securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by current public stockholders. If we sell common stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in more than one transaction, stockholders may be further diluted by subsequent sales. Additionally, future equity financings may result in new investors receiving rights superior to our existing stockholders. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our common stock and diluting their interests. We may receive additional capital from the cash exercise of the Private Placement Warrants. However, the exercise price of our Private Placement Warrants is 11.50 per warrant and the last reported sales price of our common stock on November 11, 2024 was 

 39 

Table of Contents 
 0.82. The likelihood that holders of the Private Placement Warrants will exercise their Private Placement Warrants, and therefore the likelihood of any amount of cash proceeds that we may receive, is dependent upon the trading price of our common stock after effectiveness of the registration statement related thereto registering the issuance of common stock underlying the Private Placement Warrants. If the trading price for our common stock does not maintain a price above 11.50 per share, we do not expect holders to exercise their Warrants for cash. We will have broad discretion over the use of any proceeds from the exercise of such securities. Any proceeds from the exercise of such securities would increase our liquidity, but we are not currently budgeting for any cash proceeds from the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants when planning for our operational funding needs. The Private Placement Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis at any time and we will not receive any proceeds from such exercise, even if the Private Placement Warrants are in-the-money. To the extent that we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs or product licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If these sources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we will seek to raise additional funds through future equity or debt financings. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. There can be no assurance that our efforts to procure additional financing will be successful or that, if they are successful, the terms and conditions of such financing will be favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional financing when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate the development, commercialization and marketing of our products and scale back our business and operations. As a result of these conditions, management has concluded that substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists as conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements included in this Report are issued. Our financial information throughout this Report and our financial statements included elsewhere in this Report have been prepared on a basis that assumes that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. This financial information and our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from an unfavorable outcome of this uncertainty. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish our business plans and secure sources of financing and ultimately attain profitable operations. Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) was 19.7 million, consisting primarily of a net income of 39.9 million (Successor) and non-cash charges of (57.0) million, consisting primarily of 4.9 million non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation for our executives and directors (Successor), 0.2 million related to the change in fair value of the convertible notes (Successor), 15.4 million related to change in fair value of warrants (Successor), 19.9 million related to loss on forward purchase agreement and derivative liabilities (Successor) and (97.5) million related to change in fair value of contingent consideration (Successor). Net cash used in operating activities for the periods from January 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor) and July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor) were 21.7 million and 15.1 million, respectively, consisting primarily of net losses of 60.7 million and 297.7 million, respectively, and non-cash items of 34.4 million and 288.4 million, respectively, consisting of 3.2 million non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation for our executives and directors (Predecessor), 19.4 million related to the change in fair value of the convertible notes (Predecessor) and 11.8 million related to loss on forward purchase agreement and derivative liabilities (Successor); and consisting of 2.2 million non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation for our executives and directors (Successor), 348.0 million related to write-off of acquired IPR D, (1.6) million related to change in fair value of warrants (Successor), 15.8 million related to loss on forward purchase agreement and derivative liabilities (Successor) and (75.9) million related to change in fair value of contingent consideration (Successor). Cash Flows from Investing Activities There was no cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) and the periods from January 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor) and July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor).

 Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) and the periods from January 1, 2023 to July 21, 2023 (Predecessor) and July 22, 2023 to September 30, 2023 (Successor) were 15.1 million, 14.0 million and 0, respectively, primarily related to the issuance of convertible notes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses at the date of the financial statements as well as the expenses incurred during the reporting period. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions in accordance with United States GAAP that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material to the financial position and results of operations. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no changes to our critical accounting policies from those reported on our Annual Report Form 10-K. JOBS Act; Smaller Reporting Company We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including not being required to have our internal control over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In particular, in this Report, we have provided only two years of audited financial statements and unaudited financial statements and have not included all of the executive compensation- related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act allows us to delay adoption of the new or revised accounting standards until those standards apply to non-public business entities. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of Priveterra s initial public offering (December 31, 2026), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year, or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. We are also a smaller reporting company, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, meaning that the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates plus the proposed aggregate amount of gross proceeds to us as a result of this offering is less than 700 million and our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We will continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. Investors could find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the trading price may be more volatile .

 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements We describe the recently issued accounting pronouncements that apply to us in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information under this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specific in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Per Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to inherent limitations of internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our Chief Executive Officer certifying officer ), in his role as Principal Executive and Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of September 30, 2024. Our certifying officer concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. Our certifying officer concluded that the Company did not have an effective risk assessment over complex transactions due to the lack of sufficient and qualified resources. This also led to a deficiency in the design and implementation of controls over in-process research and development and valuation of financial instruments. The material weaknesses resulted in a restatement of our financial statements as described in the Explanatory Note to the Quarterly Report Form 10Q/A for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 filed on March 29, 2024 and the Explanatory Note to the Annual Report Form 10K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on May 14, 2024. Furthermore, the control deficiencies described above created a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Additionally, as previously disclosed, on July 21, 2023, AEON completed a Merger with Old AEON and Merger Sub, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Old AEON, with Old AEON surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEON. Prior to the Merger, Priveterra was a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock 

 42 

Table of Contents 
 exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. As a result, previously existing internal controls are no longer applicable or comprehensive enough as of the assessment date considering the Company s operations prior to the Merger were insignificant compared to those of the Post-Combination Company. The design and implementation of internal controls over financial reporting for the Post-Combination Company has required and will continue to require significant time and resources from management and other personnel. Based on our assessment, we have continued to identify a material weakness in connection with Priveterra s internal controls around the interpretation and accounting for extinguishment of a significant contingent obligation as of December 31, 2022 that were not effectively designed or maintained. Remediation Status of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We plan to enhance our processes by designing and implementing controls to review the results of valuations and estimates, including the completeness and accuracy of relevant data elements included in the valuation or estimate. We also plan to engage additional qualified resources and/or hire additional staff to ensure these incremental controls are properly implemented. Management continues to be actively engaged to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses, including transition of financial reporting responsibilities from Priveterra to AEON and enhanced processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our consolidated financial statements, providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents, and increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management has continued to take action to remediate the material weaknesses during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. However, the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until management designs and implements effective controls that operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. Other than described above, there has not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter to which this Report relates that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings On September 18, 2023, Odeon Capital Group LLC Odeon filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, alleging that the Company failed to pay Odeon s deferred underwriting fee of 1.25 million. Odeon claims that it served as the underwriter for Priveterra Acquisition Corp., the special purpose acquisition company with which Old AEON merged with and into in July 2023. Odeon seeks monetary damages for the full amount of its claimed underwriting fee, punitive damages, attorneys fees and other amounts. On November 16, 2023, the Company filed a successful motion to dismiss certain claims included in Odeon s complaint. Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to other information contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 12, 2024, or the Q2 Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results.
