revenues and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the remainder of 2024. Although the Company projects operating revenue to be derived from the operation of clinical facilities through its HOPE subsidiary and sales of its pharmaceutical products in 2025, these projections are subject to completion of anticipated clinical acquisitions in the first case and regulatory approvals in the latter case. In the absence of these projected developments, the Company s ability to support its ongoing capital needs is dependent on its ability to continue to raise equity and/or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, in order to continue operations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had million in cash and cash equivalents. On August 12, 2024, the Company entered into that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated August 12, 2024 the Purchase Agreement with certain accredited investors (the Investors ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes (the Anson Notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to approximately million in tranches of million, and warrants to purchase that amount of shares of the Company s Common Stock equal to 50 of the principal amount of the Notes in the respective tranche divided by the volume weighted average price VWAP of the Company s Common Stock, as listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, on the day prior to the closing of each respective tranche under the Purchase Agreement (the Anson Warrants ). The Company consummated the sale of the first tranche of million million in net proceeds) in Notes and Warrants (the First Closing on August 14, 2024 the First Closing Date ), and the second tranche of million in Notes and Warrants (the Second Closing on October 10, 2024 the Second Closing Date ), for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million, before deducting fees, costs, and other expenses. 
 
 The Company has secured operating capital that it anticipates as sufficient to fund its drug development operations through year end and to finance submission of FDA New Drug Applications for NRX- 100 and NRX- 101. The Company may pursue additional equity or debt financing or refinancing opportunities in 2024 and 2025 to fund ongoing clinical activities, to meet obligations under its current debt arrangements and for general corporate purposes. Such arrangements may take the form of loans, equity offerings, strategic agreements, licensing agreements, joint ventures or other agreements. The sale of equity could result in additional dilution to the Company s existing shareholders. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms, or that it will be able to refinance its existing debt obligations which could negatively impact the Company s business and operations and could also lead to a reduction in the Company s operations. The Company will continue to carefully monitor the impact of its continuing operations on the Company s working capital needs and debt repayment obligations. As such, the Company has concluded that substantial doubt exists regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

par value Common Stock ), at a ratio of 1 -for- . All historical share amounts, with the exception of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock, disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, as fractional shares of Common Stock were rounded up to the nearest whole share. See Note 9. Equity for additional information. 

The accounting guidance classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.

million. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash. The Company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalent balances in the form of a money market account with a financial institution that management believes to be creditworthy. 

The License Agreement (the License Agreement with Alvogen Pharma US, Inc., Alvogen, Inc. and Lotus Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (collectively, Alvogen (as further discussed in Note 6 below) was accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, it performs the following five steps: i. identify the contract(s) with a customer ii. identify the performance obligations in the contract iii. determine the transaction price iv. allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations within the contract and v. recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five -step model to contracts when it determines that it is probable it will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within the contract to determine whether each promised good or service is a performance obligation. The promised goods or services in the Company s arrangements typically consist of a license to intellectual property and research services. The Company may provide options to additional items in such arrangements, which are accounted for as separate contracts when the customer elects to exercise such options, unless the option provides a material right to the customer. Performance obligations are promises in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer that (i) the customer can benefit from on its own or together with other readily available resources, and (ii) is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Goods or services that are not individually distinct performance obligations are combined with other promised goods or services until such combined group of promises meet the requirements of a performance obligation. The Company determines transaction price based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. Consideration may be fixed, variable, or a combination of both. At contract inception for arrangements that include variable consideration, the Company estimates the probability and extent of consideration it expects to receive under the contract utilizing either the most likely amount method or expected amount method, whichever best estimates the amount expected to be received. The Company then considers any constraints on the variable consideration and includes in the transaction price variable consideration to the extent it is deemed probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price and recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) control is transferred to the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied. For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The Company records amounts as accounts receivable when the right to consideration is deemed unconditional. When consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded as deferred revenue. The Company s revenue arrangements may include the following: Milestone Payments : At the inception of an agreement that includes milestone payments, the Company evaluates each milestone to determine when and how much of the milestone to include in the transaction price. The Company first estimates the amount of the milestone payment that the Company could receive using either the expected value or the most likely amount approach. The Company primarily uses the most likely amount approach as that approach is generally most predictive for milestone payments with a binary outcome. Then, the Company considers whether any portion of that estimated amount is subject to the variable consideration constraint (that is, whether it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty.) The Company updates the estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price at each reporting date which includes updating the assessment of the likely amount of consideration and the application of the constraint to reflect current facts and circumstances. 
 Royalties : For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company will recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Research Services : The Company incurred research costs in association with the License Agreement. After the First Milestone Payment (as defined in Note 6 below), the Company would have been reimbursed for certain costs incurred related to reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs for clinical and non-clinical development activities. The Company would have recognized revenue for the reimbursed costs when the First Milestone Payment contingencies had been achieved and the Company had an enforceable claim to the reimbursed costs.

million upon the later of a positive data read-out from the Company s ongoing Phase 2b/3 clinical trial and completion of the Type B meeting with the FDA (the First Milestone Payment ). In February 2024, the parties executed an amendment accelerating payment of up to million related to the First Milestone Payment, with the remaining million due upon the original agreement s terms (see below for advances received through September 30, 2024 ). As compensation for advancing the milestone, Alvogen received warrants to purchase up to shares of the Company's Common Stock, at a strike price of with a three year term (See Note 9 ). The grant date fair value of the warrants was approximately million, which the Company planned to account for as consideration paid to a customer (see below). The second portion of the first milestone was to be million and, as before, triggered by a positive response to the Company's planned end of phase 2 meeting with FDA. If the first milestone was not achieved by September 3, 2024, the Company would have been obligated to repay any amount received against the million advance of the First Milestone Payment to Alvogen. As there was significant uncertainty relative to approval of any drug candidate in development, the Company concluded that it was not probable that a significant reversal of revenue would not occur if the Company were to include the First Milestone Payment, or any advances thereof, in the transaction price prior to receiving FDA approval. Accordingly, the transaction price was fully constrained and advances from Alvogen were recorded as a refund liability until such time as the refund right expired. Further, the Company accounted for the warrants issued to Alvogen within additional paid-in capital consistent with the accounting for unfunded stock subscription agreements until such time as the uncertainty around the First Milestone was resolved. 
 
 Termination 
 
 Under the License Agreement, as amended, Alvogen was granted early termination rights. On June 21, 2024, the Company received a notice of termination from Alvogen effective immediately. Following the termination of the License Agreement by Alvogen, the amounts advanced pursuant to the amendment became due and payable to Alvogen. Accordingly, the refund liability has not been reclassified as deferred revenue or recorded as revenue as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Upon termination of the License Agreement, the intellectual property rights licensed to Alvogen under the License Agreement reverted to the Company, and all other rights and obligations of each of the parties immediately ceased, except for outstanding amounts owed as of the time of such expiration or termination. As of September 30, 2024, the refund liability due to Alvogen was million, which represents all payments made by Alvogen through September 30, 2024, and is included as a component of accrued expense and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet (refer to Note 5 ). Following the early termination by Alvogen, the Company does not anticipate recognizing any revenue under the License Agreement. Additionally, in June 2024 the Company wrote-off the unfunded stock subscription receivable of million related to the warrants previously classified in additional paid-in capital to research and development expense following the termination. 

redeemable promissory note (as amended, the Streeterville Note to Streeterville Capital, LLC, a Utah limited liability company Streeterville ), for an aggregate principal amount of million. The Streeterville Note originally matured months from the date of issuance subject to certain acceleration provisions. The Streeterville Note carried an original issue discount of million which was deducted from the principal balance of the Streeterville Note. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Streeterville Note was million after transaction costs including the original issue discount, legal and other fees are included. 
 
 The initial terms of the Streeterville Note included the following provisions, certain of which were subsequently modified, as described below. The Company had the option to prepay the Streeterville Note during the term by paying an amount equal to of the principal, interest, and fees owed as of the prepayment date. The noteholder had the right to redeem up to million of the outstanding balance of the Streeterville Note per month starting six months after the issuance date (the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount ). Payments could be made by the Company at their option in: (i) in cash with a premium (the Redemption Premium for the amount redeemed, (ii) by paying the redemption amount in the form of shares of Common Stock with the number of redemption shares being equal to the portion of the applicable redemption amount divided by the Redemption Conversion Price (as defined below), or (iii) a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock. The Redemption Conversion Price on any given redemption date equaled multiplied by the average of the two lowest daily volume weighted average prices per share of the Common Stock during the ten trading days immediately preceding the date that the noteholder delivered notice electing to redeem a portion of the Streeterville Note. Beginning May 1, 2023, in the event (a) the daily dollar trading volume of the Common Stock of the Company on any given trading day was at least fifty percent 50 greater than the lower of (i) the median daily dollar trading volume over the previous ten 10 trading days or (ii) the daily dollar trading volume on the trading day immediately preceding the date of measurement or (b) if the closing trade price on any given trading day was at least thirty percent 30 greater than the Nasdaq Minimum Price, then the lender would be entitled to redeem over the following ten 10 trading days an amount of indebtedness then outstanding under the Streeterville Note equal to twice the monthly redemption amount of million solely by payment by stock, if permitted under the agreement, subject to the Maximum Percentage (as defined in the Streeterville Note) and other ownership limitations. 
 
 The Streeterville Note contained certain Trigger Events (as defined in the Streeterville Note) that generally, if uncured within five trading days, could result in an event of default in accordance with the terms of the Streeterville Note (such event, an Event of Default ). Upon an Event of a Default, the Lender could consider the Streeterville Note immediately due and payable. Upon an Event of Default, the interest rate could also be increased to the lesser of per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law (see below). 
 
 Due to these embedded features within the Streeterville Note, the Company elected to account for the Streeterville Note at fair value at inception. Subsequent changes in fair value were recorded as a component of other income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Convertible Note Amendments 
 
 On March 30, 2023, the Company entered into an Amendment to the Note (the First Amendment ), pursuant to which the Maximum Percentage was set at of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on a given date. 
 
 On July 7, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment #2 to the Streeterville Note with Streeterville (the Second Amendment ). Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company agreed to amend the redemption provisions of the Streeterville Note to provide that the Company would pay to Streeterville an amount in cash equal to million on or before July 10, 2023, which amount was paid on July 10, 2023.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Streeterville could also submit a request for redemption of up to an aggregate of million per month in accordance with the terms of the Second Amendment. However, the portion of each payment that was not satisfied by the delivery of Redemption Conversion Shares was the maximum amount of cash the Company would have been required to pay in accordance with the Second Amendment during the period from July 31, 2023 and on or before the last day of each month until December 31, 2023. The redemption of the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount in excess of the Minimum Amount would be satisfied by the delivery of additional Redemption Conversion Shares. 

On February 9, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment #3 to the Streeterville Note (the Third Amendment ), with Streeterville. In accordance with the Third Amendment, the Company and Streeterville agreed to amend the redemption provisions of the Streeterville Note to provide that the Company would pay to Streeterville an amount in cash equal to million on February 12, 2024, which the amount was paid on February 12, 2024.

 After April 30, 2024, and for the remainder of the payment period through July 31, 2024, Streeterville could redeem any Redemption Amount (as defined in the Streeterville Note), including an amount in excess of the Minimum Payment, subject to the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount. During the period through July 31, 2024, the Company was permitted to pay the Redemption Amounts by delivery of the Redemption Conversion Shares (as defined below) without regard to the existence of any Equity Conditions Failure, to the extent Streeterville submits redemption notices during such month pursuant to the terms of the Streeterville Note, and only for the Redemption Amounts covered by such notices.

The modification did not result in recognition of a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations as the modifications were not considered debt extinguishments, but impacted interest expense recognized in subsequent periods, prior to the settlement of the Streeterville Note. 
 
 Convertible Note Fair Value Measurements 
 
 The Company estimated the fair value of the Streeterville Note using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which used as inputs the fair value of its Common Stock and estimated for the equity volatility and volume volatility of its Common Stock, the time to expiration of the Streeterville Note, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximated the time to expiration, and probability of default. Therefore, the Company estimated its expected future volatility based on the actual volatility of its Common Stock and historical volatility of its Common Stock utilizing a lookback period consistent with the time to expiration. The time to expiration was based on the contractual maturity date, giving consideration to the mandatory and potential accelerated redemptions beginning six months from the issuance date. The risk-free interest rate was determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to the time to expiration. Probability of default was estimated using either Bloomberg's Default Risk function, which uses its financial information to calculate a default risk specific to the Company, or management's estimates which included, the Company's current cash runway, current efforts to raise financing, and current economic environment. 
 
 The discount to the principal amount was included in the carrying value of the Streeterville Note. During 2022, the Company recorded a debt discount of approximately million upon issuance of the Streeterville Note for the original issue discount of million. As a result of electing the fair value option, any direct costs and fees related to the Streeterville Note were expensed as incurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gain from the change in fair value of the Streeterville Note of million and million, respectively, which was recognized in other (income) expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a result of the Company s election of the fair value option. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a loss from the change in fair value of the Streeterville Note of million and million, respectively, which was recognized in other (income) expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a result of the Company s election of the fair value option. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company made cash payments for coupon interest on the Streeterville Note of approximately million and million, respectively, million in cash of redemption premiums, made cash principal repayments of million and million, respectively, issued shares of Common Stock as coupon interest repayment of million, issued shares of Common Stock as principal repayment of million, and incurred a default penalty of million.

 The Company evaluated the terms of the Settlement Amendment in accordance with ASC 470 - 50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments . Both the Settlement Amendment and the Third Amendment (considered cumulatively with the Settlement Amendment) were deemed to be debt modifications and did not give rise to a debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC Topic 470, Debt , which will be accounted for prospectively. The modifications did not result in recognition of a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations as the modifications were not considered debt extinguishments, but will impact interest expense and the determination of fair value in future periods.

Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other income (loss) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Additionally the portion of changes in the fair value related to changes in credit risk are recorded to other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of operations.

 Anson Warrants 
 
 The Anson Warrants, originally issued in the Purchase Agreement, are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815. The Company concluded liability classification was appropriate as certain settlement features included in the Anson Warrants are not indexed to the Company's own stock, and therefore preclude equity classification. Accordingly, the Company recognizes the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercise or expiration, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Anson Warrants were initially measured at fair value using a Black-Scholes model and have subsequently been measured based on the listed market price of such warrants. Warrant liabilities are classified as current liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. On August 14, 2024, in conjunction with the issuance of the First Tranche Notes, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to shares of the Company s Common Stock which were classified as a liability. The warrants have an exercise price of per share and have a contractual term of five years expiring on August 14, 2029. The measurement of fair value of the Investor Warrants were determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of , exercise price of , term of five years, volatility of , and risk-free rate of , and expected dividend rate of ). The grant date fair value of these Investor Warrants was estimated to be million on August 14, 2024. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of the Anson Warrants was million. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities.

 In connection with the Merger, each option of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share, based on the Exchange Ratio (of 0.316:1 ). 
 
 Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx stock options became options to purchase an aggregate shares of the Company s Common Stock at an average exercise price of per share. 
 
 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the Company s 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan ). As of January 1, 2024 , shares were added to the 2021 Plan under an evergreen feature that automatically increases the reserve with additional shares of Common Stock for future issuance under the Incentive Plan each calendar year, beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2031, equal to the lesser of (A) of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year or (B) a smaller number of shares determined by the Board. On December 28, 2023 the first amendment to the 2021 Omnibus Plan was executed which increased the maximum number of shares (i) available for issuance under the Plan, by an additional shares, and (ii) that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan to be equal to 100 of the Share Pool. As of September 30, 2024 , an aggregate shares have been awarded net of forfeitures, and shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based awards or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. 
 
 Option Awards 
 
 The fair value of each employee and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company is a public company and has limited company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the limited company-specific historical volatility and implied volatility. The expected term of the Company s stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the simplified method for awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain options granted contain terms that require all unvested options to immediately vest a) upon the approval of an NDA by the FDA for NRX 101, or b) immediately preceding a change in control of the Company, whichever occurs first. 
 
 The Company issued stock options during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

On July 12, 2022, the Board granted an award of restricted shares of the Company RSAs as an inducement to the newly appointed CEO, pursuant to a separate Restricted Stock Award Agreement. The RSAs will vest in approximately equal installments over three ) years from the grant date, subject to continued service through the applicable vesting date. 
 
 On December 28, 2023, the Company was authorized to grant RSAs to a consultant for services provided. The RSAs vested after six months from September 4, 2023, the date the services began. The shares were valued on the grant date based on the quoted price of or approximately million which was amortized over the vesting term. 
 
 Stock-based compensation expense related to RSAs was less than million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 respectively. 
 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company's CEO announced his resignation and as a result, all unvested RSAs were forfeited. Accordingly, the Company does not expect to recognize any further stock-based compensation expense for the balance of unvested RSAs as of September 30, 2024.

Warrant Liabilities 
 
 The Company utilizes a Black-Scholes model approach to value its liability-classified warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities is determined using Level 3 inputs. There were no transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy during the periods presented. Inherent in a Black Scholes options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its Common Stock based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero -coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero. 
 
 The weighted-average significant inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to measure the warrant liabilities that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

All references to Note, followed by a number reference from 1 to 14 herein, refer to the applicable corresponding numbered footnotes to these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Overview 
 
 NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: NRXP) NRX or the Company is a clinical-stage bio-pharmaceutical company which develops and will distribute, through its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, NeuroRx, Inc., NeuroRx and HOPE Therapeutics, Inc. HOPE ), novel therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system disorders including suicidal depression, chronic pain, and post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD and now schizophrenia. All of our current drug development activities are focused drugs that modulate on the N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA receptor in the brain and nervous system, a neurochemical pathway that has been disclosed in detail in our annual filings. NeuroRx is organized as a traditional research and development (" R D ") company, whereas HOPE is organized as a specialty pharmaceutical company intended to distribute ketamine and other therapeutic options to clinics that serve patients with suicidal depression and PTSD. The Company has two lead drug candidates that are expected to be submitted by year end for Food and Drug Administration (" FDA ") approval with anticipated FDA decision dates under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act PDUFA by the end of June 2025: NRX-101, an oral fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine and lurasidone and NRX-100, a preservative-free formulation of ketamine for intravenous infusion. In February 2024, the Company incorporated HOPE as a wholly-owned subsidiary and in August 2024 completed an audit of HOPE's financial statements necessary for the intended Spin-Off (as defined in above) of HOPE to the Company's shareholders at a future date. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024 and in the subsequent period, the Company has achieved the following: 

We consummated a financing agreement with an institutional investors for up to 16.3 million in debt capital, sufficient to finance the submission of New Drug Applications for NRX-100 and NRX-101. 

We settled litigation with Streeterville Capital, LLC at a substantial discount to the amounts claimed, thereby clearing the path to proposed partial spin-off of HOPE, our wholly-owned subsidiary, to our shareholders. 

We recorded positive data from a Phase 2b/3 trial of NRX-101 in Suicidal Bipolar Depression, demonstrating significant reduction of akathisia (P=0.025) and significant improvement in time to resolution of suicidality (P 

The above findings of reduced suicidality and akathisia confirm the results of the Company s prior STABIL-B trial in acutely suicidal patients and also mirror the results of an independent published trial; 

The Company plans to file a New Drug Application NDA in Q4 2024 for Accelerated Approval under Breakthrough and Priority Review of NRX-101 in treatment of bipolar depression in people at risk of akathisia, based on the Phase 2b/3 and STABIL-B data. Three manufacturing lots are now completed with more than 12 months of room temperature shelf-stability. The anticipated PDUFA date for this application is prior to June 30, 2025; 

The Company additionally plans to file an NDA in Q4 2024 for Approval under Fast Track Designation and Priority Review for NRX-100 (preservative-free sterile ketamine) in a tamper-resistant, diversion resistant packaging presentation. Ketamine efficacy data are in hand from 4 clinical trials. Three manufacturing lots are now completed with 9 months of stability anticipated by October 30, 2024. The anticipated PDUFA date for this settlement is prior to June 30, 2025. The Company believed that the preservative-free feature of this presentation will be deemed of benefit to patients because of the known toxicity of benzanthonium choloride used to preserve the current commercial formulations of ketamine used for anesthesia 

We developed a novel, patentable pH neutral formulation for ketamine (designed as HTX-100) that will be suitable for both intravenous and subcutaneous administration. Initial laboratory lots demonstrate shelf stability and ongoing stability is being assessed. Ketamine in its current commercial presentations cannot be administered subcutaneously because of its high acidic (pH 3.5-4.0) properties, an acidity range that is known to cause paid and skin ulcers; 

We have completed the audit for HOPE, thereby facilitating the proposed Spin-Off. We have partnered with representatives of ketamine clinic operators to construct a care platform that will include ketamine, operational support, and digital therapeutic extensions. In advance of FDA approval, HOPE is supplying ketamine under 503b pharmacy licensure to meet the national ketamine shortage declared by FDA; 

Signed non-binding letters of intent to acquire two precision psychiatry centers for HOPE Therapeutics for which we are in the process of due diligence. Entered into negotiation with four additional precision psychiatry centers with the intention of assembling a network delivering 25 million or more in ketamine-based precision psychiatric treatment for suicidal depression by year-end 2024. 

NRX-101 in the treatment of Complicated Urinary Tract Infection cUTI granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product QIDP ), Fast Track, and Priority Review designations. Company has now demonstrated that NRX-101 does not damage the microbiome of the gut, in contrast to all other advanced antibiotics and is less likely to cause C. Difficile infection (a potentially lethal side effect of antibiotic treatment). NRx is reviewing partnership options: and 

Executed Memorandum of Understanding with Foundation FundaMental for rights to develop potential disease modifying drug for schizophrenia. If successful, this would represent the first drug to reverse the underlying disease mechanism of schizophrenia, rather than simply treating symptoms.

Development of NRX-101 for Suicidal Treatment-Resistant Suicidal Bipolar Depression 
 
 On May 5, 2024, the Company announced final data from the recently completed phase 2b/3 trial of NRX-101 in suicidal bipolar depression, with a significantly improved safety profile as demonstrated by a statistically significant reduction in akathisia, an adverse event considered by many experts to be a precursor to suicide. Given the vital need for safer medications in this at-risk population, we plan to submit an NDA to the US FDA for treatment of bipolar depression patients at risk of akathisia, based on these data as well as additional data from our STABIL-B trial. 

Trial participants had identical mean scores on the BARS at baseline with subsequent decrease in the NRX-101 treated group versus an increase in the lurasidone-treated group, yielding a 76 relative mean difference between the groups. The difference was apparent at the first post-randomization visit and continued throughout the trial. (Fig 1) Over the 42 days of observation, an effect size of .37 was identified with a statistically significant P value of 0.025 on the Mixed Model for Repeated Measures methodology agreed to with FDA in the 2018 Special Protocol Agreement. Akathisia as ascertained by a 1 point increase in the BARS was seen in 11 of participants randomized to lurasidone (comparable to previous reports in the literature) and seen in only 2 of those treated with NRX-101, an akathisia level that was previously reported for the placebo arm of the lurasidone registration trial. 
 
 Akathisia was a prespecified key safety endpoint of the Company s clinical trial. Hence this finding is not a post-hoc observation. As previously noted, this clinical trial of 91 participants with suicidal bipolar depression who were not pre-treated with ketamine demonstrated that NRX-101 and lurasidone were comparable in their antidepressant effect. A 33 but statistically non-significant sustained decrease in suicidality was also seen favoring NRX-101. As noted above, improved antidepressant efficacy is not required to seek drug accelerated drug approval based on a statistically-significant safety benefit. 
 
 The results released on May 24 are consistent with and amplify the results of the Company s previously published STABIL-B trial (Fig 2 below). In both trials a meaningful reduction in Akathisia was seen, which was statistically significant in the current trial (P

 Incorporation of HOPE Therapeutics and progress towards an NDA for HTX-100 (IV ketamine) in the treatment of suicidal depression 
 
 In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company incorporated HOPE Therapeutics as a wholly-owned subsidiary and engaged its auditors who in August 2024 completed an audit of its financial statements which will be necessary for the intended spin-off of HOPE to the Company s shareholders. Intravenous ketamine has now become a standard of care for acute treatment of suicidal depression, in the absence of an FDA-labeled product. Intranasal Esketamine is approved by the FDA (SPRAVATO ), but has not demonstrated a benefit on suicidality and is not approved for use in patients with bipolar depression. Attempts to use intranasal racemic ketamine for suicidal depression have failed. 
 
 The Company has formed data-sharing partnerships to license clinical trial data from a French Government-funded trial and two National Institute of Health (NIH)-funded trials all of which demonstrate efficacy of racemic Intravenous ketamine against depression and two of which demonstrate statistically significant benefit vs suicidality. The Company s role is to reformat these data into the required presentation required for review by the FDA. 
 
 In contrast to nasal ketamine, Intravenous racemic ketamine demonstrates dramatic and immediate reduction of suicidality in patients with both Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Depression. Grunebaum and colleagues demonstrated a rapid and statistically significant reduction in Suicidal Ideation at day 1 (p=0.0003) and in depression (P=0.0234), as measured by the Profile of Mood States among patients randomized to IV Ketamine compared to those randomized to midazolam. This trial was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry . Abbar and colleagues similarly published 84 remission from suicidality on the C-SSRS in patients treated with ketamine, vs. 28 in those treated with placebo (P 
 
 In November 2023, the Company initiated manufacture of ketamine together with Nephron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to develop a single patient presentation of ketamine. Twelve-month real-time stability on the first manufactured lot of NRX-100 (ketamine) at Nephron Pharmaceuticals, utilizing commercial scale processes, was reached on September 24, 2024. Demonstrating the ability to manufacture drug product, and prove its stability, are critical components of the drug approval process with the US FDA. 
 
 A long-term challenge with ketamine is that the current formulation (KETALAR is highly acidic. While it is suitable for intravenous use, it cannot be administered subcutaneously. In March 2024 the Company demonstrated the formulation of a pH neutral patentable form of IV ketamine that it anticipates will have widespread applicability both in treatment of depression and chronic pain.

Treatment of Urinary Tract Infection UTI and Urosepsis: 
 
 Although treatment of UTI is quite different from use of NRX-101 to treat Central Nervous System disorders, D-cycloserine was originally developed as an antibiotic because of its role in disrupting the cell wall of certain pathogens. During Q3 2023, NRx tested NRX-101 and its components against resistant pathogens that appear on the Congressionally mandated QIDP list and proved in vitro effectiveness against antibiotic-resistant E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter. Accordingly, NRx was granted QIDP designation, Fast Track Designation, and Priority Review by the US FDA in January 2024. 
 
 In recent years, increased antibiotic resistance to common pathogens that cause urinary tract infections and urosepsis (i.e., sepsis originating in the urinary tract) has resulted in a marked increase in cUTI, hospitalization, and death from urosepsis. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that more than 1.7 million Americans contract sepsis each year, of whom at least 350,000 die during their hospitalization or are discharged to hospice (CDC Sepsis Ref.). There are approximately three million patients per year who contract cUTI in the U.S. annually (Lodise, et. al.). Additionally, should NRX-101 succeed in clinical trials, the Company will consider developing a follow-on product that is anticipated to achieve another 20 years of patent exclusivity. 
 
 A key challenge in the treatment of cUTI is the tendency of advanced antibiotics to cause C. Difficile infection, which is fatal in 10 of those who contract it over the age of 65 and results in prolonged hospitalization in many more. The Company recently announced data demonstrating that NRX-101 does not compromise the intestinal microbiome, unlike common antibiotics including Clindamycin and Ciprofloxacin. Should these findings be documented in human patients, NRX-101 would represent the only treatment for cUTI that does not cause C. Difficile infection.

Financial Results 
 
 Since inception, the Company has incurred significant operating losses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s net loss was 1.6 million and 6.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s net loss was 16.0 million and 25.8 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 269.2 million, a stockholders deficit of 18.8 million and a working capital deficit of 16.2 million. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The Company has secured operating capital that it anticipates as sufficient to fund its drug development operations through year end and to finance submission of FDA New Drug Applications for NRX-100 and NRX-101. The Company may pursue additional equity or debt financing or refinancing opportunities in 2024 to fund ongoing clinical activities, to meet obligations under its current debt arrangements and for general corporate purposes. Such arrangements may take the form of loans, equity offerings, strategic agreements, licensing agreements, joint ventures or other agreements. The sale of equity could result in additional dilution to the Company s existing shareholders. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms, or that it will be able to refinance its existing debt obligations which could negatively impact the Company s business and operations and could also lead to a reduction in the Company s operations. The Company will continue to carefully monitor the impact of its continuing operations on the Company s working capital needs and debt repayment obligations. As such, the Company has concluded that substantial doubt exists regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company has generated no revenues, has incurred operating losses since inception, expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. Until such time as the Company is able to establish a revenue stream from the sale of its therapeutic products, it is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. The Company cannot make any assurances that sales of NRX-101 will commence in the near term or that additional financings will be available to it on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact our business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of our operations.

The Note may not be prepaid by the Company however, the holders of the Note may elect to convert the Notes, in whole or in part, into shares of the Company s common stock at any time after the original issuance date.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company is not party to any off-balance sheet transactions. The Company has no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 
 The Company's management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with GAAP, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The most critical estimates relate to the stock-based compensation, the valuation of warrants, and the fair value of notes payable. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experiences, and various other factors that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Table of Contents 

The Company defines its critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require it to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which the Company applies those principles. While its significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to its financial statements, the Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. 
 
 Stock-based compensation 
 
 We measure stock option awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. For restricted stock awards, the grant date fair value is the fair market value per share as of the grant date based on the closing trading price for the Company s stock. The straight-line method of expense recognition is applied to awards with service-only conditions. We account for forfeitures as they occur. 
 
 We estimate the fair value of each stock option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our Common Stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our Common Stock, the expected term of our stock-based awards, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock-based awards, and our expected dividend yield. Therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on the implied volatility of publicly traded warrants on our Common Stock and historical volatility of a set of our publicly traded peer companies. We estimate the expected term of our options using the "simplified" method for awards that qualify as "plain-vanilla" options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends on Common Stock and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 
 The assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock-based awards represent reasonable estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. 
 
 Warrant liabilities 
 
 We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own Common Stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 
 
 For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, or date of modification, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the earnout cash milestone and earnout shares milestone probabilities of achievement at each reporting period.

Convertible notes payable 
 
 As permitted under FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments ASC 825 ), the Company elects to account for its convertible promissory note, which meets the required criteria, at fair value at inception and at each subsequent reporting date. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as a component of non-operating loss in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of electing the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the convertible promissory notes are expensed as incurred. 
 
 The Company estimates the fair value of its notes payable using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses as inputs the fair value of its Common Stock and estimates for the equity volatility of its Common Stock, the time to expiration (i.e., expected term) of the note, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the time to expiration, and probability of default. Therefore, the Company estimates its expected future equity volatility based on the historical volatility of its Common Stock price utilizing a lookback period consistent with the time to expiration. The time to expiration is based on the contractual maturity date, giving consideration to the redemption features embedded in the notes. The risk-free interest rate is determined based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to the time to expiration. Unless otherwise specified, the probability of default is estimated using Bloomberg s Default Risk function which uses its financial information to calculate a default risk specific to the Company. For the Streeterville valuations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the probability of default was based on management's estimates which include, the Company's current cash runway, current efforts to raise financing, and current economic environment. Interest expense is included within the fair value of the note payable. Management believes those assumptions are reasonable but if these assumptions change, it could materially affect the fair value. 
 
 The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the convertible note payable represent reasonable estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company s uses significantly different assumptions or estimates, the change in fair value of the convertible note payable recorded to other (income) expense could be materially different in the future. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we were required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation as of September 30, 2024 under the supervision, and with the participation, of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who serves as our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (who serves as our principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. 
 
 Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 in providing reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
