 Contract Balances and Accounts Receivable 
 A receivable is an unconditional right to consideration and is recognized when shipments have been completed and the related performance obligation has been fully satisfied. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the accounts receivable, trade, net, balance was million and million, respectively. Contract assets represent a conditional right to consideration in exchange for goods or services and are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance of contract assets was million and million, respectively. We have recognized contract assets within the other current assets financial statement caption on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. These contract assets are considered current assets as they will be settled in less than 12 months. 
 Contract liabilities represent advance consideration received from customers and are recognized as revenues over time as the related performance obligation is satisfied. A t September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, t he balance o f contract liabilities was million and million, respectively. The amount of revenues recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was included in the December 31, 2023 contract liability balance was million. We have recognized contract liabilities within the accounts payable and other current liabilities financial statement captions on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. These contract liabilities are considered current liabilities as they will be settled in less than 12 months. 
 Performance Obligations 
 We have elected to apply the practical expedient in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers , to not disclose the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to future reporting periods for freight shipments started but not completed at the reporting date that we expect to recognize as revenue in the period subsequent to the reporting date; transit times generally average approximately days. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenues recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) were not material.

 Operating leases are included in other non-current assets, other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. These assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date, using our incremental borrowing rate because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable. We have certain contracts for real estate that may contain lease and non-lease components which we have elected to treat as a single lease component. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease expense is recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Lease expense is reported in rent and purchased transportation on the consolidated statements of income.

 (1) The measurement period adjustment was recorded in goodwill on the consolidated condensed balance sheet. 
 The estimated fair values of our contingent consideration arrangements are based upon probability-adjusted inputs for each acquired entity. Additionally, as the liability is stated at present value, the passage of time alone will increase the estimated fair value of the liability each reporting period. Change in fair value is recorded in other operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income. 
 We have ownership interests in investments, primarily Mastery Logistics Systems, Inc.

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value 
 Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable trade, and accounts payable are short-term in nature and accordingly are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. 
 The carrying amount of our fixed-rate debt not measured at fair value on a recurring basis was million as of December 31, 2023. We had fixed-rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The estimated fair value of our fixed-rate debt using the income approach, based on its net present value, discounted at our current borrowing rate, was million as of December 31, 2023 (categorized as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). The carrying amount of our variable-rate long-term debt approximates fair value due to the duration of our credit arrangement and the variable interest rate.

 billion unsecured credit facility with a group of lenders (the 2022 Credit Agreement ), replacing our previous credit facilities. The 2022 Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature on December 20, 2027, and has a million maximum limit for the aggregate amount of letters of credit issued. 
 Revolving credit loans drawn under the 2022 Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at (i) the Base Rate (the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus , or (c) the one-month Term SOFR plus ), plus a margin ranging between and , or (ii) Term SOFR plus and a margin ranging between and . Swingline loans drawn under the 2022 Credit Agreement bear interest at the Base Rate, as defined above, plus a margin ranging between and . The 2022 Credit Agreement also requires us to pay quarterly (i) a letter of credit commission on the daily amount available to be drawn under such standby letters of credit at rates ranging between and per annum and (ii) a nonrefundable commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the commitment at rates ranging between and per annum. The margin, letter of credit commission, and commitment fee rates are based on our ratio of net funded debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ). There are no scheduled principal payments due on the 2022 Credit Agreement until the maturity date, and interest is payable in arrears at periodic intervals not to exceed three months. 
 We have entered into variable-for-fixed interest rate swap agreements in order to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates on a portion of our variable-rate indebtedness. Under the terms of our interest rate swap agreements, we receive monthly variable-rate interest payments based on one-month Term SOFR and make monthly fixed-rate interest payments as specified in the interest rate swap agreements. We have designated our interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges. Changes in fair value of outstanding derivatives in cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until earnings are impacted by the hedged transactions. variable-for-fixed interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million matured in May 2024. In August 2024, we entered into a variable-for-fixed interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million, maturing in 2028, and during the three months ended June 30, 2024, we entered into variable-for-fixed interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million, maturing in 2027. 
 On June 30, 2021, we entered into a million unsecured fixed-rate term loan commitment with BMO Harris, with quarterly principal payments of million and a final payment of principal and interest due and payable on May 14, 2024 ("BMO Term Loan"). We repaid the remaining million outstanding principal balance under the BMO Term Loan in May 2024 using proceeds from the 2022 Credit Agreement.

million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding revolving credit loan balance under the 2022 Credit Agreement, consisted of: 
 million at a variable interest rate of ; 
 million which is effectively fixed at with interest rate swap agreements through July 2025; 
 million which is effectively fixed at with interest rate swap agreements through July 2026; 
 million which is effectively fixed at with an interest rate swap agreement through April 2027; 
 million which is effectively fixed at with an interest rate swap agreement through May 2027; and 
 million which is effectively fixed at with an interest rate swap agreement through August 2028. 
 Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in October 2024, we borrowed million on our revolving line of credit. Our total available borrowing capacity under the 2022 Credit Agreement was million as of September 30, 2024, after considering million in stand-by letters of credit under which we are obligated. 
 Availability of such funds under the current debt agreement is conditional upon various customary terms and covenants. Such covenants include, among other things, two financial covenants requiring us (i) not to exceed a maximum ratio of net funded debt to EBITDA and (ii) to exceed a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants.

 We are involved in certain claims and pending litigation, including those described herein, arising in the ordinary course of business. The majority of these claims relate to bodily injury, property damage, cargo and workers compensation incurred in the transportation of freight, as well as certain class action litigation related to personnel and employment matters. We accrue for the uninsured portion of contingent losses from these and other pending claims when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Based on the knowledge of the facts, management believes the resolution of claims and pending litigation, taking into account existing reserves, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and our view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and related events unfold. 
 On May 17, 2018, in Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, a jury rendered an adverse verdict against the Company in a lawsuit arising from a December 30, 2014 accident between a Werner tractor-trailer and a passenger vehicle. On July 30, 2018, the court entered a final judgment against Werner for million, including pre-judgment interest. 
 The Company has premium-based liability insurance to cover the potential outcome from this jury verdict. Under the Company s insurance policies in effect on the date of this accident, the Company s maximum liability for this accident is million (plus pre-judgment and post-judgment interest) with premium-based coverage that exceeds the jury verdict amount. As a result of this jury verdict, the Company had recorded a liability of million as of September 30, 2024, and million as of December 31, 2023. Under the terms of the Company s insurance policies, the Company is the primary obligor of the verdict, and as such, the Company has also recorded a million receivable from its third-party insurance providers in other non-current assets and a corresponding liability of the same amount in the long-term portion of insurance and claims accruals in the consolidated condensed balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The Company pursued an appeal of this verdict, and on May 18, 2023, the Texas Court of Appeals overruled Werner s appeal and affirmed the trial court s judgment. The Company has since filed a Petition for Review with the Texas Supreme Court, seeking further review of the Texas Court of Appeals decision. On August 30, 2024 the Texas Supreme Court granted the Company s Petition for Review. Oral argument is scheduled for December 3, 2024. No assurances can be given regarding the outcome of the review.

 reportable segments Truckload Transportation Services TTS and Werner Logistics. 
 The TTS segment consists of operating units, Dedicated and One-Way Truckload. These units are aggregated because they have similar economic characteristics and meet the other aggregation criteria described in the accounting guidance for segment reporting. Dedicated provides truckload services dedicated to a specific customer, generally for a retail distribution center or manufacturing facility, utilizing either dry van or specialized trailers. One-Way Truckload is comprised of the following operating fleets: (i) the medium-to-long-haul van Van fleet transports a variety of consumer nondurable products and other commodities in truckload quantities over irregular routes using dry van trailers, including Mexico cross-border routes; (ii) the expedited Expedited fleet provides time-sensitive truckload services utilizing driver teams; (iii) the regional short-haul Regional fleet provides comparable truckload van service within geographic regions across the United States; and (iv) the Temperature Controlled fleet provides truckload services for temperature sensitive products over irregular routes utilizing temperature-controlled trailers. Revenues for the TTS segment include a small amount of non-trucking revenues which consist primarily of the intra-Mexico portion of cross-border shipments delivered to or from Mexico where we utilize a third-party capacity provider. 
 The Werner Logistics segment is a non-asset-based transportation and logistics provider. Werner Logistics provides services throughout North America and generates the majority of our non-trucking revenues through operating units. These Werner Logistics operating units are as follows: (i) Truckload Logistics, which uses contracted carriers to complete shipments for brokerage customers and freight management customers for which we offer a full range of single-source logistics management services and solutions; (ii) the Intermodal Intermodal unit offers rail transportation through alliances with rail and drayage providers as an alternative to truck transportation; and (iii) Werner Final Mile Final Mile offers residential and commercial deliveries of large or heavy items using third-party agents, independent contractors, and Company employees with two-person delivery teams operating a liftgate straight truck. 
 We generate other revenues from our driver training schools, transportation-related activities such as third-party equipment maintenance and equipment leasing, and other business activities. None of these operations meets the quantitative reporting thresholds. As a result, these operations are grouped in Other in the tables below. Corporate includes revenues and expenses that are incidental to our activities and are not attributable to any of our operating segments, including gains and losses on sales of property and equipment not attributable to our operating segments.

 Overview: 
 We have two reportable segments, TTS and Werner Logistics, and we operate in the truckload and logistics sectors of the transportation industry. In the truckload sector, we focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that generally ship more consistently throughout the year. In the logistics sector, besides managing transportation requirements for individual customers, we provide additional sources of truck capacity, alternative modes of transportation, a North American delivery network and systems analysis to optimize transportation needs. Our success depends on our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to our customers. Resource requirements vary with customer demand, which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions. Our ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is essential to efficiently deploy resources and make capital investments in tractors and trailers (with respect to our TTS segment) or obtain qualified third-party capacity at a reasonable price (with respect to our Werner Logistics segment). We may also be affected by our customers financial failures or loss of customer business. 
 Revenues for our TTS segment operating units (Dedicated and One-Way Truckload) are typically generated on a per-mile basis and also include revenues such as stop charges, loading and unloading charges, equipment detention charges and equipment repositioning charges. To mitigate our risk to fuel price increases, we recover additional fuel surcharge revenues from our customers that generally recoup a majority of the increased fuel costs; however, we cannot assure that current recovery levels will continue in future periods. Because fuel surcharge revenues fluctuate in response to changes in fuel costs, we identify them separately and exclude them from the statistical calculations to provide a more meaningful comparison between periods. The key statistics used to evaluate trucking revenues, net of fuel surcharge, are (i) average revenues per tractor per week, (ii) average percentage of empty miles (miles without trailer cargo), (iii) average trip length (in loaded miles) and (iv) average number of tractors in service. General economic conditions, seasonal trucking industry freight patterns and industry capacity are important factors that impact these statistics. Our TTS segment also generates a small amount of revenues categorized as non-trucking revenues, which consist primarily of the intra-Mexico portion of cross-border shipments delivered to or from Mexico where the TTS segment utilizes a third-party capacity provider. We exclude such revenues from the statistical calculations. 
 Our most significant resource requirements are company drivers, independent contractors, tractors, and trailers with respect to our TTS segment and qualified third-party capacity providers with respect to our Werner Logistics segment. Independent contractors supply their own tractors and drivers and are responsible for their operating expenses. Our financial results are affected by company driver and independent contractor availability and the markets for new and used revenue equipment. We are self-insured for a significant portion of bodily injury, property damage and cargo claims; workers compensation claims; and associate health claims (supplemented by premium-based insurance coverage above certain dollar levels). For that reason, our financial results may also be affected by driver safety, medical costs, weather, legal and regulatory environments and insurance coverage costs to protect against catastrophic losses. 
 The operating ratio is a common industry measure used to evaluate our profitability and that of our TTS segment operating fleets. The operating ratio consists of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues. The most significant variable expenses that impact the TTS segment are driver salaries and benefits, fuel, fuel taxes (included in taxes and licenses expense), payments to independent contractors (included in rent and purchased transportation expense), supplies and maintenance and insurance and claims. As discussed further in the comparison of operating results for third quarter 2024 to third quarter 2023, several industry-wide issues have caused, and could continue to cause, costs to increase in future periods. These issues include shortages of drivers or independent contractors, changing fuel prices, changing used truck and trailer pricing, compliance with new or proposed regulations and tightening of the commercial truck liability insurance market. Our main fixed costs include depreciation expense for tractors and trailers and equipment licensing fees (included in taxes and licenses expense). The TTS segment requires substantial cash expenditures for tractor and trailer purchases. We fund these purchases with net cash from operations and financing available under our existing credit facility, as management deems necessary.

We provide non-trucking services primarily through the three operating units within our Werner Logistics segment (Truckload Logistics, Intermodal, and Final Mile). Unlike our TTS segment, the Werner Logistics segment is less asset-intensive and is instead dependent upon qualified associates, information systems and qualified third-party capacity providers. The largest expense item related to the Werner Logistics segment is the cost of purchased transportation we pay to third-party capacity providers. This expense item is recorded as rent and purchased transportation expense. Other operating expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits, as well as depreciation and amortization, supplies and maintenance, and other general expenses. We evaluate the Werner Logistics segment s financial performance by reviewing operating expenses and operating income expressed as a percentage of revenues. Purchased transportation expenses as a percentage of revenues can be impacted by the rates charged to customers and the costs of securing third-party capacity. We have a mix of contracted long-term rates and variable rates for the cost of third-party capacity, and we cannot assure that our operating results will not be adversely impacted in the future if our ability to obtain qualified third-party capacity providers changes or the rates of such providers increase.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating Revenues 
 Operating reve nues decreased 8.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, comp ared to the same period of the prior year. When comparing third quarter 2024 to third quarter 2023, TTS segment reven ues decreased 49.4 million, or 8.6 , and Werner Logistics revenues decreased 23.5 million, or 10.2 . 
 Dedicated freight demand remains steady and durable despite a continued challenging freight market, and the Dedicated customer retention rate and pipeline of opportunities remain strong. In One-Way Truckload, our pricing discipline, combined with better freight options and strong miles per tractor, led to a 6.9 increase in average revenues per tractor per week, net of fuel surcharge during third quarter 2024. Werner Logistics revenues and profitability continue to be impacted by ongoing pricing pressure. 
 Trucking revenues, net of fuel surcharge, decreased 6.7 in third quart er 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 due to a 9.9 decrease in the average number of tractors in service, partially offset by a 3.5 increase in average revenues per tractor per week, net of fuel surcharge. During third quarter 2024, One-Way Truckload average revenues per total mile, net of fuel surcharg e, increased 0.3 . One-Way Truckload average tractors in service decreased 12.3 , partially offset with 6.6 higher average total miles per tractor per week in third quarter 2024. As a result, One-Way Truckload total miles were down only 6.6 compared to third quarter 2023. We expect average revenues per total mile, net of fuel surcharge, for the One-Way Truckload fleet to remain flat or increase up to 3 in fourth quarter 2024 compared to fourth quarter 2023, as we see increasing opportunity for favorable rate changes going forward. Dedicated average revenues per tractor per week, net of fuel surcharge, increased 1.7 . We continue to expect Dedicated average revenues per tractor per week, net of fuel surcharge, to remain flat or increase up to 3 in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 The average number of tractors in service in the TTS segment decreased 9.9 to 7,414 in third qu arter 2024 from 8,226 in third quarter 2023. The prolonged weak freight market combined with the impact from certain fleet losses as a result of maintaining our pricing and operating margin discipline resulted in fewer tractors at the end of third quarter 2024. W e ended third quarter 2024 wi th 7,445 tractors in the TTS segment, a year-over-year decrease of 725 tractors compared to the e nd of third quarter 2023, and a sequenti al decrease of 15 tractors compared to the end of second quarter 2024. Within TTS, our Dedicated unit ended third quarter 2024 with 4,905 tractors (or 66 of our total TTS segment fleet) compared to 5,260 tractors (or 64 a year ago. We currently expect our TTS segment fleet size at the end of 2024 to decrease in a range of 8 to 6 when compared to the fleet size at the end of 2023, as we see potential for a decrease in our Dedicated fleet, partially offset by growth in our One-Way fleet in fourth quarter 2024. We cannot predict whether future driver shortages, if any, would have a further adverse effect on our fleet size. If such a driver market shortage were to occur, it could result in further fleet size reductions, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Trucking fuel surcharge revenues decreased 24.2 to 62.7 million in third quarter 2024 from 82.7 million in third quarter 2023. These revenues represent collections from customers for the increase in fuel and fuel-related expenses, including the fuel 
 22

component of our independent contractor cost (recorded as rent and purchased transportation expense) and fuel taxes (recorded in taxes and licenses expense), when diesel fuel prices rise. Conversely, when fuel prices decrease, fuel surcharge revenues decrease. To lessen the effect of fluctuating fuel prices on our margins, we collect fuel surcharge revenues from our customers for the cost of diesel fuel and taxes in excess of specified base fuel price levels according to terms in our customer contracts. Fuel surcharge rates generally adjust weekly based on an independent U.S. Department of Energy fuel price survey which is released every Monday. Our fuel surcharge programs are designed to (i) recoup higher fuel costs from customers when fuel prices rise and (ii) provide customers with the benefit of lower fuel costs when fuel prices decline. These programs generally enable us to recover a majority, but not all, of the fuel price increases. The remaining portion is generally not recoverable because it results from empty and out-of-route miles (which are not billable to customers) and tractor idle time. Fuel prices that change rapidly in short time periods also impact our recovery because the surcharge rate in most programs only changes once per week. 
 Werner Logistics revenues are generated by its three operating units. Werner Logistics recorded revenue and brokered freight expense of 3.2 million in third quarter 2024 and 4.4 million in third quarter 2023 for certain shipments performed by the TTS segment (also recorded as trucking revenue by the TTS segment), and these transactions between reporting segments are eliminated in consolidation. In third quarter 2024, Werner Logistics revenues decreased 23.5 million, or 10.2 , compared to third quarter 2023. Truckload Logistics revenues (75 of total Werner Logistics segment revenues) decreased 20.9 million, or 12 , in third quarter 2024, driven by a decrease in shipments, partially offset by an increase in revenue per shipment. The Power Only solution, which utilizes third-party carriers who provide only a driver and a tractor, represented a growing portion of the Truckload Logistics volume in third quarter 2024, as Power Only volumes increased over 18 in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023. Intermodal revenues (14 of total Werner Logistics segment revenues) increased 2.0 million, or 7 , in third quarter 2024, due to an increase in shipments, partially offset by lower revenue per shipment. Final Mile revenues (11 of total Werner Logistics segment revenues) decreased 4.6 million, or 17 , in third quarter 2024 due to lower volume for furniture and appliances, and timing of isolated churn ahead of new customer facilities being implemented. Werner Logistics had an operating loss of 0.3 million in third quarter 2024 compared to operating income of 2.0 million in third quarter 2023, and its operating margin percentage decreased to (0.2) in third quarter 2024 from 0.9 in third quarter 2023. The operating environment continues to be competitive, which is pressuring Werner Logistics operating margins in the short term. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating ratio (operati ng expenses expressed as a percentage of ope rating revenues) was 97.6 in third quarter 2024 compared to 95.4 in third quarter 2023. Expense items that impacted the overall operating ratio are described on the following pages. The tables on pages 20 through 22 show the consolidated statements of income in dollars and as a percentage of total operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease in the dollar amounts of those items compared to the same period of the prior year, as well as the operating ratios, operating margins, and certain statistical information for our two reportable segments, TTS and Werner Logistics. 
 Salaries, wages and benefits decreased 9.7 million or 3.6 in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 and increased 1.8 as a percentage of operating revenues to 34.6 . The lower dollar amount of salaries, wages and benefits expense in the third quarter of 2024 was due primarily to the impact of 12.2 million fewer company tractor miles and decreased non-driver pay in the third quarter 2024, partially offset by higher benefit costs resulting primarily from elevated health care claims. The decrease in non-driver pay was due primarily to a smaller average number of non-driver employees. Non-driver salaries, wages and benefits in our non-trucking Werner Logistics segment decreased 11 in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023. 
 We renewed our workers compensation insurance coverage on April 1, 2024. Our coverage levels are the same as the prior policy year. We continue to maintain a self-insurance retention of 2.0 million per claim. Our workers compensation insurance premiums for the policy year beginning April 2024 are 0.3 million higher than the previous policy year. 
 While we currently believe the driver recruiting and retention market may be less difficult in the near term, a competitive driver market presents labor challenges for customers and carriers alike. Several factors impacting the driver market include a declining number of, and increased competition for, driver training school graduates, aging truck driver demographics and increased truck safety regulations. We continue to take significant actions to strengthen our driver recruiting and retention as we strive to be the truckload employer of choice, including competitive driver pay, providing a modern tractor and trailer fleet with the latest safety equipment and technology, investing in our driver training school network and offering a wide variety of driving positions including daily and weekly home time opportunities. We are unable to predict whether we will experience future driver shortages or maintain our current driver retention rates. If such a driver shortage were to occur and driver pay rate increases became necessary to attract and retain drivers, our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that we could not obtain corresponding freight rate increases.

Fuel decreased 25.5 million or 28.2 in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 and decreased 2.3 as a percentage of operating revenues, due primarily to lower average diesel fuel prices and 12.2 million fewer company tractor miles in third quarter 2024. Average diesel fuel prices were 69 cents per gallon lower in third quarter 2024 than in third quarter 2023 and were 16 cents per gallon lower than in second quarter 2024. 
 We continue to employ measures to improve our fuel mpg such as (i) limiting tractor engine idle time by installing auxiliary power units, (ii) optimizing the speed, weight and specifications of our equipment and (iii) implementing mpg-enhancing equipment changes to our fleet including new tractors, more aerodynamic tractor features, idle reduction systems, trailer tire inflation systems, trailer skirts and automated manual transmissions to reduce our fuel gallons purchased. However, fuel savings from mpg improvement is partially offset by higher depreciation expense and the additional cost of diesel exhaust fluid. Although our fuel management programs require significant capital investment and research and development, we intend to continue these and other environmentally conscious initiatives, including our active participation as a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA SmartWay Transport Partner. The SmartWay Transport Partnership is a national voluntary program developed by the EPA and freight industry representatives to reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution and promote cleaner, more efficient ground freight transportation. 
 For October 2024, the average diesel fuel price per gallon was approximately 86 cents lower than the average diesel fuel price per gallon in October 2023 and approximately 58 cents lower than in fourth quarter 2023. 
 Shortages of fuel, increases in fuel prices and petroleum product rationing can have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. We are unable to predict whether fuel price levels will increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers. As of September 30, 2024, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations. 
 Supplies and maintenance increased 1.4 million or 2.3 in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 and increased 0.8 as a percentage of operating revenues. Supplies and maintenance expense increased due primarily to the higher costs for over-the-road tractor maintenance despite 12.2 million fewer company tractor miles. We have taken steps to reduce repair and maintenance expense by growing our in-house maintenance capabilities throughout our terminal network. 
 Insurance and claims decreased 3.6 million or 11.5 in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 and decreased 0.1 as a percentage of operating revenues. We had lower expense for small dollar liability claims, resulting primarily from lower expense for new claims and a higher amount of favorable reserve development. Our expense for large dollar liability claims was also lower, primarily due to a lower amount of unfavorable reserve development, partially offset by higher expense for new claims. Expense for new claims was impacted by decreased cost per claim in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023. We also incurred insurance and claims expense of 1.5 million in third quarter 2024 and 1.4 million for third quarter 2023, for accrued interest related to a previously-disclosed adverse jury verdict rendered on May 17, 2018, which we are continuing to defend. Interest is accrued at 0.5 million per month until such time as the outcome of the litigation is finalized, excluding months where the plaintiffs requested an extension of time to respond to our petition for review. For additional information related to this lawsuit, see Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Part I of this report. The majority of our insurance and claims expense results from our claim experience and claim development under our self-insurance program; the remainder results from insurance premiums for claims in excess of our self-insured limits. 
 We ren ewed our liability insurance policies on August 1, 2024, and are responsible for the first 15.0 million per claim on all claims with an annual 7.5 million aggregate for claims between 15.0 million and 20.0 million. For the policy year that began August 1, 2023, we were responsible for the first 10.0 million per claim on all claims with an annual 12.5 million aggregate for claims between 10.0 million and 20.0 million . We maintain liability insurance coverage with insurance carriers in excess of the 15.0 million per claim. Our liability insurance premiums for the policy year that began August 1, 2024 are lower than premiums for the previous policy year as a result of changes in our retention levels. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 3.0 million or 4.0 in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 and increased 0.5 as a percentage of operating revenues due primarily to decreases in depreciation of tractors as we had fewer average tractors in service, and technology equipment as we continue to transition to more cloud-based technology solutions. These decreases were partially offset by the higher cost of new tractors and trailers. 
 The average age of our tractor fleet remains low by industry standards and was 2.0 years as of September 30, 2024, and the average age of our trailers was 5.2 years. We are continuing to invest in new tractors and trailers, technology, and our terminal network in 2024 to improve our driver experience, increase operational efficiency and more effectively manage our maintenance, safety and fuel costs. During the remainder of 2024, we expect the average age of our tractor and trailer fleets to increase slightly.

Rent and purchased transportation expense decreased 12.9 million or 5.7 in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023, and increased 0.9 as a percentage of operating revenues. Rent and purchased transportation expense consists mostly of payments to third-party capacity providers in the Werner Logistics segment and other non-trucking operations, payments to independent contractors in the TTS segment, and cloud-based technology fees. The payments to third-party capacity providers generally vary depending on changes in the volume of services generated by the Werner Logistics segment. Werner Logistics recorded revenue and brokered freight expense of 3.2 million in third quarter 2024 and 4.4 million in third quarter 2023 for certain shipments performed by the TTS segment (also recorded as trucking revenue by the TTS segment), and these transactions between reporting segments are eliminated in consolidation. Werner Logistics purchased transportation expense decreased 18.7 million in third quarter 2024 as a result of lower logistics revenues, but increased to 85.2 as a percentage of Werner Logistics revenues in third quarter 2024 from 84.7 in third quarter 2023 due to the competitive operating environment in 2024. 
 Rent and purchased transportation expense for the TTS segment increased 4.6 million in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 due primarily to higher cloud-based technology fees and independent contractor miles, partially offset by lower reimbursements to independent contractors because of lower average diesel fuel prices. Independent contractor miles increased approximately 0.4 million miles in third quarter 2024 and as a percentage of total miles were 5.1 in third quarter 2024 compared to 4.6 in third quarter 2023. Because independent contractors supply their own tractors and drivers and are responsible for their operating expenses, the increase in independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles shifted costs from other expense categories, including (i) salaries, wages and benefits, (ii) fuel, (iii) depreciation, (iv) supplies and maintenance and (v) taxes and licenses to the rent and purchased transportation category. 
 Challenging operating conditions continue to make independent contractor recruitment and retention difficult. Such conditions include inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of independent contractors and a shortage of financing available to independent contractors for equipment purchases. Historically, we have been able to add company tractors and recruit additional company drivers to offset any decrease in the number of independent contractors. If a shortage of independent contractors and company drivers were to occur, increases in per-mile settlement rates (for independent contractors) and driver pay rates (for company drivers) may become necessary to attract and retain these drivers. These increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we would not be able to obtain corresponding freight rate increases. 
 Other operating expenses increased 4.2 million in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 and increased 0.6 as a percentage of operating revenues due to lower gains on sales of property and equipment (primarily used tractors and trailers), partially offset by decreased bad debt expense and decreased costs associated with professional technology services. Gains on sales of property and equipment are reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses and are reported net of sales-related expenses (which include costs to prepare the equipment for sale). Gains on sales of property and equipment were 2.6 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 9.1 million in third quarter 2023. We sold fewer tractors and substantially more trailers in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 and realized lower average gains per tractor and trailer due to lower pricing in the market for our used equipment. We expect our gains on sales of property and equipment to be considerably lower in 2024 compared to 2023, in a range between 7 million and 11 million for the year, not including gains of 1.8 million from the sale of real estate in second quarter 2024, as we expect lower pricing for our used equipment to continue. 
 Other Expense (Income) 
 Other expense, net of other income, increased 1.7 million in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023, due primarily to a 2.3 million increase in net interest expense, partially offset by a 0.4 million increase in the amount of earnings recognized from our equity method investment (see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Part I of this report for information regarding our equity method investment). Net interest expense increased due to the impact of replacing lower-cost debt and interest rate swaps with higher-cost debt and interest rate swaps upon maturity, an increase in average debt outstanding, and higher interest rates for variable-rate debt. In May 2024, we repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance under the BMO Term Loan using proceeds from the 2022 Credit Agreement, and two variable-for-fixed interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 150.0 million matured. In August 2024, we entered into a variable-for-fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount of 75 million, and during the second quarter 2024, we entered into two variable-for-fixed interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 150.0 million to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates on a portion of our variable-rate indebtedness (see Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Part I of this report for further information on our debt and interest rate swaps). We continue to expect net interest expense for full-year 2024 to be higher than 2023, primarily due to repricing of the BMO Term Loan that matured in May 2024 and the impact of two lower-priced interest rate swaps that matured in May 2024 as described above.

Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense decreased 5.0 million in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023, due primarily to lower pre-tax income. Our effective income tax rate (income taxes expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes) was 23.5 in third quarter 2024 compared to 23.0 in third quarter 2023. The lower effective income tax rate in both third quarter 2024 and 2023 are attributed primarily to favorable discrete income tax items. We currently estimate our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will increase to a range of 25.5 to 26.5 . 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating Revenues 
 Operating revenues decreased 7.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of the prior year. When comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023, TTS segment revenues decreased 119.7 million, or 6.9 , and Werner Logistics revenues decreased 65.3 million, or 9.6 . In the TTS segment, trucking revenues, net of fuel surcharge, decreased 84.2 million, due primarily to an 8.6 decrease in average tractors in service, partially offset by a 3.1 increase in average revenues per tractor per week, net of fuel surcharge. TTS segment fuel surcharge revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 42.0 million, or 17.0 , when compared to the same period of the prior year due to lower average diesel fuel prices in the 2024 period. The lower Logistics revenues resulted from continued pricing pressure. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating ratio (operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues) was 97.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 94.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Expense items that impacted the overall operating ratio are described on the following pages. The tables on pages 20 through 22 show the consolidated statements of income in dollars and as a percentage of total operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease in the dollar amounts of those items compared to the same period of the prior year, as well as the operating ratios, operating margins, and certain statistical information for our two reportable segments, TTS and Werner Logistics. 
 Salaries, wages and benefits decreased 19.3 million, or 2.4 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and increased 1.8 as a percentage of operating revenues to 34.4 . The lower dollar amount of salaries, wages and benefits expense in the first nine months of 2024 was due primarily to the impact of 22.1 million fewer company tractor miles and decreased non-driver pay in the first nine months of 2024, partially offset by higher benefit costs. The decrease in non-driver pay was due primarily to a smaller average number of non-driver employees. Non-driver salaries, wages and benefits in our non-trucking Werner Logistics segment decreased 10 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Fuel decreased 45.0 million, or 17.3 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and decreased 1.1 as a percentage of operating revenues due to lower average diesel fuel prices and 22.1 million fewer company tractor miles in the first nine months of 2024. Average diesel fuel prices were 35 cents per gallon lower in the first nine months of 2024 than in same period in 2023. 
 Supplies and maintenance decreased 8.1 million, or 4.2 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and increased 0.3 as a percentage of operating revenues. Supplies and maintenance expense decreased due primarily to lower driver and placement driver-related costs such as lodging and driver advertising, lower costs for over-the-road repairs and tires, and the impact of 22.1 million fewer company tractor miles. These decreases were partially offset by higher costs for tolls. 
 Insurance and claims decreased 8.6 million, or 8.2 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and remained flat as a percentage of operating revenues. We had lower expense for small dollar liability claims, resulting primarily from a higher amount of favorable reserve development, partially offset by higher expense for new claims. Our expense for large dollar liability claims was also lower, primarily due to a lower amount of unfavorable reserve development, partially offset by higher expense for new claims. Higher expense for new claims was impacted by increased cost per claim in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 5.3 million, or 2.4 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and increased 0.5 as a percentage of operating revenues due primarily to decreases in depreciation of tractors as we had fewer average tractors in service, and technology equipment as we continue to transition to more cloud-based technology solutions. Depreciation of other service equipment also decreased due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. These decreases were partially offset by the higher cost of new tractors and trailers. 
 Werner Logistics purchased transportation expense decreased 43.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 as a result of lower logistics revenues, and increased 1.9 as a percentage of Werner Logistics revenues to 85.1 in the first nine months of 2024 from 83.2 in the same period in 2023. Rent and purchased transportation expense for the TTS segment increased 4.4 million 
 26 

Table of Contents 

in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to higher cloud-based technology fees, partially offset by fewer independent contractor miles and lower reimbursements to independent contractors because of lower average diesel fuel prices in the first nine months of 2024. Independent contractor miles decreased approximately 0.9 million miles in the first nine months of 2024 and as a percentage of total miles were 4.7 in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. 
 Other operating expenses increased 25.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and increased 1.0 as a percentage of operating revenues due primarily to lower gains on sales of property and equipment, partially offset by decreased costs associated with professional technology services and decreased bad debt expense. Gains on sales of property and equipment were 8.8 million in the first nine months of 2024, including 1.8 million from the sale of real estate, compared to 39.3 million in the same period in 2023. We sold fewer tractors and substantially more trailers in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and realized lower average gains per tractor and trailer due to lower pricing in the market for our used equipment. 
 Other Expense (Income) 
 Other expense, net of inco me, increased 1.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primari ly to a 3.2 million increase in net interest expense, partially offset by a 1.0 million increase in the amount of earnings from our equity method investment (see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Part I of this report for information regarding our equity method investment). Net interest expense increased due to the impact of replacing lower-cost debt and interest rate swaps with higher-cost debt and interest rate swaps upon certain maturities in the second quarter of 2024, and higher interest rates for variable-rate debt, partially offset by a decrease in average debt outstanding (see Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Part I of this report for further information on our debt and interest rate swaps). 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense decreased 20.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 , due primarily to lower pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in the effective income tax rate. Our effective income tax rate (income taxes expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes) was 26.7 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 24.3 in the first nine months of 2023 . The higher income tax rate was attributed primarily to differences in discrete income tax items in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources: 
 We closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment needed to support business strategies, the performance of the business, capital expenditures, borrowing arrangements, and working capital management. Capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, and dividend payments are components of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which to a large extent, can be adjusted in response to economic and other changes in the business environment. Management s approach to capital allocation focuses on investing in key priorities that support our business and growth strategies and providing stockholder returns, while funding ongoing operations. 
 Management believes our financial position at September 30, 2024 is strong. As of September 30, 2024, we had 54.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and 1.4 billion of stockholders equity. Cash is invested primarily in short-term money market funds. In addition, we have a 1.075 billion credit facility, for which our total available borrowing capacity was 379.1 million as of September 30, 2024 (see Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Part I of this report for information regarding our credit agreements). After considering developments in the banking sector, we believe the six commercial banks in our 1.075 billion syndicated credit facility all have strong tier-one capital ratios and good loan-to-deposit ratios. We believe our liquid assets, cash generated from operating activities, and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility will provide sufficient funds to meet our cash requirements and our planned stockholder returns for the foreseeable future. 
 Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K includes our disclosure of material cash requirements as of December 31, 2023. There were no material changes in the nature of these items during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flows 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated cash flow from operations of 258.7 million, a 27.3 or 97.3 million decrease in cash flows compared to the same nine-month period a year ago. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a decrease in net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and working capital changes. We were able to make net capital expenditures, repay debt, make strategic investments, pay dividends, 
 27 

Table of Contents 

and repurchase company stock with the net cash provided by operating activities and existing cash balances, supplemented by borrowings under our existing credit facility. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 206.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 402.1 million during the same period in 2023. Net property and equipment additions (primarily revenue equipment) were 206.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 374.2 million during the same period of 2023. We currently estimate net capital expenditures (primarily revenue equipment) in 2024 to be in the range of 240 million to 260 million, compared to net capital expenditures in 2023 of 408.7 million. We intend to fund these net capital expenditures through cash flows from operations and financing available under our existing credit facility, if necessary. As of September 30, 2024, we were committed to property and equipment purchases of approximately 81.1 million. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, we purchased a 25.0 million subordinated promissory note from MLSI with a maturity date of January 24, 2030. 
 Net financing activities used 56.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.0 million during the same period in 2023. We had net borrowings on our debt of 41.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increasing our outstanding debt to 690.0 million at September 30, 2024. We had net repayments on our debt of 3.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We paid dividends of 26.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 25.3 million during the same period in 2023. We currently plan to continue paying a quarterly dividend. 
 Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, also included common stock repurchases of 1,787,810 shares at a cost of 67.1 million. We did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the same period in 2023. The Company has repurchased, and may continue to repurchase, shares of the Company s common stock. The timing and amount of such purchases depend upon economic and stock market conditions and other factors. On May 14, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. Upon approval of the new program, the Board of Directors withdrew the previous stock repurchase authorization , which had 1,627,651 shares rem aining available for repurchase . As of September 30, 2024, the Company had purchased 1,103,651 shares pursuant to the new authorization and had 3,896,349 shares remaining available for repurchase. 
 Regulations: 
 Item 1 of Part I of our 2023 Form 10-K includes a discussion of pending proposed regulations that may have an effect on our operations if they become adopted and effective as proposed. The following is an update to the regulations set forth in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 In March 2024, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA released a Final Rule governing Greenhouse Gas GHG Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles - Phase 3, which requires more stringent greenhouse gas standards for heavy-duty vehicles and revises the Phase 2 greenhouse gas standards established in 2016. Short haul (day cab) and long haul (sleeper cab) tractor GHG standards under the Final Rule phase in starting with model years 2028 through 2032. Werner continues to evaluate the Final Rule and any EPA-related developments impacting its fleet. 
 There have been no other material changes in the status of the proposed regulations previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates: 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the (i) reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and (ii) reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis as events and circumstances change, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates and may significantly impact our results of operations from period to period. It is also possible that materially different amounts would be reported if we used different estimates or assumptions. 
 Information regarding our Critical Accounting Estimates can be found in our 2023 Form 10-K. Estimates of accrued liabilities for insurance and claims for bodily injury and property damage is a critical accounting estimate that requires us to make significant judgments and estimates and affects our financial statements. 
 There have been no material changes to this critical accounting estimate from that discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 The price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations attributed to changes in the level of global oil production, refining capacity, regulatory changes, seasonality, weather and other market factors. Historically, we have recovered a majority, but not all, of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges. We implemented customer fuel surcharge programs with most of our customers to offset much of the higher fuel cost per gallon. However, we do not recover all of the fuel cost increase through these surcharge programs. As of September 30, 2024, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We conduct business in foreign countries, primarily in Mexico. To date, most foreign revenues are denominated in U.S. Dollars, and we receive payment for foreign freight services primarily in U.S. Dollars to reduce direct foreign currency risk. Assets and liabilities maintained by a foreign subsidiary company in the local currency are subject to foreign exchange gains or losses. Foreign currency translation gains and losses primarily relate to changes in the value of revenue equipment owned by a subsidiary in Mexico, whose functional currency is the Peso. Foreign currency translation losses were 2.4 million and 1.3 million for third quarter 2024 and 2023, respectively. These losses were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity in the consolidated condensed balance sheets. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We manage interest rate exposure through a mix of variable interest rate debt and interest rate swap agreements. We had 355.0 million of variable interest rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2024, for which the interest rate is effectively fixed at 5.97 with interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate increases. In addition, we had 335.0 million of variable interest rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2024. The interest rates on our credit facility are based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). See Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Part I of this report for further detail of our debt and interest rate swaps. Assuming this level of borrowing, a hypothetical one-percentage point increase in the SOFR interest rate would increase our interest expense by approximately 3.4 million for the next 12-month period. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level in enabling us to record, process, summarize and report information required to be included in our periodic filings with the SEC within the required time period and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that no changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 We have confidence in our internal controls and procedures. Nevertheless, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the internal controls or disclosure procedures and controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met. Further, the design of an internal control system must reflect that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be evaluated relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements and instances of fraud, if any, have been prevented or detected.

PART II 
 OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 For information regarding legal proceedings, see Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Part I of this report. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under Item 1A (Risk Factors) in our 2023 Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and future results of operations. The risks described in our 2023 Form 10 K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The following risk factor amends and restates in its entirety the risk factor included in our 2023 Form 10-K. Only the last paragraph of this risk factor has been modified to describe recent events. There have been no other material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Labor and employment matters, including difficulty in recruiting and retaining experienced drivers, recent driver training school graduates and independent contractors, could impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 At times, the trucking industry has experienced driver shortages. Driver availability may be affected by changing workforce demographics, alternative employment opportunities, national unemployment rates, freight market conditions, availability of financial aid for driver training schools and changing industry regulations. If such a shortage were to occur and driver pay rate increases became necessary to attract and retain drivers, our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that we could not obtain corresponding freight rate increases. Additionally, a shortage of drivers could result in idled equipment, which would affect our profitability and would limit growth opportunities. 
 Independent contractor availability may also be affected by both inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of independent contractors and the availability and cost of equipment financing. Ongoing federal and state legislative challenges to the independent contractor model could also affect independent contractor availability. In recent years, the topic of the classification of individuals as employees or independent contractors has gained increased attention among federal and state regulators as well as the plaintiffs bar. Various legislative or regulatory proposals have been introduced at the federal and state levels that may affect the classification status of individuals as independent contractors or employees for either employment tax purposes (e.g., withholding, social security, Medicare and unemployment taxes) or other benefits available to employees (e.g., workers compensation benefits and minimum wage). Recently, certain states have seen significant increased activity by tax and other regulators regarding worker classification, and class action lawsuits alleging misclassification by transportation companies have resulted in significant damage awards or monetary settlements. Potential changes, if any, that could impact the legal classification of the independent contractor relationship between us and our independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to recruit and retain independent contractors. If a shortage of independent contractors occurs, increases in per-mile settlement rates (for independent contractors) and driver pay rates (for company drivers) may become necessary to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers. These increases would negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we would be unable to obtain corresponding freight rate increases. 
 During 2023, union organizing efforts occurred at two locations of a U.S. subsidiary, which resulted in fewer than 30 of our employees being represented by a union. In September 2024, that small group of drivers filed a petition seeking to decertify the union and end their union s representation. The union responded by voluntarily ending its representation of those drivers and, as a result, those drivers are no longer unionized. Unionization, if broad-based, could have a material adverse effect on our costs, efficiency, and profitability. Driver or other employee dissatisfaction and regulations that govern organization procedures could impact our ability to effectively or timely address any organization efforts. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
 On May 15, 2024, we announced a new stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had purchased 1,103,651 shares pursuant to this authorization and had 3,896,349 shares remaining available for repurchase. The Company may purchase shares from time to time depending on market, economic, and other factors. The authorization will continue unless withdrawn by the Board of Directors.

No shares of common stock were repurchased during third quarter 2024 by either the Company or any affiliated purchaser, as defined by Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 Information Required to be Disclosed on Form 8-K

 Changes to Stockholder Recommendation Procedures 
 On November 8, 2024, the Board of Directors replaced its current Policy Regarding Director Nominations by Stockholders Previous Recommendation Policy and Nominating Committee Directorship Guidelines and Selection Policy with a Director Selection Guidelines Recommendation Policy New Policy ). The New Policy is available on our website, www.werner.com, under the Investors link (Corporate Governance heading). 
 Two requirements in the Previous Recommendation Policy have been removed. A stockholder is no longer required to meet a two percent (2 stock ownership and twelve (12)-month stock holding period requirement to qualify to recommend a director candidate to the Board of Directors. A candidate recommended by the Board of Directors who did not receive at least twenty-five (25 of the votes cast is no longer precluded from being a nominee for four (4) years. 
 The New Policy provides, among other requirements, that the recommending stockholder must submit all information necessary for proper disclosure of director nominee information in a proxy statement and such other information as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may reasonably require, including without limitation certain information, representations or agreements as set forth in the Restated By-Laws. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews stockholder-recommended candidates under the New Policy in the same manner as other candidates. The deadline for submitting a recommendation continues to be one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary of the mailing date of the proxy statement relating to the previous annual meeting of stockholders. 
 In addition to the changes from the Previous Recommendation Policy described herein, the New Policy includes various other revisions, including certain modernizing, technical, conforming and clarifying changes. The foregoing is not a complete description of the New Policy and all the rights and obligations thereunder and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the New Policy on our website.

If the day fixed for the annual meeting shall be a legal holiday in the State of Nebraska, such annual meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day. Annual meetings shall be held in the office of the corporation or at such other place, either within or without the State of Nebraska, as shall be determined by the Board of Directors. If the election of Directors shall not be held on the day designated herein for any annual meeting of the Shareholders, or at any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause the election to be held at a special meeting of the Shareholders as soon thereafter as is convenient. The Board of Directors may postpone, reschedule or cancel any previously scheduled annual meeting of Shareholders. 
 Section 2. Special Meetings .

 In the case of a special meeting governed by Section 21-254(a)(2) of the Nebraska Model Business Corporation Act (or any successor provision), a Shareholder seeking to demand a special meeting shall first request that the Board of Directors fix a record date to determine the Shareholders entitled to demand a special meeting (the Ownership Record Date by delivering notice in writing to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation (the Record Date Request Notice ).
