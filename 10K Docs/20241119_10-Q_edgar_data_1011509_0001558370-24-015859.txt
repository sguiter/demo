 GOLDEN MINERALS COMPANY NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Expressed in United States dollars) (Unaudited) per share, at a ratio of one-for- 25 shares and a reduction in the total number of authorized shares of common stock of the Company from shares to shares (the Authorized Shares Reduction ), each effective as of June 9, 2023. To effect the Reverse Stock Split and the Authorized Shares Reduction, the Company filed an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 30, 2023. Accordingly, all share and per share data (including share and per share information related to share-based compensation and outstanding warrants), number of shares outstanding, and other common stock equivalents for the periods presented in the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. million, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately million. On the same date, we had accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately million, which includes million in deferred revenue for the sale of the Velarde a oxide plant and water wells recorded within Current liabilities held for sale on the interim Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As previously disclosed, the Company ceased mining at the Velarde a mines in Mexico in the first quarter 2024, and subsequently sold the mines and certain related assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was owed million plus value-added tax VAT of the million purchase price for the Velarde a oxide plant and water wells

Table of Contents 
 million of additional payments for the Velarde a assets, as of November 15, 2024 the Company has cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and accounts payable of approximately million. The Company s only near-term opportunity to generate cash flow to meet its expected cash requirements is from the sale of assets, equity or other external financing. The Company is evaluating and pursuing alternatives, including the potential sale of the Company, finalizing the sale of its assets at the Velarde a Properties and Yoquivo, seeking buyers or partners for the Company s other assets or obtaining equity or other external financing. In the absence of additional cash inflows, the Company anticipates that its cash resources will be exhausted in the second quarter of 2025. If we are unable to obtain additional cash resources or sell the Company, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate. We will require further sources of capital. In order to satisfy the Company s projected general, administrative, exploration and other expenses through September 30, 2025, we will need approximately to million in capital inflows. These capital inflows may take the form of asset sales, equity or other external financing activities, collection of the outstanding amounts due on the sale of the remaining Velarde a Properties and Yoquivo, or from other sources. The Company also continues to evaluate other strategic transactions. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which an entity is considered to be able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business. However, as noted above, our continuing operations will be dependent upon our ability to secure sufficient funding to support future operations. The amounts shown as mineral properties in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements are dependent on our ability to sell certain assets of the Company and receive future equity or other financings to continue to fund general administrative, and exploration activities that would lead to profitable mining and processing activities or to generate proceeds from the disposition of mineral exploration properties. The ability of the Company to maintain a positive cash balance for a period of twelve months beyond the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from the sale of assets, reduction of expenses, collection of VAT accounts receivable from the Mexican government, collection of the amount due from the buyers of the remaining Velarde a Properties and Yoquivo, and to raise sufficient funds through equity or other external financings or from other sources. These material uncertainties cast significant doubt on the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the Company cannot conclude that substantial doubt does not exist as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or liabilities, which might be necessary should the Company not continue as a going concern.

The first sales agreements which include the combined sales of the Velarde a and Chicago mines, the sulfide processing plant and various related equipment were completed on June 20, 2024. The Company received payment in full of million cash, plus VAT, and titles to the assets were transferred to the Buyer. Velarde a Plant 2 The fourth agreement related to the sale of the Velarde a Properties covers the oxide plant and water wells Plant 2 ), and the Buyer agreed to complete total payments of million plus VAT on July 1, 2024. The Plant 2 agreement has not closed, and the Buyer is in default. In accordance with ASC 360, on June 30, 2024, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of in order to write down the remaining book value of Plant 2 to the salvage value which is equal to the amount received through June 30, 2024 from the Buyer of . Since June 30, 2024, the Buyer has continued to make periodic payments to the Company, and as of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded deferred revenue of million within Current liabilities held for sale on the interim Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Buyer has operational control of Plant 2, and we are no longer operating the property. We do not know whether or when the Buyer will make the remaining payments due. We are continuing to negotiate an extension of the agreement which would allow for the transfer of the title of Plant 2 to the Buyer and the Company would hold a mortgage to secure the payment. See Note 19. Minera Labri On August 28, 2024, the Company sold its wholly owned Mexican subsidiary, Minera Labri S.A. de C.V. Minera Labri ), to a private Mexican company for approximately . Minera Labri previously owned the Velarde a Properties sulfide plant, which together with the Velarde a mines, was sold to another privately held Mexican group earlier in 2024. Upon consummation of that transaction, Minera Labri held no assets but held net operating losses and inflation-adjusted capital contributions. Under Mexican law, the balance of Minera Labri s capital contribution accounts CUCAs may be bought and sold. Silex Argentina On August 30, 2024, the Company entered into a binding letter agreement (the Letter Agreement with Butte Energy Inc. Butte pursuant to which Butte would acquire of the issued and outstanding shares of Silex Argentina S.A.

The Company and Unifin agreed to settle the dispute in late 2023. An accrued liability was recorded for the settlement amount of as of December 31, 2023 and for as of March 31, 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, the Court unfroze the Minera William bank accounts, and the bank remitted the funds to Unifin as per the settlement agreement. Subsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company paid Unifin the remaining amount due under the agreement upon settlement. The court published a writ subsequent to March 31, 2024 stating that the parties had complied with the settlement agreement and declared that Unifin has withdrawn the lawsuit against Minera William. On June 13, 2024, the Trial Court published the judgment in the commercial oral proceeding initiated by Unifin against Minera William, Procesadora de Minerales de Durango, and Jorge Alberto Samaniego Mota. Since Unifin and Minera William had previously settled the dispute and Unifin desisted or withdrew its action against Minera William, the company was not condemned in the judgment. Procesadora de Minerales de Durango and Jorge Alberto Samaniego Mota were ordered to pay all the amounts claimed by Unifin. However, the judgment states that Minera William, Procesadora de Minerales de Durango, and Jorge Samaniego Mota are jointly and severally liable to Unifin. The Company believes the Judge should not have ruled on whether or not Minera William was jointly and severally liable. Moreover, the Judge did not assess Minera William s arguments that it was not jointly and severally liable to Unifin. Minera William is appealing that ruling as it is clearly contrary to the settlement agreement between Unifin and Minera William. The Company currently believes that it is unlikely any future liability will arise from this judgement. Employee Labor Claims During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, employees of some of the Company s Mexican subsidiaries filed labor claims against the subsidiary companies claiming the companies had not compensated them properly for their termination. A severance accrual has been estimated and recorded in connection with these lawsuits for .

As of November 15, 2024, the Company is still owed million, plus VAT, of the million purchase price for the Velarde a oxide plant and water wells and other minor remaining Velarde a assets. We do not know whether or when the Buyer will make the remaining payments due. We are continuing to negotiate an extension of the agreement which would allow for the transfer of the title of Plant 2 and the ARO liability to the Buyer and the Company would hold a mortgage to secure the payment.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysi s of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our Company We were incorporated in Delaware in March 2009 under the Delaware General Corporation Law. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our principal source of revenue was from the sale of gold and silver contained in concentrate from our Velarde a Properties in Durango, Mexico. We also had secondary sources of revenue from tolling material at our oxide plant for a third party and selling the Velarde a assets that are held for sale. We incurred net operating losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We restarted mining at our Velarde a Properties in December 2023 and continued through the end of February 2024 when it was determined that the initial performance of both the mine and the plant did not achieve expected results. We processed all the mineralized material that had been mined and shut down the sulfide processing plant at the end of March 2024 and held the Velarde a Properties for short-term sale as we evaluated options to realize value from the assets. We entered into certain sales agreements to sell the Velarde a and Chicago mines, both sulfide and oxide processing plants, water wells, and related equipment of the Velarde a Properties to a privately held Mexican company (the Buyer in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of 5.5 million in cash, plus VAT. There were 4 separate sales agreements. The first three sales agreements which include the combined sales of the Velarde a and Chicago mines, the sulfide processing plant and various related equipment were completed on June 20, 2024 and the titles to the assets have been transferred to the Buyer. The Buyer agreed to pay 3.0 million plus VAT on July 1, 2024, to complete the last sales agreement which covered the oxide processing plant and water wells. The Buyer has made payments of approximately 1.3 million through November 15, 2024 and is currently in default. The Buyer has operational control of the plant, and we are no longer operating the oxide plant. We are uncertain as to when or if additional payments will be received. We are continuing to negotiate an extension of the agreement which would allow for the transfer of title of the oxide plant to the Buyer and the Company would hold a mortgage to secure the payment. The collection of the amount due from the sale may satisfy a portion of our projected capital needs over the next twelve months (see Note 2 above). As previously disclosed, we have completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary, Silex Argentina, which is the sole owner of El Quevar, our advanced exploration property in Argentina, and have entered into an agreement to sell our Yoquivo exploration property in Mexico. We expect the closing of these transactions to satisfy a portion of our projected capital needs over the next twelve months (see Note 2 above). The Company continues to hold an interest in several remaining exploration properties, including Sarita Este/Desierto, a gold-silver-copper exploration project located in northwest Salta Province Argentina and Sand Canyon, an exploration-stage, gold-silver project in northwestern Nevada. Because we have ceased production at the Velarde a Properties, our only near-term opportunity to generate cash flow is from the sale of assets or new sources of debt or equity capital. We are evaluating and pursuing alternatives to obtain funds to continue as a going concern, including the potential sale of the Company, finalizing the sale of its assets at the Velarde a Properties and Yoquivo, seeking buyers or partners for the Company s other assets or obtaining equity or other external financing. In the absence of additional cash inflows, the Company anticipates that its cash resources will be exhausted in the second quarter of 2025. If we are unable to obtain additional cash resources or sell the Company, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate. See Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern 2024 Liquidity Forecast and Going Concern Qualification below. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation included in our 2023 Annual Report. 2024 Highlights Velarde a Properties The Velarde a Properties contain two underground mines. Prior to the recent restart in December 2023, the last time the mines were operated was in late 2015, at which point mining activities were suspended when a combination of low metals prices, mining dilution and metallurgical challenges rendered operations unprofitable. We elected to preserve the asset for future use, and continued to evaluate and test various mining methods and processing alternatives that could enable sustainable profitable operations.

 We restarted mining at Velarde a in December 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, we sold just over 2,000 tonnes of concentrate containing approximately 640 ounces of gold and approximately 21,750 ounces of silver. Mill throughput of mined material totaled 5,186 tonnes over the period of operations in February and March 2024. We stopped mining at the end of February when we determined that the initial performance of the mine and the processing plant had not achieved expected results due to operational issues caused by a combination of insufficient experienced miners, issues with ventilation and issues with aging mining equipment at the mine. We stopped processing the mined material at the end of March 2024. The table below sets forth the key processing and sales statistics for the Velarde a operation for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 

Velarde a Operations Statistics (in thousands except per unit amounts) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 Tonnes mined 1 - 14,961 Tonnes processed - 5,186 Average tonnes per day processed - 185 Gold sold in concentrate (ounces) - 639 Silver sold in concentrate (ounces) - 21,745 Average realized price, before refining and selling costs Gold (dollar per ounce) - 2,077 Silver (dollar per ounce) - 23.82 1 Includes all mined material transported to the plant, stockpiled or designated as waste As noted above, we have entered into sales agreements pursuant to which a third-party has purchased the Velarde a and Chicago mines, mining equipment and the sulfide plant, and agreed to purchase the oxide processing plant and water wells. The Buyer has made payments of approximately 1.3 million for the oxide plant and water wells through November 15, 2024 and is currently in default. The Buyer has operational control of the plant, and we are no longer operating the oxide plant. We are uncertain as to when or if additional payments will be received. Yoquivo On October 25, 2024, we entered into a sales agreement with Advance Metals Limited AVM to sell our Yoquivo exploration property. We hold 100 ownership of the Yoquivo concessions subject to royalty interests between 2 and 3 net smelter return payable on production to third parties and capped at 2.8 million in the aggregate. We have received 295,000 under the sales agreement and will receive an additional 275,000 if the transaction is completed as scheduled in late November. El Quevar In April 2020, we entered into the Earn-in Agreement with Barrick. In March 2024, Barrick notified us that it was withdrawing from the Earn-In Agreement. The termination was effective on April 20, 2024 and the El Quevar project reverted back into the full control of the Company. In October 2024, we completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary, Silex Argentina, which is the sole owner of El Quevar, our advanced exploration property in Argentina, for a purchase price of 3.5 million. Sarita Este / Desierto In December 2019, we entered into an option agreement with Cascadero Minerals Corporation Cascadero to acquire a 51 interest in the gold/copper Sarita Este concession, located in the northwest portion of the Province of Salta, Argentina, adjacent to the Taca Taca project owned by First Quantum Minerals. We have exceeded the drilling requirement and have spent approximately 3.0 million since entering into the agreement in December 2019. After satisfying the 

 22 

Table of Contents 
 drilling and expenditure requirements, we notified Cascadero of our intention to proceed with the joint venture as 51 owners of the concession. Completion of the joint venture documents and formation of the joint venture company are in progress. Information regarding the drilling completed to date is included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Desierto concessions (Desierto 1 and 2) which are adjacent to and south of the Sarita Este concession, are subject to an option agreement with a third-party partial owner and a proposed joint venture agreement also between the Company and Cascadero. The Desierto 1 concession was the object of a legal dispute between the Company and the Salta Ministry of Mines in which the Company was disputing the cancellation of the concession by the province. On August 28, 2024, the judges of the Court of Appeals of Salta (i) accepted the Company s appeal, (ii) revoked the Mining Court s resolutions of cancellation and (iii) ordered the restitution to the Company of the Desierto I mining concession. Financial Results of Operations For the results of operations discussed below, we compare the results from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operations did not produce concentrate during the three months ended September 30, 2024, but revenue was recorded during the third quarter on several of the Velarde a concentrate shipments completed earlier in 2024 that were finalized during the quarter. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, all of the operating activity related to the Rodeo property. Mining at Rodeo concluded in August 2023 as the ore was depleted as expected. Processing of the Rodeo stockpiles concluded in September 2023. Due to the discontinuation of the mining and sulfide processing operations of the Velarde a Properties at the end of March 2024, the Velarde a properties were classified as assets held for sale, and therefore, in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2024, the asset values, revenues and expenditures of these discontinued operations have been presented as Assets Held for Sale, Liabilities Held for Sale, and Discontinued Operations (see Note 3 above). The revenues and costs discussed below are the amounts recorded prior to the reclassification of those items. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Revenue from the sale of metals. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 0.1 million revenue from the sale of metal relating to concentrate shipments completed earlier in 2024 that were finalized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 2.5 million from the sale of metal. The Rodeo operations sold mainly dor . We also sold slag remaining from previous dor sales and dor production at the Velarde a Plant 2, and some concentrates produced from material previously stockpiled when test mining at the Velarde a mine. Dor Sales - We recorded no revenue related to gold and silver in d or for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Concentrate Sales We recorded 0.1 million of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the final settlement of previously shipped Velarde a gold-rich pyrite concentrate, silver-rich lead concentrate and zinc concentrate. We recorded 0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 from the final settlement of previously shipped gold-rich pyrite concentrate, silver-rich lead concentrate and zinc concentrate that were produced from mineralized material which had been mined in 2022 as part of the test mining to analyze the potential restart of the Velarde a Properties. Slag and Other Sales We recorded zero revenue related to slag and other material during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded approximately 0.2 million in revenue related to the gold and silver in slag that was sold to a refiner in the United States in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of metals sold. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded 0.6 million and 3.3 million of cost of metals sold, respectively. Exploration expense. Our exploration expense, including property holding costs and allocated administrative expenses, totaled 0.4 million and 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 The lower exploration expense for 2024 is primarily related to less activity in 2024 due to the cash constraints of the Company. Velarde a care and maintenance costs . We recorded no expenses related to care and maintenance at our Velarde a Properties for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as the Velarde a Properties were discontinued during that period and have either been sold or are being held for sale. We recorded 0.3 million related to care and maintenance for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. El Quevar project expense . We incurred 0.2 million and 0.1 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to holding and evaluation costs for the Yaxtch deposit at our El Quevar project in Argentina. Because the Barrick agreement had been terminated in April 2024, there were zero reimbursements from Barrick during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended 2023, approximately 0.0 million of costs actually incurred were offset by reimbursements from Barrick. Administrative expense. Administrative expenses totaled 0.8 million and 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Administrative expenses, including costs associated with being a public company, are incurred primarily by our corporate activities in support of the Yoquivo Property, Rodeo Property, Velarde a Properties, El Quevar project and our exploration portfolio. Stock-based compensation. During each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred approximately 0.1 million of expense related to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation varies from period to period depending on the number and timing of shares granted, the type of grant, the market value of the shares on the date of grant and other variables. Reclamation and accretion expense. During each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred approximately 0.1 million of reclamation expense related to the accretion of an asset retirement obligation at the Velarde a and Rodeo properties. Other operating income (loss), net. We recorded 1.6 million of net other operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to the sale of Silex Argentina and Minera Labri. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 0.5 million of net other operating income. Depreciation, depletion and amortization. We recorded nominal depreciation, depletion and amortization expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded approximately 0.1 million for depreciation, depletion and amortization expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest and other expense, net. We recorded a nominal amount of interest and other expense, net for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. (Loss) gain on foreign currency losses. We recorded a nominal amount of foreign currency gains during each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Foreign currency gains and losses are primarily related to the effect of currency fluctuations on monetary transactions incurred by our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Income taxes. We recorded a zero tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded a zero income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Revenue from the sale of metals. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, all revenue was generated from the Velarde a properties. The Velarde a operations produced three types of concentrate before operations terminated in March 2024, and also generated revenue from slag sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Rodeo operations sold mainly dor . We also sold slag remaining from previous dor sales and dor production at Plant 2. Dor Sales - We recorded no revenue related to gold and silver in d or for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Concentrate Sales We recorded 1.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the sale of gold-rich pyrite concentrate, silver-rich lead concentrate and zinc concentrate. We recorded 1.7 million from the sales of concentrate in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Slag and Other Sales We recorded approximately 30,000 in revenue related to the gold and silver in precipitate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from scrap and trace material removed from Plants I and II during the clean out process following the cessation of operations in 2024. We recorded approximately 0.5 million in revenue related to the gold and silver in slag that was sold to a refiner in the United States in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of metals sold. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded 6.0 million and 11.2 million of cost of metals sold, respectively. Lower costs in 2024 compared to 2023 were due primarily to lower mining costs as mining was discontinued at the end of February 2024, and lower processing costs, as the processing of sulfide material was discontinued at the end of March 2024. Exploration expense. Our exploration expense, including property holding costs and allocated administrative expenses, totaled 1.2 million and 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower exploration expense for 2024 is primarily related to less activity in 2024 due to the cash constraints of the Company. Velarde a care and maintenance costs . We recorded no expenses related to care and maintenance at our Velarde a Properties for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as the Velarde a Properties were operating during that period and have either been sold or are now being held for sale. We recorded 0.9 million related to care and maintenance for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, respectively, for expenses related to care and maintenance at our Velarde a Properties as the result of the previous suspension of mining and processing activities in November 2015. El Quevar project expense. We recorded 0.4 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

Stock-based compensation. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred approximately 0.3 million of expense related to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation varies from period to period depending on the number and timing of shares granted, the type of grant, the market value of the shares on the date of grant and other variables. Reclamation and accretion expense. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we incurred approximately 0.2 million of reclamation expense, related to the accretion of an asset retirement obligation at the Velarde a and Rodeo properties. Other operating income (loss), net. We recorded 3.3 million of net other operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to the sale of a portion of the Velarde a assets, Silex Argentina and Minera Labri. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 0.6 million of net other operating income primarily related to the sale of non-core assets. Depreciation, depletion and amortization. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of approximately 0.2 million and 0.4 million respectively. Interest and other expense, net. We recorded a nominal amount of interest and other expense, net for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. (Loss) gain on foreign currency losses.

Table of Contents 
 currency fluctuations on monetary transactions incurred by our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Income taxes. We recorded a zero tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded less than 1,000 of tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern 2024 Liquidity Forecast and Going Concern Qualification We do not currently have sufficient resources to meet our expected cash needs during the twelve months ending September 30, 2025. At September 30, 2024, we had current assets of approximately 2.5 million, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1.8 million. On the same date, we had accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately 4.5 million, which includes 1.0 million in deferred revenue for the sale of the Velarde a oxide plant and water wells recorded within Current liabilities held for sale on the interim Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As previously disclosed, the Company ceased mining at the Velarde a mines in Mexico in the first quarter 2024, and subsequently sold the mines and certain related assets. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Plant 2 Buyer made additional payments of approximately 0.3 million bringing the total amounts paid through November 15, 2024 to approximately 1.3 million, but the Buyer remains in default. As of November 15, 2024, the Company is still owed 1.7 million plus VAT of the 3.0 million purchase price for the Velarde a oxide plant and water wells and other minor remaining Velarde a assets. We do not know whether or when the Buyer will make the remaining payments due. We are continuing to negotiate an extension of the agreement which would allow for the transfer of the title of Plant 2 and the ARO liability to the Buyer and the Company would hold a mortgage to secure the payment. With the receipt of the proceeds from the sale of Silex Argentina and the cash payments received to date for the Yoquivo Transaction, as of November 15, 2024 the Company has cash and cash equivalents of approximately 3.6 million and accounts payable of approximately 1.2 million. The Company s only near-term opportunity to generate cash flow to meet its expected cash requirements is from the sale of assets, equity or other external financing. The Company is evaluating and pursuing alternatives, including the potential sale of the Company, finalizing the sale of its assets at the Velarde a Properties and Yoquivo, seeking buyers or partners for the Company s other assets or obtaining equity or other external financing. In the absence of additional cash inflows, the Company anticipates that its cash resources will be exhausted in the second quarter of 2025. If we are unable to obtain additional cash resources or sell the Company, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate. We will require further sources of capital. In order to satisfy the Company s projected general, administrative, exploration and other expenses through September 30, 2025, we will need approximately 1.5 to 3.5 million in capital inflows. These capital inflows may take the form of asset sales, equity or other external financing activities, collection of the outstanding amounts due on the sale of the remaining Velarde a Properties and Yoquivo, or from other sources. The Company also continues to evaluate other strategic transactions. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which an entity is considered to be able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business. However, as noted above, our continuing operations will be dependent upon our ability to secure sufficient funding to support future operations. The amounts shown as mineral properties in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements are dependent on our ability to sell certain assets of the Company and receive future equity or other financings to continue to fund general administrative, and exploration activities that would lead to profitable mining and processing activities or to generate proceeds from the disposition of mineral exploration properties. The ability of the Company to maintain a positive cash balance for a period of twelve months beyond the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from the sale of assets, reduction of expenses, collection of VAT accounts receivable from the Mexican government, collection of the amount due from the buyers of the remaining Velarde a Properties and Yoquivo, and to raise sufficient funds through equity or other external financings or from other sources. These material uncertainties cast significant doubt on the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the Company cannot conclude that substantial doubt does not exist as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and

 classification of recorded assets or liabilities, which might be necessary should the Company not continue as a going concern. 2024 Liquidity Discussion At September 30, 2024, our aggregate cash and cash equivalents totaled 1.8 million, compared to the 3.8 million in similar assets held at December 31, 2023. The September 30, 2024 decrease is the result of the following expenditures and cash inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

NYSE American Continued Listing Standards As previously disclosed, on June 6, 2023, we received written notification (the Notice from the NYSE American LLC (the NYSE American that the Company was not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the Company Guide ). We are required to report a stockholders equity of 6.0 million or more if the Company has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in our five most recent fiscal years. The Notice noted that the Company reported a stockholders equity of 4.1 million as of March 31, 2023, and losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in each of its five most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2022. As a result, we have become subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the Company Guide and were required to submit a plan of compliance by July 6, 2023, addressing how the Company intends to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide.

 not make progress consistent with the Plan during the Plan period, we expect the NYSE American to initiate delisting proceedings. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There were no new accounting pronouncements issued during the third quarter of 2024 that would affect the Company or have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Forward-Looking Statements Some information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other applicable securities laws. These statements include comments relating to: (i) our anticipated near-term capital needs, and potential sources of capital; (ii) our plans for, and timing of, the sale of our Velarde a oxide plant and water wells, (iii) our plans to sell tax credits held in our Mexican operating companies; (iv) closing the sale of the Yoquivo property; (v) expectations pertaining to the recovery of VAT refunds from the Mexican government; (vi) projected funding and spending for the twelve months ending June 30, 2025; (vii) the NYSE American staff initiating delisting proceedings against the Company if it is not in compliance with the NYSE American s continued listing standards by the Compliance Deadline and (viii) statements concerning our financial condition, business strategies and business and legal risks and our financial outlook for 2024, including anticipated expenditures and cash inflows during the year. We use the words anticipate, continue, likely, estimate, expect, may, believe, will, project, should, could, believe and similar expressions (including negative and grammatical variations) to identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations and assumptions reflected in those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that these expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements as a result of the factors set forth below and other factors set forth in, or incorporated by reference into this report: whether we are able to raise the necessary capital or otherwise enter into another strategic transaction that would enable us to continue our business; whether our proposed sale of the Velarde a oxide plant and water wells is consummated; whether we are able to close the sale of the Yoquivo property; whether we continue to be listed on the NYSE American; higher than anticipated care and maintenance costs in Mexico ; decreases in silver and gold prices; risks related to our exploration properties, including unfavorable results from exploration and whether we will be able to advance our exploration properties; whether we will be able begin to mine and sell minerals successfully or profitably at any of our current properties at current or future silver and gold prices and achieve our objective of becoming a mid-tier mining company; potential delays in our exploration activities or other activities to advance properties towards mining resulting from environmental consents or permitting delays or problems, accidents, problems with contractors, disputes under agreements related to exploration properties, unanticipated costs and other unexpected events; our ability to retain key management and mining personnel necessary to successfully operate and grow our business; economic and political events negatively affecting the market prices for gold, silver, zinc, lead and other minerals that may be found on our exploration properties;

 political and economic instability in Mexico, Argentina, and other countries in which we conduct our business, and future actions of any of these governments with respect to nationalization of natural resources or other changes in mining or taxation policies; volatility in the market price of our common stock; and the factors discussed under Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the general or specific factors that could affect us. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such expectations may prove to be materially incorrect due to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. You should not unduly rely on any of our forward-looking statements. These statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Ris k Interest Rate Risk We invest substantially all of our excess cash in U.S. government and debt securities rated investment grade or better. The rates received on such investments may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions. Based on the average cash and investment balances outstanding during the first nine months of 2024, a 1 decrease in interest rates would have resulted in only a nominal reduction in interest income for the period. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Although most of our expenditures are in U.S. dollars, certain purchases of labor, supplies and capital assets are denominated in other currencies, primarily in Mexico. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs of our exploration and mining activities. To reduce this risk, we maintain minimum cash balances in foreign currencies and complete most of our purchases in U.S. dollars. Commodity Price Risk We are primarily engaged in the exploration and mining of properties containing gold, silver, zinc, lead and other minerals. As a result, decreases in the price of any of these metals have the potential to negatively impact our ability to establish reserves and mine on our properties. We currently hold no commodity derivative positions. Item 4. Controls and Procedure s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024, (the Evaluation Date ). Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATIO N Item 1. Legal Proceeding s. Unifin Lawsuit During April 2021, the Company became aware of a lawsuit in Mexico against one of the Company s Mexican subsidiaries, Minera William, S.A. de C.V. Minera William ). The plaintiff in the matter was Unifin Financiera, S.A.B de C.V. Unifin ). The lawsuit was assigned to the Fifth Specialized Commercial District Court. In November 2022, the Company was formally served with the complaint in connection with the lawsuit and in December 2022 the Company filed its answer to the complaint. As a preemptive measure, Unifin obtained a preliminary court order freezing Minera William s bank accounts in Mexico, which limited the Company s and Minera William s ability to access approximately US 153,000 according to current currency exchange rates. The Company and Unifin agreed to settle the dispute in late 2023. An accrued liability was recorded for the settlement amount of 250,000 as of December 31, 2023 and for 113,000 as of March 31, 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, the Court unfroze the Minera William bank accounts, and the bank remitted the funds to Unifin as per the settlement agreement. Subsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company paid Unifin the remaining amount due under the agreement upon settlement. The court published a writ subsequent to March 31, 2024 stating that the parties had complied with the settlement agreement and declared that Unifin has withdrawn the lawsuit against Minera William. On June 13, 2024, the Trial Court published the judgment in the commercial oral proceeding initiated by Unifin against Minera William, Procesadora de Minerales de Durango, and Jorge Alberto Samaniego Mota. Since Unifin and Minera William had previously settled the dispute and Unifin desisted or withdrew its action against Minera William, the company was not condemned in the judgment. Procesadora de Minerales de Durango and Jorge Alberto Samaniego Mota were ordered to pay all the amounts claimed by Unifin. However, the judgment states that Minera William, Procesadora de Minerales de Durango, and Jorge Samaniego Mota are jointly and severally liable to Unifin. The Company believes the Judge should not have ruled on whether or not Minera William was jointly and severally liable. Moreover, the Judge did not assess Minera William s arguments that it was not jointly and severally liable to Unifin. Minera William is appealing that ruling as it is clearly contrary to the settlement agreement between Unifin and Minera William. The Company currently believes that it is unlikely any future liability will arise from this judgement. Employee Labor Claims During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 16 employees of some of the Company s Mexican subsidiaries filed labor claims against the subsidiary companies claiming the companies had not compensated them properly for their termination. A severance accrual has been estimated and recorded in connection with these lawsuits for 230,000. Supplier Lawsuits During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, four suppliers of some of the Mexican subsidiaries filed lawsuits against the subsidiary companies for non-payment of services rendered. In total, the four suppliers are seeking approximately 214,000 and this amount is recorded in accounts payable as of September 30, 2024. Item 1A. Risk Factor s The risk factors for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are substantially the same as those set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
