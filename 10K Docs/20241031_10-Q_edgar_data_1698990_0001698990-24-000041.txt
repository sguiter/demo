For further detail, see Note 11 Stock Based Compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

 Restricted Stock Units 
 
 The Company grants service-based RSU awards to employees, which generally vest and settle ratably over a or service period, and to non-employee directors, which vest in full after . Non-employee directors may elect to defer the RSU settlement date. RSUs represent the right to receive shares of Class A Common Stock at the end of the vesting period equal to the number of RSUs that vest. RSUs are subject to restrictions on transfer and are generally subject to a risk of forfeiture if the award recipient ceases to be an employee or director of the Company prior to vesting of the award. Compensation expense for the service-based RSU awards is based upon the grant date market value of the award and such costs are recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards. The aggregate fair value of RSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million and million, respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs as of September 30, 2024 was million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of years. 
 
 Performance Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units 
 
 The Company grants PRSUs to certain employees. Each PRSU represents the contingent right to receive share of Class A Common Stock once the PRSU is both vested and earned. PRSUs generally vest and settle either ratably over a service period or at the end of a service period, in each case, subject to the recipient s continued employment or service through each applicable vesting date. Each PRSU is earned based on whether Magnolia s stock price achieves a target average stock price for any consecutive trading days during the performance period Performance Condition ). If PRSUs are not earned by the end of the performance period, the PRSUs will be forfeited and no shares of Class A Common Stock will be issued, even if the vesting conditions have been met. Compensation expense for the PRSU awards is based upon grant date fair market value of the award, calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation, as presented below, and such costs are recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards, as applicable. The aggregate fair value of PRSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million and million, respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested PRSUs as of September 30, 2024 was million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of years. 
 
 The Company grants PSUs to certain employees. Each PSU, to the extent earned, represents the contingent right to receive share of Class A Common Stock and the awardee may earn between and of the target number of PSUs granted based on the total shareholder return TSR of the Class A Common Stock relative to the TSR achieved by a specific industry peer group over a performance period. In addition to the TSR conditions, vesting of the PSUs is subject to the awardee s continued employment through the date of settlement of the PSUs, which will occur within days following the end of the performance period. The aggregate fair value of PSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million and million, respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested PSUs as of September 30, 2024 was million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of years.

 Overview 
 
 Magnolia Oil Gas Corporation (the Company or Magnolia is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration, and production of oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves that operates in one reportable segment located in the United States. The Company s oil and natural gas properties are located primarily in the Karnes and Giddings areas in South Texas, where the Company targets the Eagle Ford Shale and the Austin Chalk formations. Magnolia s objective is to generate stock market value over the long term through consistent organic production growth, high full cycle operating margins, an efficient capital program with short economic paybacks, significant free cash flow after capital expenditures, and effective reinvestment of free cash flow. The Company s allocation of capital prioritizes reinvesting in its business to achieve moderate and predictable annual volume growth and remains balanced with returning capital to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
 
 Magnolia s business model prioritizes prudent and disciplined capital allocation, free cash flow, and financial stability. The Company s ongoing plan is to spend within cash flow on drilling and completing wells while maintaining low financial leverage. The Company s gradual and measured approach toward the development of the Giddings area has created operating efficiencies leading to higher production. 
 
 Market Conditions Update 
 
 Commodity prices experienced significant volatility in recent years, impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war, actions taken by OPEC, and the continued instability and conflict in the Middle East. Global conflict and supply chain disruptions drove high oil and natural gas prices in 2022. Beginning in 2023, due to the easing of global geopolitically driven supply fears along with record high US production, natural gas and NGL prices significantly declined and oil prices weakened. While material and labor costs have flattened, this decline in prices has resulted in lower operating margins. In 2024, despite continued commodity price volatility, lower well costs combined with improved operating efficiencies are allowing for more wells to be drilled, completed, and turned in line helping to support Magnolia's overall high-margin growth from a disciplined capital program. 
 
 Business Overview 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Magnolia s assets in South Texas included 77,278 gross (55,286 net) acres in the Karnes area, and 748,547 gross (554,871 net) acres in the Giddings area. As of September 30, 2024, Magnolia held an interest in approximately 2,647 gross (1,798 net) wells, with total production of 90.7 thousand and 88.6 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

Results of Operations 
 
 Factors Affecting the Comparability of the Historical Financial Results 
 
 Magnolia s historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable, either from period to period or going forward, as a result of the Company s acquisition in November 2023 of certain oil and gas producing properties including leasehold and mineral interests in the Giddings area for approximately 264.1 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, and an additional contingent cash consideration of up to 40.0 million through January 2026 based on future commodity prices. 
 
 As a result of the factors listed above, the historical results of operations and period-to-period comparisons of these results and certain financial data may not be comparable or indicative of future results.

Oil revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 22.1 million higher than for the three months ended September 30, 2023 caused by an 18 increase in oil production that increased revenues by 41.2 million, partially offset by an 8 decrease in average prices that decreased revenues by 19.1 million. Oil revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 94.3 million higher than for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 caused by a 12 increase in oil production that increased revenues by 84.4 million and a 1 increase in average prices that increased revenues by 9.9 million. 
 
 Natural gas revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.9 million lower than the three months ended September 30, 2023 caused by a 19 decrease in average prices that decreased revenues by 5.3 million, partially offset by a 2 increase in natural gas production which increased revenues by 0.4 million. Natural gas revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 13.8 million lower than the nine months ended September 30, 2023 caused by a 23 decrease in average prices that decreased revenues by 17.4 million, partially offset by a 6 increase in natural gas production which increased revenues by 3.6 million. The realized revenue pricing included the impact of gas plant fees that were netted from revenue. 
 
 NGL revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.2 million higher than the three months ended September 30, 2023 caused by a 7 increase in NGL production that increased revenues by 2.8 million, partially offset by a 6 decrease in average prices that decreased revenues by 2.6 million. NGL revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.4 million higher than the nine months ended September 30, 2023 caused by a 9 increase in NGL production which increased revenues by 10.6 million, partially offset by a 5 decrease in average prices that decreased revenues by 6.2 million. 
 
 Operating Expenses and Other Income (Expense). 
 
 The following table summarizes the Company s operating expenses and other income (expense) for the periods indicated. 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (In thousands, except per unit data) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Operating Expenses: Lease operating expenses 44,444 35,893 134,945 115,060 Gathering, transportation and processing 10,676 10,297 27,668 33,419 Taxes other than income 18,269 14,823 56,011 49,331 Exploration expenses 491 5,128 918 5,139 Asset retirement obligations accretion 1,749 875 5,112 2,539 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 107,336 81,158 309,155 228,868 Impairment of oil and natural gas properties 15,735 General and administrative expenses 21,158 19,371 67,547 57,863 Total operating expenses 204,123 167,545 601,356 507,954 Other Income (Expense): Interest income (expense), net (3,856) 1,034 (9,683) 372 Other income (expense), net 7,286 (479) 4,018 7,643 Total other income (expense), net 3,430 555 (5,665) 8,015 Average Operating Costs per boe: Lease operating expenses 5.33 4.72 5.56 5.18 Gathering, transportation and processing 1.28 1.35 1.14 1.51 Taxes other than income 2.19 1.95 2.31 2.22 Exploration expenses 0.06 0.67 0.04 0.23 Asset retirement obligations accretion 0.21 0.12 0.21 0.11 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 12.86 10.67 12.74 10.31 Impairment of oil and natural gas properties 0.71 General and administrative expenses 2.54 2.55 2.78 2.61 
 
 Lease operating expenses are costs incurred in the operation of producing properties, including expenses for utilities, direct labor, water disposal, workover rigs, workover expenses, materials, and supplies. Lease operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 8.6 million, or 0.61 per boe, higher compared to the corresponding 2023 period. Lease operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 19.9 million, or 0.38 per boe, higher compared to the corresponding 2023 
 19 

period. The increases in both periods were due to an increase in chemicals, compression, operating and maintenance costs and payroll expense associated with higher well count and higher workover activity. 
 
 Gathering, transportation and processing costs are costs incurred to deliver oil, natural gas, and NGLs to the market. These expenses can vary based on the volume of oil, natural gas, and NGLs produced as well as the cost of commodity processing. The Company is also party to a number of percent-of-proceeds arrangements that track closely to natural gas and NGL pricing and affect the cost of commodity processing. The gathering, transportation and processing costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.4 million higher, but 0.07 per boe lower, than the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gathering, transportation and processing costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 5.8 million, or 0.37 per boe, lower than the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes in both periods were primarily due to a change in volumes sold under a percent-of-proceeds arrangement, lower natural gas and NGL pricing, and other contractual changes. Costs decreased on a per boe basis due to increased production. 
 
 Taxes other than income include production, ad valorem, and franchise taxes. These taxes are based on rates primarily established by state and local taxing authorities. Production taxes are based on the market value of production. Ad valorem taxes are based on the fair market value of the mineral interests or business assets. Taxes other than income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.4 million, or 0.24 per boe, higher compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Taxes other than income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 6.7 million, or 0.09 per boe, higher compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in both periods was primarily due to an increase in production taxes as a result of the increase in oil and NGL revenues, which was partially offset by the decrease in natural gas revenues. 
 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization DD A during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.2 million, or 2.19 per boe, higher compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. DD A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 80.3 million, or 2.43 per boe, higher compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in both periods was due to increased production and a higher depreciable cost basis. 
 
 General and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.8 million higher, but 0.01 per boe lower, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 9.7 million, or 0.17 per boe, higher when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by increased corporate payroll expenses and other non-recurring costs. 
 
 The Company recognized interest expense, net, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to interest income, net during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change from interest income, net to interest expense, net, for both periods was driven by lower interest income realized during 2024 as a result of lower cash balances. 
 
 Other income, net, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.3 million compared to other expense, net, of 0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The other income in 2024 was due to a gain on revaluation of the contingent consideration liability associated with the acquisition of certain oil and gas properties in the Giddings area acquired during 2023. Other income, net, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.6 million lower than the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the gain on sale of the Company s 84.7 interest in Highlander and an earnout payment associated with the sale of the Company s 35 membership interest in Ironwood Eagle Ford Midstream LLC in the prior year. 
 
 Income tax expense. The following table summarizes the Company s income tax expense for the periods indicated.

 Income tax expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.7 million and 2.0 million lower than the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in tax expense was primarily a result of a decrease in income before income taxes, and additional tax credits, partially offset by an increase in controlling interest. See Note 9 Income Taxes in the notes to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detail.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Magnolia s primary source of liquidity and capital has been its cash flows from operations. The Company s primary uses of cash have been for development of the Company s oil and natural gas properties, returning capital to shareholders, bolt-on acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties, and general working capital needs. 
 
 The Company may also utilize borrowings under other various financing sources available to it, including its RBL Facility and the issuance of equity or debt securities through public offerings or private placements, to fund Magnolia s acquisitions and long-term liquidity needs. Magnolia s ability to complete future offerings of equity or debt securities and the timing of these offerings will depend upon various factors, including prevailing market conditions and the Company s financial condition. The Company anticipates its current cash balance, cash flows from operations, and its available sources of liquidity to be sufficient to meet the Company s cash requirements. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 400.0 million of principal debt related to the 2026 Senior Notes outstanding and no outstanding borrowings related to the RBL Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 726.1 million of liquidity comprised of the 450.0 million of borrowing base capacity of the RBL Facility, and 276.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Magnolia had 276.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. The Company s cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various financial institutions in the United States. Deposits with these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. However, the Company regularly monitors the financial stability of such financial institutions and believes that the Company is not exposed to any significant default risk. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 The following table presents the sources and uses of the Company s cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented:

 Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 
 Operating cash flows are the Company s primary source of liquidity and are impacted, in the short-term and long-term, by oil and natural gas prices. The factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of certain non-cash expenses such as DD A, stock based compensation, amortization of deferred financing costs, revaluation of contingent consideration, impairment of oil and natural gas properties, asset retirement obligations accretion, and deferred taxes. 
 
 21 

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 698.2 million and 608.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by the timing of collections and an increase in production and realized oil prices, partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas and NGL prices. 
 
 Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 Acquisitions 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid 165.0 million for acquisitions, primarily comprised of a 125.0 million acquisition in the Giddings area. The acquisitions were funded with cash on hand. 
 
 Additions to Oil and Natural Gas Properties

 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (In thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Drilling and completion 103,057 104,310 345,406 330,147 Leasehold acquisition costs 1,815 2,358 6,529 1,908 Total capital expenditures 104,872 106,668 351,935 332,055 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, Magnolia was running a two-rig program. The number of operated drilling rigs is largely dependent on commodity prices and the Company s strategy of maintaining spending to accommodate the Company s business model. The Company s ongoing plan is to continue to spend within cash flow on drilling and completing wells while maintaining low financial leverage. 
 
 Capital Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 the Company s board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program of up to 40.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock. The program does not require purchases to be made within a particular time frame and whether the Company undertakes these additional repurchases is ultimately subject to numerous considerations, market conditions, and other factors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased 5.3 million and 7.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately 127.0 million and 152.9 million, respectively. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Magnolia LLC repurchased and subsequently canceled 3.5 million Magnolia LLC Units with an equal number of shares of corresponding Class B Common Stock for 89.7 million of cash consideration. As of September 30, 2024, Magnolia owned approximately 97.2 of the interest in Magnolia LLC and the noncontrolling interest was approximately 2.8 . 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company declared and paid cash dividends to holders of its Class A Common Stock totaling 72.5 million. Additionally, 7.1 million was distributed to the Magnolia LLC Unit Holders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company declared cash dividends to holders of its Class A Common Stock totaling 66.3 million. During the same time period, cash paid for dividends was 66.5 million, inclusive of dividends on vested non-participating securities. Additionally, 7.5 million was distributed to the Magnolia LLC Unit Holders. The amount and frequency of future dividends is subject to the discretion of the Company s board of directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants, and various other factors. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 For variable rate debt, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt, but do impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. The Company is subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on borrowings under the RBL Facility. Interest on borrowings under the RBL Facility is based on the SOFR rate or alternative base rate plus an applicable margin. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the RBL Facility. 
 22 

Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Magnolia s primary market risk exposure is to the prices it receives for its oil, natural gas, and NGL production. The prices the Company ultimately realizes for its oil, natural gas, and NGLs are based on a number of variables, including prevailing index prices attributable to the Company s production and certain differentials to those index prices. Pricing for oil, natural gas, and NGLs has historically been volatile and unpredictable, and this volatility is expected to continue in the future. The prices the Company receives for production depend on factors outside of its control, including physical markets, supply and demand, financial markets, and national and international policies. A 1.00 per barrel increase (decrease) in the weighted average oil price for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have increased (decreased) the Company s revenues by approximately 13.9 million on an annualized basis and a 0.10 per Mcf increase (decrease) in the weighted average natural gas price for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have increased (decreased) the Company s revenues by approximately 5.8 million on an annualized basis. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, Magnolia has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including Magnolia s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, Magnolia s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by it in reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

 See Part I, Item 1, Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Please refer to Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ), and Part I, Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on Magnolia s business, results of operations, or financial condition. There have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors since its 2023 Form 10-K. Additional risk factors not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair its business, results of operations, or financial condition.
