 Based on current facts and circumstances, the unrealized losses presented in the September 30, 2024 securities in the gross unrealized loss position table above are not indicative of the ultimate collectability of the current amortized cost of the securities, but rather are primarily attributable to changes in risk-free interest rates. In reaching this determination, the volatility in risk-free rates and credit spreads, as well as the fact that the unrealized losses are concentrated in investment grade issuers, were considered. Additionally, there is no current intent to sell securities with unrealized losses, nor is it more likely than not that sale will be required prior to recovery of amortized cost; accordingly, it was determined that there are additional impairment losses to be recorded as of September 30, 2024.

billion of net A EP claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves were ceded to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of billion. The billion of claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves ceded to NICO was net of billion of ceded claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves under existing third party reinsurance contracts. The NICO LPT aggregate reinsurance limit also covers credit risk on the existing third party reinsurance related to these liabilities. NICO was paid a reinsurance premium of billion and billed third party reinsurance receivables related to A EP claims with a net book value of million were transferred to NICO, resulting in total consideration of billion. 
 
 In years subsequent to the effective date of the LPT, adverse prior year development on A EP reserves was recognized resulting in additional amounts ceded under the LPT. As a result, the cumulative amounts ceded under the LPT have exceeded the billion consideration paid, resulting in the NICO LPT moving into a gain position, requiring retroactive reinsurance accounting. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, this gain is deferred and only recognized in earnings in proportion to actual paid recoveries under the LPT. Over the life of the contract, there is no economic impact as long as any additional losses incurred are within the limit of the LPT. In a period in which a change in the estimate of A EP reserves is recognized that increases or decreases the amounts ceded under the LPT, the proportion of actual paid recoveries to total

 NICO established a collateral trust account as security for its obligations under the LPT. The fair value of the collateral trust account was billion as of September 30, 2024. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. guaranteed the payment obligations of NICO up to the aggregate reinsurance limit as well as certain of NICO s performance obligations under the trust agreement. NICO is responsible for claims handling and billing and collection from third-party reinsurers related to A EP claims. 
 
 Credit Risk for Ceded Reserves 
 
 The majority of CNA s outstanding voluntary reinsurance receivables are due from reinsurers with financial strength ratings of A- or higher. Receivables due from reinsurers with lower financial strength ratings are primarily due from captive reinsurers and are backed by collateral arrangements.

 million of the Plan s defined benefit pension obligations. The group annuity contract covers approximately Plan participants and beneficiaries (the Transferred Participants ), representing approximately of the Plan s obligations. Under the group annuity contract, the Insurer has made an irrevocable commitment, and will be solely responsible, to pay the pension benefits of each Transferred Participant that are due on and after January 1, 2025. The purchase of the group annuity contract was funded directly by assets of the Plan and required no cash or asset contributions from CNA. As a result of the transaction, the Company will recognize a one-time non-cash pretax pension settlement charge of approximately million million after tax and noncontrolling interests) in the fourth quarter of 2024. This charge is largely driven by the accelerated recognition of the actuarial pension loss from Accumulated other comprehensive income into Net income, which does not impact Shareholders equity. This charge will not impact cash flow for the fourth quarter or full year 2024.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Consolidated Financial Results 
 
 The following table summarizes net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation by segment and the basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Loews Corporation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions, except per share data) CNA Financial 259 235 860 758 Boardwalk Pipelines 77 49 268 191 Loews Hotels Co (8) 17 43 115 Corporate 73 (48) 56 (76) Net income attributable to Loews Corporation 401 253 1,227 988 Basic net income per share 1.83 1.12 5.55 4.32 Diluted net income per share 1.82 1.12 5.54 4.31 
 
 Net income attributable to Loews Corporation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 401 million, or 1.82 per share, compared to net income of 253 million, or 1.12 per share in the comparable 2023 period. Net income attributable to Loews Corporation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,227 million, or 5.54 per share, compared to net income of 988 million, or 4.31 per share in the comparable 2023 period. Corporate includes a 37 million after-tax charge for the termination of a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Loews Hotels Co includes a 36 million after-tax gain related to the acquisition of an additional equity interest in, and the consolidation of, a previously unconsolidated joint venture property for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The increase in net income attributable to Loews Corporation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the comparable 2023 period was primarily driven by higher net income at CNA and Boardwalk Pipelines, and higher investment income at the parent company, partially offset by lower results at Loews Hotels Co. The increase at CNA is primarily due to higher net investment income, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses, and the increase at Boardwalk Pipelines is primarily due to increased revenues from re-contracting at higher rates and recently completed growth projects. Higher investment income at the parent company is primarily due to the favorable change in the fair value of equity based investments. Loews Hotels Co s results decreased primarily due to an impairment charge recorded by a joint venture property. 
 
 Results drivers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the comparable 2023 period are consistent with the three-month period discussed above.

 CNA s commercial property and casualty insurance operations Property Casualty Operations include its Specialty, Commercial and International lines of business. CNA s Other Insurance Operations outside of Property Casualty Operations include its long-term care business that is in run-off, certain corporate expenses, including interest on CNA s corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty businesses in run-off, including CNA Re, asbestos and environmental pollution A EP ), a legacy portfolio of excess workers compensation EWC policies and certain legacy mass tort reserves. We believe the presentation of CNA as one reportable segment is appropriate in accordance with applicable accounting standards on segment reporting. However, for purposes of this discussion and analysis of the results

Table of contents 

 of operations, we provide greater detail with respect to CNA s Property Casualty Operations and Other Insurance Operations to enhance the reader s understanding and to provide further transparency into key drivers of CNA s financial results. 
 
 In assessing its insurance operations, CNA utilizes the core income (loss) financial measure. Core income (loss) is calculated by excluding investment gains or losses and gains or losses resulting from pension settlement transactions from net income (loss). In addition, core income (loss) excludes the effects of noncontrolling interests. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes investment gains or losses because they are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily reflective of CNA s primary insurance operations. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes gains or losses resulting from pension settlement transactions as they result from decisions regarding CNA s defined benefit pension plans which are unrelated to its primary insurance operations. Core income (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure and management believes some investors may find this measure useful to evaluate CNA s insurance operations. Please see the non-GAAP reconciliation of net income (loss) to core income (loss) in this MD A. 
 
 In evaluating the results of Property Casualty Operations, which is comprised of the Specialty, Commercial and International lines of business, CNA utilizes the loss ratio, the underlying loss ratio, the expense ratio, the dividend ratio, the combined ratio and the underlying combined ratio. These ratios are calculated using GAAP financial results. The loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The underlying loss ratio excludes the impact of catastrophe losses and development-related items from the loss ratio. Development-related items represent net prior year loss reserve and premium development, and includes the effects of interest accretion and change in allowance for uncollectible reinsurance and deductible amounts. The expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders dividends incurred to net earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios. The underlying combined ratio is the sum of the underlying loss ratio, the expense ratio and the dividend ratio. The underlying loss ratio and the underlying combined ratio are deemed to be non-GAAP financial measures, and management believes some investors may find these ratios useful to evaluate CNA s underwriting performance since they remove the impact of catastrophe losses which are unpredictable as to timing and amount, and development-related items as they are not indicative of current year underwriting performance. 
 
 Changes in estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance, for prior years are defined as net prior year loss reserve development within this MD A. These changes can be favorable or unfavorable. Net prior year loss reserve development does not include the effect of any related acquisition expenses. Further information on CNA s reserves is provided in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included under Item 1 of this Report. 
 
 In addition, renewal premium change, rate, retention and new business are also utilized in evaluating operating trends. Renewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes. Rate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change. Exposure represents the measure of risk used in the pricing of the insurance product. The change in exposure represents the change in premium dollars on policies that renew as a result of the change in risk of the policy. Retention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed, excluding rate and exposure changes, in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew. New business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers. Gross written premiums, excluding third-party captives, excludes business which is ceded to third-party captives, including business related to large warranty programs. 
 
 CNA uses underwriting gain (loss), calculated using GAAP financial results, to monitor insurance operations. Underwriting gain (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP measure and is calculated pretax as net earned premiums less total insurance expenses, which includes insurance claims and policyholders benefits, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and other insurance related expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes some investors may find this measure useful to evaluate the profitability, before tax, derived from CNA s underwriting activities which are managed separately from its investing activities. Underlying underwriting gain (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP measure that represents pretax underwriting gain (loss) excluding catastrophe losses and development-related items. Management believes some investors may find this measure useful to evaluate profitability, before tax, of CNA s underwriting activities, excluding the impact of catastrophe losses which are unpredictable as to timing and amount, and development-related items as they are not indicative of CNA s current year underwriting performance. 
 
 The following tables present a reconciliation of net income attributable to Loews Corporation to core income (loss), underwriting gain (loss) and underlying underwriting gain (loss) for t he three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Other Insurance Operations 
 
 The following table summarizes the results of CNA s Other Insurance Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Comparable 2023 Period 
 
 Core results for Other Insurance Operations improved 9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 period, primarily due to higher net investment income, partially offset by 3 million after tax lower amortization of the deferred gain related to the A EP loss portfolio transfer LPT and a 3 million after tax charge related to an office consolidation in the 2024 period. Both periods are inclusive of assumption updates as a result of the annual long-term care reserve reviews completed in the third quarter of each year. 
 
 The cash flow assumption updates from the annual reserve review for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 resulted in a pretax increase in long-term care reserves of 15 million and 8 million. 
 
 The annual structured settlement reserve review resulted in a pretax reduction in claim reserves of 9 million and 6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 
 The current and prior year third quarters include 17 million and 16 million after tax charges related to unfavorable net prior year loss reserve development largely associated with legacy mass tort abuse claims. Further information on the A EP LPT and net prior year loss reserve development is included in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included under Item 1 of this Report. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Comparable 2023 Period 
 
 Core results for Other Insurance Operations improved 25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 period, the drivers of which are generally consistent with the three month summary above, including a 13 million after tax charge related to an office consolidation in the 2024 period. 
 
 Future Policy Benefit Reserves 
 
 Annually in the third quarter, an actuarial analysis is performed on policyholder morbidity, persistency, premium rate increases and expense experience. This analysis, combined with judgment, informs the setting of updated cash flow assumptions used to estimate the liability for future policyholder benefits LFPB ). For further information on the long-term care reserving process see Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The table below summarizes the estimated pretax impact on CNA s results of operations from various hypothetical revisions to its LFPB reserve assumptions. CNA has assumed that revisions to such assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each long-term care product. The impact of each sensitivity is discrete and does not reflect the impact one factor may have on another or the mitigating impact from management actions, which may include additional future premium rate increases. Although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, CNA believes they could occur based on past variances in experience and its expectations of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur. Any actual adjustment would be dependent on the specific policies affected and, therefore, may differ from the estimates summarized below. The estimated impacts to results of operations in the table below are after consideration of any net premium ratio impacts.

 As part of the annual reserve reviews, statutory long-term care reserve adequacy is evaluated by premium deficiency testing, by comparing carried statutory reserves with best-estimate reserves, which incorporates best estimate discount rate and liability assumptions in its determination. Statutory margin is the excess of carried reserves over best estimate reserves. As of September 30, 2024, statutory long-term care margin increased to 1.4 billion from 1.3 billion, primarily driven by a more favorable interest rate environment resulting in a higher yielding investment portfolio.

 Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation decreased 25 million and 72 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 periods primarily due to the reasons discussed below. 
 
 Operating revenues improved by 35 million and 100 million and operating expenses increased by 22 million and 74 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 periods. The increas e in operating revenues and operating expenses was primarily driven by the opening of the Loews Arlington Hotel and Convention Center in the first quarter of 2024. Operating revenues also improved due to higher occupancy levels at many city center hotels as a result of the continued recovery in group travel in 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 periods and an increase in food and beverage revenues. Operating expenses also increased due to increased staffing costs and higher insurance expenses. Consolidating the results of a property previously accounted for under the equity method also contributed to the improvement in operating revenues and the increase in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 period. 
 
 The nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes a gain of 46 million 36 million after tax) related to the acquisition of an additional equity interest in, and the consolidation of, a previously unconsolidated joint venture property . 
 
 Equity income from joint ventures decreased 26 million and 39 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 periods. The decrease was primarily driven by an impairment charge recorded at a joint venture property which reduced Loews Hotels Co s equity income by 19 million. Separately, a reduction in overall occupancy levels at many joint venture hotels, particularly at the Universal Orlando Resort, in 2024 compared to 2023 also led to a decrease in equity income from joint ventures in both periods. In addition, expenses at joint venture properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to the comparable 2023 period, largely due to increased staffing costs, as well as higher insurance expenses and property taxes. 
 
 The nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes impairment charges of 9 million to reduce the carrying value of certain assets to their estimated fair value. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 6 million and 18 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 pe riods mainly due to the opening of the Loews Arlington Hotel and Convention Center in the first quarter of 2024.

 under the equity method also contributed to the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 period. 
 
 Interest expense increased 14 million and 28 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 perio ds primarily due to placing the Loews Arlington Hotel and Convention Center into service during the first quarter of 2024, after which Loews Hotels Co no longer capitalized interest on that development project and a decline in the value of interest rate caps. 

Corporate 
 
 Corporate operations consist primarily of investment income, interest expense and administrative costs at the Parent Company. Investment income includes earnings on cash and short-term investments held at the Parent Company to meet current and future liquidity needs, as well as results of the trading portfolio held at the Parent Company. Corporate also includes the equity method of accounting for Altium Packaging. 
 
 The following table summarizes the results of operations for Corporate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as presented in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included under Item 1 of this Report: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) Revenues: Net investment income 139 31 202 84 Total 139 31 202 84 Expenses: Operating and other 18 69 58 105 Equity method loss 9 4 15 9 Interest 18 18 56 61 Total 45 91 129 175 Income (loss) before income tax 94 (60) 73 (91) Income tax (expense) benefit (21) 12 (17) 15 Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation 73 (48) 56 (76) 
 
 Net income attributable to Loews Corporation increased 121 million and 132 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 periods primarily due to the reasons discussed below. 
 
 Net investment income for the Parent Company increased 108 million and 118 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 periods, primarily due to the favorable change in the fair value of equity based investments and higher income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities in the trading portfolio. 
 
 Operating and other expenses decreased by 51 million and 47 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 periods. These decreases were primarily due to a settlement expense of 47 million in the third quarter of 2023 to recognize unrealized losses, which were included in AOCI, due to the termination of a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan. For additional information see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included under Item 1 of this Report. 
 
 Interest expense decreased by 5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 period due to the retirement of the Parent Company s 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.6 senior notes in May of 2023.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Parent Company 
 
 Parent Company cash and investments, net of receivables and payables, totaled 3.3 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.6 billion at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we received 975 million in cash dividends from our subsidiaries, including a special cash dividend of 497 million from CNA and distributions of 150 million from Boardwalk Pipelines. Cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the payment of 262 million to fund treasury stock purchases and 42 million of cash dividends to our shareholders . As a holding company we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries and returns on our investment portfolio to fund our obligations. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC under which we may publicly issue an unspecified amount of our debt, equity or hybrid securities from time to time. We are not responsible for the liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries and there are no Parent Company guarantees. 
 
 Depending on market and other conditions, we may purchase shares of our and our subsidiaries outstanding common stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. As of November 1, 2024, we repurchased 4.6 million shares of Loews Corporation common stock in 2024 for a total cost of 353 million. As of November 1, 2024, there were 217,776,738 shares of Loews Corporation common stock outstanding. 
 
 Future uses of our cash may include investing in our subsidiaries, new acquisitions, dividends and/or purchases of our and our subsidiaries outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our earnings, financial condition and business needs. 

Subsidiaries 
 
 CNA s cash provided by operating activities was 1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 1.8 billion for the comparable 2023 period. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by an increase in premiums collected and higher earnings from fixed income securities, partially offset by an increase in net claim payments and higher operating expenses. 
 
 CNA paid cash dividends of 3.32 per share on its common stock, including a special cash dividend of 2.00 per share, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On November 1, 2024 , CNA s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.44 per share payable December 5, 2024 to shareholders of record on November 18, 2024 . CNA s declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of its Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including CNA s earnings, financial condition, business needs and regulatory constraints. CNA believes that its present cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are sufficient to fund its current and expected working capital and debt obligation needs and does not expect this to change in the near term. 
 
 Dividends to CNA from Continental Casualty Company CCC ), a subsidiary of CNA, are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance, are determined based on the greater of the prior year s statutory net income or 10 of statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding 12 months. Additionally, ordinary dividends may only be paid from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. As of September 30, 2024, CCC was in a positive earned surplus position. CCC paid dividends of 635 million and 770 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company. 
 
 In February of 2024 , CNA completed a public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.1 senior notes due February 15, 2034 and in May of 2024, CNA repaid at maturity the outstanding 550 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.0 senior notes. 
 
 CNA has an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it may publicly issue an unspecified amount of debt, equity or hybrid securities from time to time. 
 
 Boardwalk Pipelines cash provided by operating activities increased 68 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 period, primarily due to changes in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization.

Table of contents 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Boardwalk Pipelines capital expenditures were 292 million and 232 million, consisting of growth capital expenditures of 170 million and 137 million and maintenance capital expenditures of 122 million and 95 million. 
 
 In February of 2024 , Boardwalk Pipelines completed a public offering of 600 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.6 senior notes due August 1, 2034 . As of September 30, 2024, Boardwalk Pipelines had the full borrowing capacity of 1.0 billion available under its revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility has a borrowing capacity of 1.0 billion through May 27, 2027, and a borrowing capacity of 912 million from May 28, 2027 to May 26, 2028. Boardwalk Pipelines anticipates that its existing capital resources, including its cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, revolving credit facility and cash flows from operating activities, will be adequate to fund its operations and capital expenditures for 2024 and to retire its 600 million of debt that is maturing in December 2024. As of September 30, 2024, Boardwalk Pipelines also has an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it may publicly issue up to 900 million of debt securities, warrants or rights from time to time. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Boardwalk Pipelines paid distributions of 150 million to the Company. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Loews Hotels Co, through its subsidiaries, had a 108 million mortgage loan that matures within twelve months. Loews Hotels Co currently intends to refinance the loan prior to maturity. Refinancing any indebtedness, including loans of unconsolidated joint venture partnerships, may require Loews Hotels Co to make principal pay downs, establish restricted cash reserves or provide guaranties of the subsidiary s debt. Through the date of this Report, all Loews Hotels Co s subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants. 
 
 Loews Hotels Co refinanced 413 million in mortgage loans in 2024 that were due to mature within twelve months. 
 
 Loews Hotels Co acquired all of the remaining outstanding noncontrolling equity interest of an owned and consolidated hotel for 30 million in the second quarter of 2024. In addition, Loews Hotels Co received aggregate proceeds of 23 million for the sale of an owned hotel in the first quarter of 2024. 

INVESTMENTS 
 
 Investment activities of our non-insurance subsidiaries primarily consist of investments in fixed income securities, including short-term investments. The Parent Company portfolio also includes equity securities, including short sales and derivative instruments. Certain of these types of Parent Company investments generally have greater volatility, less liquidity and greater risk than fixed income investments and are included within Results of Operations Corporate. 
 
 The Parent Company enters into short sales and invests in certain derivative instruments that are used for asset and liability management activities, income enhancements to its portfolio management strategy and to benefit from anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. If such movements do not occur as anticipated, significant losses may occur. Monitoring procedures include senior management review of daily reports of existing positions and valuation fluctuations to seek to ensure that open positions are consistent with the portfolio strategy. 
 
 Credit exposure associated with non-performance by counterparties to derivative instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized change in fair value of the derivative instruments recognized in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. The risk of non-performance is mitigated by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and diversifying derivatives by using multiple counterparties. Collateral is occasionally required from derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount of the exposure and the credit rating of the counterparty. 
 
 Insurance 
 
 CNA maintains a large portfolio of fixed maturity and equity securities, including large amounts of corporate and government issued debt securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities and investments in limited partnerships which pursue a variety of long and short investment strategies across a broad array of asset classes. CNA s investment portfolio supports its obligation to pay future insurance claims and provides investment returns which are an important part of CNA s overall profitability.

Table of contents 

 CNA s pretax investment losses decreased 28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 period driven by lower net losses on disposals of fixed maturity securities and the favorable change in fair value of non-redeemable preferred stock. 
 
 CNA s pretax investment losses decreased 63 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the comparable 2023 period, driven by the favorable change in fair value of non-redeemable preferred stock, lower impairment losses and lower net losses on disposals of fixed maturity securities.

 Duration 
 
 A primary objective in the management of CNA s investment portfolio is to optimize return relative to the corresponding liabilities and respective liquidity needs. CNA s views on the current interest rate environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions as well as domestic and global economic conditions, are some of the factors that enter into an investment decision. CNA also continually monitors exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time adjust such exposures based on its views of a specific issuer or industry sector. 
 
 A further consideration in the management of CNA s investment portfolio is the characteristics of the corresponding liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance liabilities. For portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long-term in nature, CNA segregates investments for asset/liability management purposes. The segregated investments support the long-term care and structured settlement liabilities in Other Insurance Operations. The effective durations of CNA s fixed income securities and short-term investments are presented in the following table. Amounts presented are net of payable and receivable amounts for securities purchased and sold, but not yet settled.

 CNA s investment portfolio is periodically analyzed for changes in duration and related price risk. Certain securities have duration characteristics that are variable based on market interest rates, credit spreads and other factors that may drive variability in the amount and timing of cash flows. Additionally, CNA periodically reviews the sensitivity of the portfolio to the level of foreign exchange rates and other factors that contribute to market price changes. A summary of these risks and specific analysis on changes is included in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included under Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
