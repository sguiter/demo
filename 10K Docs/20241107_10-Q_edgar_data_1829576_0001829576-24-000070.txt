 In March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted final rules under SEC Release No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors . This rule will require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports.

 record an allowance for credit losses, ACL ), on its investment securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 as there was related impairment. The Company regularly reviews debt securities for expected credit loss using both qualitative and quantitative criteria, as necessary, based on the composition of the portfolio at period end. 
 As of September 30, 2024, management does not intend to sell any security in an unrealized loss position and it is not more than likely that it will be required to sell any such security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. The unrealized losses on debt securities are primarily the result of interest rate changes, credit spread fluctuations, general financial market uncertainty and market volatility. These conditions should not prohibit the Company from receiving its contractual principal and interest payments on its debt securities. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date. It should be noted that we may occasionally sell securities to take advantage of market opportunities or as part of a strategic initiative. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined the unrealized losses detailed in the table above are not related to credit; therefore, no ACL has been recognized on the Company s securities. Should the impairment of any of these securities become credit related, the impairment will be recognized by establishing an ACL through provision for credit losses in the period the credit related impairment is identified, while any non-credit loss will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had no credit related net investment impairment losses. 
 Equity Securities 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company purchased million of equity securities with carrying value totaling million at September 30, 2024. These securities are separately reported as equity securities on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The equity securities consist of our investment in a market-rate bond mutual fund that invests in high quality fixed income bonds, mainly government agency securities whose proceeds are designed to positively impact community development throughout the United States. The mutual fund focuses exclusively on providing affordable housing to low- and moderate-income borrowers and renters, including those in Majority Minority Census Tracts. The Company s investment in the mutual fund is eligible for investment credit under the Community Reinvestment Act. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized an unrealized fair value gain of thousand and thousand, respectively, on these equity securities. This unrealized fair value gain is recorded in Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

 Focus reviews of various segments to evaluate emerging risk rather than individual loan risk. Focus reviews are performed annually on a rotational basis. 
 The Company s internally assigned grades are as follows: 
 Pass The Company uses six grades of pass, including its watch rating. Generally, a pass rating indicates that the loan is currently performing and is of high quality. 
 Special Mentio n Assets with potential weaknesses that warrant management s close attention and if left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position at some future date. 
 Substandard Assets that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Such assets are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Doubtful Assets with all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 Loss Assets considered of such little value that its continuance on the books is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. 
 The ability of borrowers to repay commercial loans is dependent upon the success of their business and general economic conditions. Due to the greater potential for loss within our commercial portfolio, we monitor the commercial loan portfolio through an internal risk rating system. Loan risk ratings are assigned based upon the creditworthiness of the borrower and are reviewed on an ongoing basis according to our internal policies. Loans rated special mention or substandard have potential or well-defined weaknesses not generally found in high quality, performing loans, and require attention from management to limit loss.

 There were nonaccrual or past due loans related to loans held-for-sale at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 A loan is considered nonperforming when we transfer the interest methodology from accrual to nonaccrual. Nonaccrual status recognizes that the collection in full of both principal and interest is unlikely. Without applying additional scrutiny at a granular level, management believes delinquency to be a leading indicator with respect to the likelihood of collection in full of both principal and interest. Accordingly, management automatically transfers loans to nonaccrual status if they are 90 or more days delinquent. Management reserves the right to exercise discretion at the individual loan level. For example, we may elect to transfer a loan to nonaccrual regardless of the delinquency status if we believe the collection in full of both principal and interest to be unlikely. We may also elect to retain a loan that is 90 or more days delinquent in accrual status if we believe the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Nonaccrual loans, and loans that have been characterized as Restructured Loans may be individually evaluated for credit losses in the Allowance for Credit Losses model if the loan commitment is million or greater and/or based on management s discretion; unless we elect to maintain the loan in the general pool. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, no material amount of interest income was recognized on nonperforming loans subsequent to their classification as nonperforming loans.

 to days. The Company protects itself from changes in interest rates through the use of best efforts forward delivery commitments, whereby the Company commits to sell a loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the buyer has assumed interest rate risk on rate lock commitments due to changes in interest rates. 
 Nonrecurring Basis 
 Individually Evaluated Loans: Individually evaluated loans with commitments of million or greater and/or based on management s discretion are evaluated for potential specific reserves and adjusted, if a shortfall exists, to fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral securing the loan if repayment is expected solely from the sale or operation of the collateral or present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the loan s contractual interest rate if the loan is not determined to be collateral dependent. All loans with a specific reserve are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 Fair value for individually evaluated loans is determined using several methods. Generally, the fair value of real estate is determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. These routine adjustments are made to adjust the value of a specific property relative to comparable properties for variations in qualities such as location, size, and income production capacity relative to the subject property of the appraisal. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. 
 Subsequent to the initial impairment date, existing individually evaluated loans are reevaluated quarterly for additional impairment and adjustments to fair value less costs to sell are made, where appropriate. For individually evaluated loans, the first stage of our impairment analysis involves inspection of the property in question to affirm the condition has not deteriorated since the previous impairment analysis date. Management also engages in conversations with local real estate professionals and market participants to determine the likely marketing time and value range for the property. The second stage involves an assessment of current trends in the regional market. After thorough consideration of these factors, management will order a new appraisal. 
 For non-collateral dependent loans, the fair value is determined by updating the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate to reflect the payment schedule for the remaining life of the loan. 
 OREO is evaluated at the time of acquisition and is recorded at fair value as determined by an appraisal or evaluation, less costs to sell. After acquisition, most OREO assets are revalued every twelve months, or more frequently when deemed necessary by management based upon changes in market or collateral conditions. For smaller OREO assets with existing carrying values less than million, management may elect to re-value the assets, at minimum, once every twenty-four months based on the size of the exposure. Fair value, when recorded, is generally based upon appraisals by approved, independent state certified

The Level 3 fair value is benchmarked to other securities that have observable market values in Level 2 using comparable financial ratio analysis specific to the industry in which the underlying company operates.

 The Company had million in individually evaluated loans measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. The Company s largest lending relationship is classified at September 30, 2024 as an individually evaluated loan with a net carrying amount totaling million. The Company utilized various cash flow and discounting assumptions in the alternative modeling, instead of fair value, which resulted in a valuation allowance of million at September 30, 2024. When evaluating the net carrying value of this credit relationship at September 30, 2024, the Company utilized discounted cash flow valuation techniques to estimate the timing and magnitude of potential recoveries resulting from various collection processes. 
 OREO, which is measured at the lower of carrying or fair value less costs to sell, had a net carrying amount of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, primarily due to sales offset by transfers to OREO from loans.

 related pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swaps (the Pay-Fixed Swap Agreements for a combined notional amount of million with a combined fair value of million at September 30, 2024. The Pay-Fixed Swap Agreements were designated as fair value hedges in order to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the fixed rate loans included in the amortizing single family mortgages and CRE loans. These fair value hedges convert the hedged loans from a fixed rate to a synthetic floating Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). The first Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement with a notional value of million matures on July 11, 2027 and the Company will pay a fixed coupon rate of while receiving the overnight SOFR. The second Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement with a notional value of million matures on July 11, 2029 (but includes partial amortization beginning July 11, 2027) and the Company will pay a fixed coupon rate of while receiving the overnight SOFR. 
 As long as a hedging instrument is designated and the results of the effectiveness testing support that the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, 100 of the periodic changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are accounted for in net interest income. The fair value of these hedges is recorded in either other assets or in other liabilities depending on the position of the hedge, and the offset is recorded in loans. This is the case whether or not economic mismatches exist in the hedging relationship. As a result, there is no periodic measurement or recognition of ineffectiveness. Rather, the full impact of hedge gains and losses is recognized in the period in which the hedged transactions impact earnings. The hedges were determined to be effective during all periods presented and the Company expects them to remain effective during the remaining terms. 
 Pursuant to agreements with various financial institutions, the Company may receive collateral or may be required to post collateral based upon mark-to-market positions. Beyond unsecured threshold levels, collateral in the form of cash or securities may be made available to counterparties of interest rate swap transactions. Based upon current positions and related future collateral requirements relating to them, management believes any effect on our cash flow or liquidity position to be immaterial. 
 Derivatives contain an element of credit risk, the possibility that the Company will incur a loss because a counterparty, which may be a financial institution or a customer, fails to meet its contractual obligations. All derivative contracts with financial institutions may be executed only with counterparties approved by the Asset and Liability Committee ALCO and all derivatives with customers are approved by a team of members from senior management who have been trained to understand the risk associated with interest rate swaps and have past industry experience. Interest rate swaps are considered derivatives but are not accounted for using hedge accounting. As such, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivatives are recorded in current earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

 Legal Proceedings 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and claims. Legal and administrative proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur, and the timing and outcome of any legal or administrative proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty. Further, estimating an amount or range of possible losses that may result from legal or administrative proceedings and claims is inherently difficult and requires an extensive degree of judgment, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages, may involve awards that are discretionary in amount, present novel legal theories or policies, are in the early stages of the proceedings, or are subject to appeal. In addition, because legal proceedings may be resolved over an extended period of time, potential losses are subject to change due to the outcome of intermediate procedural and substantive rulings, actions by other parties which may be influenced by their settlement posture or their evaluation of the strength or weakness of their case, and other factors. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company is not involved in any other material pending legal proceedings other than proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business. 
 GLAS Federal Court Litigation 
 On February 12, 2024, the Bank was named as a defendant in a lawsuit (the GLAS Federal Court Litigation filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia by GLAS Trust Company LLC GLAS ). The allegations contained in the GLAS Federal Court Litigation relate to a series of financing transactions that occurred in 2018 between Bluestone Resources, Inc. Bluestone Resources ), its subsidiary Bluestone Coal Sales Corporation Bluestone Sales , and together with Bluestone Resources and their respective affiliates, the Bluestone Entities ), and Greensill (UK) Limited, Ltd. Greensill ). The Bluestone Entities are owned and controlled by James C. Justice, II and James C. Justice, III. In the GLAS Federal Court Litigation, GLAS alleged that it serves as trustee for investors that acquired notes via a series of securities transactions that repackaged the Bluestone Entities obligations to repay Greensill and sold them to those investors. In the GLAS Federal Court Litigation, GLAS alleged that certain transfers to the Bank executed during 2018 by the Bluestone Entities or Greensill, which in the aggregate totaled approximately million, each constitute either a fraudulent conveyance, or a voluntary conveyance, under Virginia law. In the GLAS Federal Court Litigation, GLAS sought an award equal to the full amount of such fraudulent conveyances and/or voluntary conveyances plus interest and payment of attorneys fees and costs. 
 On August 28, 2024, the Bank announced that it had agreed to a settlement with GLAS (the GLAS Settlement ). In connection with the GLAS Settlement, the GLAS Federal Court Litigation was dismissed with prejudice, certain entities that are owned or controlled by James C. Justice, II, Cathy L.

 Please also refer to such other factors as discussed throughout Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , and any of our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions using information available at the time the statements are made. We caution you not to unduly rely on forward-looking statements because the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and projections about future events are expressed in or implied by a forward-looking statement may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as to the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update, revise or clarify any forward-looking statement to reflect developments occurring after the statement is made. 
 Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), management uses, and this quarterly report references, interest and dividend income, yield on interest earnings assets, net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent, FTE basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying business, operational performance and performance trends as it facilitates comparisons with the performance of other companies in the financial services industry. The Company believes the presentation of interest and dividend income, yield on interest earnings assets, net interest income and net interest margin on an FTE basis ensures the comparability of interest and dividend income, yield on interest earning assets, net interest income and net interest margin arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. Interest and dividend income (GAAP) per the Consolidated Statements of Income is reconciled to interest and dividend income adjusted on an FTE basis, yield on interest earning assets (GAAP) is reconciled to yield on interest earning assets adjusted on an FTE basis, net interest income (GAAP) is reconciled to net interest income adjusted on an FTE basis and net interest margin (GAAP) is reconciled to net interest margin adjusted on an FTE basis in the "Results of Operations and Financial Condition - Net Interest Income" section of this MD A. 
 Although management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure enhances investors understanding of our business and performance, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered an alternative to GAAP or considered to be more relevant than financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable with similar non-GAAP measures which may be presented by other companies.

 Our critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 have remained unchanged from the disclosures presented under the heading Critical Accounting Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and are incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Overview and Strategy 
 Carter Bankshares, Inc. (the Company is a bank holding company headquartered in Martinsville, Virginia with assets of 4.6 billion at September 30, 2024. The Company is the parent company of its wholly owned subsidiary, Carter Bank Trust (the Bank ). The Bank is a FDIC insured, Virginia state-chartered bank, which operates 65 branches in Virginia and North Carolina. The Company provides a full range of financial services with retail, and commercial banking products and insurance. Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol CARE . 
 The Company earns revenue primarily from interest on loans and securities and fees charged for financial services provided to our customers. The Company incurs expenses for the cost of deposits, provision for credit losses and other operating costs such as salaries and employee benefits, data processing, occupancy and income tax provision. 
 Part of the Company s current three-year strategic plan is to focus on refining and enhancing its brand image and position in the markets it serves. With this new brand strategy, the Company has embarked on a multi-year implementation plan to c reate a brand tailored to the needs of our critical growth audiences, with a focus on innovating brand experiences to exceed expectations and to build a brand that stands apart. This means a commitment to aligning processes, operations and systems around the Company s brand while introducing new products and services, so that in time the Company can increase its brand awareness in the communities it serves. To strengthen and further shape the brand and culture of the Company, a new set of guiding principles were introduced to associates in June 2023. The guiding principles include a new purpose statement: To create opportunities for more people and businesses to prosper; supported by our new set of core values: Build Relationships, Earn Trust and Take Ownership. We believe these new guiding principles will help create alignment to support future growth by empowering our associates and igniting a passion for the Company. 
 The Company s goal is to shift from restructuring the balance sheet to pursuing a prudent growth strategy when appropriate. We believe this strategy will be primarily targeted at organic growth, but will also consider opportunistic acquisitions that fit this strategic vision. We believe that the Bank s strong capital and liquidity positions support this strategy. In addition to loan and deposit growth, the Company will seek to increase fee income while closely monitoring operating expenses. 
 The Company is focused on executing this strategy to successfully support the new brand and grow our business in our current markets as well as any new markets we may enter. As part of executing this strategy, the Company continues to dedicate significant resources to the ultimate resolution of the Company s nonaccrual loans, the significant majority of which are related to a single large lending relationship that the Company placed on nonaccrual status in the second quarter of 2023, in a manner that best protects the Company, the Bank and shareholders. The Company is closely monitoring all developments that may impact collateral values or potential recoveries on its nonperforming loans, including claims that may be asserted by other purported creditors. 
 During the third quarter of 2024 , the Company obtained a voluntary stipulation of dismissal of the lawsuit filed against the Bank in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia (Danville Division) on February 10, 2024 (the GLAS Trust Lawsuit by GLAS Trust Company, LLC, in its capacity as Note Trustee GLAS Trust with prejudice. Accordingly, GLAS Trust may not bring any future legal action in any court based on the facts alleged in the GLAS Trust Lawsuit. Moreover, in connection with the dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit, GLAS Trust and certain affiliates and parties on whose behalf it is acting have executed a release that waives any and all causes of action of any kind that they might claim to have against the Bank. 
 The dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit ended all pending litigation brought against the Bank by GLAS Trust in connection with the Bank s lending relationship with James C. Justice, II and the entities in which he has an interest. Also in connection with the dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit, certain Justice Entities executed documents reaffirming the legality, validity and binding nature of all loan documents they have executed in favor of the Bank.

 The Company tendered a payment (the Settlement Payment in consideration of the voluntary dismissal of the GLAS Trust Lawsuit. Because certain of the Justice Entities had previously agreed to indemnify the Bank against the claims asserted in the GLAS Federal Court Litigation, certain of the Justice Entities executed a promissory note in favor of the Bank further evidencing this indemnification obligation as related to the Settlement Payment. This promissory note was recognized as a principal charge-off during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the nonperforming status of the Bank s loans with the Justice Entities, and because the settled claims related to allegedly preferential payments made on those nonperforming loans. 
 During the second quarter of 2024 the federal court lawsuit filed against the Company and the Bank by West Virginia Governor James C. Justice II, his wife Cathy L. Justice, his son James C. Justice, III, and related entities that he and/or they own was dismissed with prejudice. In connection with the dismissal of this litigation, the Justice Entities agreed upon a pathway of curtailment and payoff of the outstanding loans with the Bank. The Justice Entities have reduced the aggregate nonperforming loan balance associated with the Justice Entities has been reduced from 301.9 million as of March 31, 2024 to 280.9 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company s financial results continue to be significantly impacted by the Bank s largest nonperforming lending relationship that was placed on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023, which has an aggregate principal balance of 280.9 million as of September 30, 2024. As a result, interest income was negatively impacted by 8.8 million and 9.3 million during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 27.2 million and 20.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the same period in 2023, respectively. Interest income has been negatively impacted by 57.2 million in the aggregate since placement of these loans on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023.

 Net Interest Income 
 Our principal source of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the average balance of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads. The level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is managed by our Asset and Liability Committee ALCO ), in order to mitigate interest rate and liquidity risks of the balance sheet. A variety of ALCO strategies were implemented, within prescribed ALCO risk parameters, to produce what the Company believes is an acceptable level of net interest income. 
 Net interest income and the net interest margin are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE basis (non-GAAP) adjusts net interest income and net interest margin for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and securities using the applicable federal statutory tax rate for each period (which was 21 for the periods presented). The Company believes this FTE basis presentation provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable sources of interest income. Refer to the Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures above for additional discussion regarding the non-GAAP measures used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The following table reconciles interest and dividend income (GAAP), yield on interest-earning assets (GAAP), net interest margin (GAAP) and net interest income per the Consolidated Statements of Income to interest and dividend income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), yield on interest-earning assets on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) and net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), respectively, for the periods presented:

 Net interest income increased to 28.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 27.4 million for the same period in 2023. Net interest income, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), increased 1.3 million, or 4.9 , to 29.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The net interest margin increased 6 basis points to 2.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.52 for the same period in 2023. Net interest margin, on an FTE basis, increased 5 basis points to 2.59 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.54 for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily a result of higher average interest-earning assets of 127.1 million with the yield on average interest-earning assets increasing 57 basis points. The most significant increase in interest-earning assets was a 65 basis point increase in the yield on average loans from 4.78 in the third quarter of 2023 to 5.43 in the third quarter of 2024, as well as a higher average loan balance. 
 Net interest income decreased to 85.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 94.9 million for the same period in 2023. Net interest income, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), decreased 9.8 million, or 10.2 , to 85.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 95.7 million for the same period in 2023. The net interest margin decreased 41 basis points to 2.57 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.98 for the same period in 2023. Net interest margin, on an FTE basis, decreased 41 basis points to 2.59 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.00 for the same period in 2023. The decline in net interest income and net interest margin were significantly driven by the Bank s largest nonperforming lending relationship that was placed on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023, which negatively impacted interest income by 27.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and by 20.7 million for the same period in 2023. Funding costs increased 104 basis points, offset by an increase of 43 basis points on the yield on earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. During the

 nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1.2 billion of CDs matured and repriced from an average rate of 4.33 to an average rate of 4.40 . 
 Interest income increased to 56.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 48.9 million compared to the same period in 2023. Interest income, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), increased 7.7 million, or 15.6 , to 56.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 49.1 million for the same period in 2023, primarily from growth in earning assets and higher earning asset yields. Average interest-earning assets increased primarily due to average loan growth of 200.4 million in loans and an increase of 31.2 million in interest-bearing deposits with banks during the third quarter of 2024, and was partially offset by a decrease of 93.4 million in average investment securities and a decrease of 11.1 million in FHLB stock. The Bank s largest nonperforming lending relationship negatively impacted interest income by 8.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 and was negatively impacted by 9.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest income increased to 165.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 144.6 million compared to the same period in 2023. Interest income, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), increased 20.5 million, or 14.1 , to 165.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 145.3 million for the same period in 2023, resulting from average loan growth of 275.5 million in taxable loans. 
 The change in average investment securities is the result of active balance sheet management to deploy the proceeds from securities maturities and principal curtailments into higher yielding loans, rather than reinvesting those proceeds back into the securities portfolio. The portfolio has been diversified as to bond types, maturities, and interest rate structures. As of September 30, 2024, the securities portfolio was comprised of 43.7 variable rate securities with approximately 96.9 that will reprice at least once over the next 12 months. We believe having a significant percentage of variable rate securities is an important strategy during times of rising interest rates because fixed-rate bond prices generally fall when interest rates increase, which can result in unrealized losses. However, variable rate securities do not carry as much interest rate risk so there is much less price volatility. This variable rate strategy has limited the impact of rising rates on the Company s unrealized losses on debt securities. With the Federal Reserve on a likely path of reducing short-term interest rates, the Bank may alter this interest rate mix strategy going forward. 
 Interest expense of 27.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.3 million, or 29.3 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of 430.9 million. The increase in average-bearing deposits reflected solid growth in average CDs of 349.2 million, an increase of 128.7 million in interest-bearing demand accounts and an increase of 71.0 million in average money market accounts, offset by a decrease of 118.0 million in savings accounts as customer preferences shifted from lower cost non-maturing deposits to higher-yielding interest-bearing demand, money market and CD products. Interest expense of 79.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 30.3 million, or 60.9 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an average increase in CDs of 345.8 million. 
 Our balance sheet is currently exhibiting characteristics of a slightly liability sensitive position due to the short-term nature of our deposit portfolio and FHLB borrowings. Specifically, 93.0 of our CD portfolio and 50.0 of our outstanding FHLB borrowings will mature and reprice over the next twelve months. This strategy gives us flexibility to manage the structure and pricing of our deposit and borrowing portfolios to reduce future funding costs should the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC continue cutting short-term rates in the future.

 (Recovery) Provision for Credit Losses 
 (Recovery) provision for credit losses is determined based on management s estimates of the appropriate level of ACL needed to absorb expected life-of-loan losses in the loan and lease portfolio, after giving consideration to charge-offs and recoveries for the period. The following table presents information regarding the (recovery) provision for credit losses and net charge-offs: 
 (Dollars in Thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change (Recovery) Provision for Credit Losses (432) 1,105 (1,537) 75 2,605 (2,530) Provision (Recovery) for Unfunded Commitments 191 (130) 321 (88) 314 (402) Total (Recovery) Provision for Credit Losses on Loans (241) 975 (1,216) (13) 2,919 (2,932) Provision for Securities Total (Recovery) Provision for Credit Losses (241) 975 (1,216) (13) 2,919 (2,932) Net Loan Charge-offs 15,345 775 14,570 16,218 1,983 14,235 Net Loan Charge-offs (annualized) / Average Portfolio Loans 1.71 0.09 0.61 0.08 
 The (recovery) provision for credit losses decreased 1.5 million and 2.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the (recovery) provision for credit losses as compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily driven by updated analysis of the individually evaluated loans within the Other loan segment and 1.7 million of other segment

 reserves released during the third quarter of 2024 related to 13.2 million of curtailment payments made during the third quarter by the Bank s largest nonperforming lending relationship, offset by loan growth in the third quarter of 2024. 
 The provision (recovery) for unfunded commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a provision of 0.2 million and a recovery (0.1) million, respectively, compared to a recovery of (0.1) million and a provision of 0.3 million in the same periods in 2023, respectively. The decrease and the increase in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively were due to changes in commitments in construction loans during the periods. 
 Net charge-offs were 15.3 million and 16.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.8 million and 2.0 million for the same periods in 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, net charge-offs were significantly impacted by a 15.0 million principal charge-off related to the Other segment of the loan portfolio. As a percentage of average portfolio loans, on an annualized basis, net charge-offs were 1.71 and 0.61 for the three and nine months ended 2024 and 0.09 and 0.08 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The 15.0 million principal charge-off related to the Other segment of the loan portfolio. Certain Justice Entities executed a promissory note related to the Settlement Payment (as defined in Note 10). This promissory note was recognized as a principal charge-off due to the nonperforming status of the Bank s loans with the Justice Entities and because the settled claims related to allegedly preferential payments made on those nonperforming loans. See the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this MD A for additional details regarding our charge-offs and for additional information related to our ACL.

 Total noninterest income increased 0.2 million, or 2.9 , to 5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased 1.0 million, or 6.4 , to 16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher insurance commissions of 0.2 million, offset by a decrease of 0.1 million in other noninterest income related to lower fair value adjustment of our interest rate swap contracts with commercial customers. 
 The most significant increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher insurance commissions of 1.1 million. Also impacting the increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a 0.2 million increase in service charges, commissions and fees, offset by a decrease of 0.2 million in other noninterest income similar to the decrease mentioned above and a decline of 0.1 million in commercial loan swap fee income as activity has declined due to the interest rate environment.

 Total noninterest expense increased 0.2 million to 27.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The most significant variance for the comparable period related to a 0.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, an increase of 0.4 million in occupancy expenses, an increase of 0.3 million in data processing expenses and a 0.2 million increase in FDIC insurance expense, offset by a decrease of 1.1 million in other noninterest expense and a decrease of 0.3 million in professional and legal fees. 
 
 The increases in salaries and employee benefits resulted from higher salary expenses due to fewer open positions in retail, job grade assessment increases and normal merit increases. The increase in occupancy expenses, net of 0.4 million was due to new software license and depreciation expense in the third quarter of 2024 and the increase in data processing expenses of 0.3 million relates primarily to general inflationary cost increases for existing and new service agreements. The increase in advertising expenses relates to costs incurred for the Company s new brand roll-out. The higher FDIC insurance expense was due to the deterioration in asset quality as a direct result of the large nonperforming lending relationship that was placed into nonaccrual status in the second quarter of 2023, which is a component used to determine the assessment. The decrease in other noninterest expense related to a gain of 0.5 million on a closed office that was sold in the third quarter of 2024, write-downs of 0.6 million on three legacy other real estate owned OREO properties and write-downs of 0.3 million on two additional closed offices in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Total noninterest expense increased 4.7 million or 6.2 to 81.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The most significant variances were similar to those mentioned for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. However, the year-to-date variance was also impacted by an increase of 0.4 million in debit card expense related to discounts received in March of 2023, as well as, a decrease of 0.3 million in telephone expenses due to the lower ongoing cost of a new phone system that was replaced in 2023. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes increased 0.6 million and decreased 1.4 million to 1.4 million and 3.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively when compared to the same periods in 2023. Pre-tax income increased 2.6 million and decreased 10.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively when compared to the same periods in 2023. The effective tax rate was 19.9 and 19.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 17.7 and 17.4 for the same periods in 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily related to changes in pre-tax income, partially offset by higher levels of tax credits in 2023. The Company ordinarily generates an annual effective tax rate that is less than the statutory rate of 21 due to benefits resulting from tax-exempt interest income, tax credit projects and bank owned life insurance BOLI ).

 Financial Condition 
 September 30, 2024 
 Total assets increased 100.9 million, to 4.6 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Cash and due from banks increased 50.5 million to 105.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 54.5 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher excess cash on hand in the third quarter of 2024. Total portfolio loans increased 90.0 million, or 3.4 on an annualized basis, to 3.6 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 primarily due to loan growth in the CRE loan segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Loan growth was muted by 80.0 million in loan payoffs of two large commercial real estate loans in the first quarter of 2024. The variances in loan segments for portfolio loans related to increases of 187.4 million in CRE loans, offset by decreases in all the other loan segments, such as a 36.8 million decrease in construction loans, a 30.0 million decrease in C I loans, a 21.1 million decrease in the other loan segment due to curtailment payments made by the Bank s largest nonperforming lending relationship, a 5.0 million decrease in residential mortgages and a 4.5 million decrease in other consumer loans. 
 The securities portfolio decreased 36.4 million and is currently 16.1 of total assets at September 30, 2024 compared to 17.3 of total assets at December 31, 2023. The decrease is due to ongoing maturities, principal curtailments, purchases and sales of available for sale securities and changes in market values driven by fluctuations in intermediate treasury yields. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 there was one new security purchase of 8.6 million and one sale of two bonds with a book value of 10.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, the securities portfolio was comprised of 43.7 variable rate securities with approximately 96.9 that will reprice at least once over the next 12 months. At September 30, 2024, total gross unrealized gains in the available-for-sale portfolio were 0.1 million, offset by 68.4 million of gross unrealized losses. Refer to the Securities section below for further discussion of unrealized losses in the available-for-sale securities portfolio. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company purchased 5.0 million of equity securities with carrying value totaling 5.2 million at September 30, 2024. The equity securities consist of our investment in a market-rate bond mutual fund that invests in high quality fixed income bonds, mainly government agency securities whose proceeds are designed to positively impact community development throughout the United States. The mutual fund focuses exclusively on providing affordable housing to low- and moderate-income borrowers and renters, including those in Majority Minority Census Tracts. The Company s investment in the mutual fund is eligible for investment credit under the Community Reinvestment Act. 
 FHLB stock, at cost decreased 14.2 million to 7.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease is due to a lower level of FHLB borrowings due to deposit growth that funded paydowns of FHLB borrowings . Closed retail bank offices had a book value of 0.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 2.3 million at December 31, 2023 included in OREO on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The ACL was 2.25 of total portfolio loans at September 30, 2024 compared to 2.77 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily related to an updated analysis of the individually evaluated loans, a 15.0 million charge-off related to the Other segment of the loan portfolio and 3.1 million of Other segment specific reserves released in connection with 21.0 million of curtailment payments made by the Bank s largest nonperforming lending relationship. General reserves as a percentage of total portfolio loans were 1.21 at September 30, 2024 and 1.22 at December 31, 2023. Management believes the ACL is adequate to absorb expected losses inherent in the loan portfolio. See the sections of this MD A titled Provision for Credit Losses, Credit Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses for information about the factors that impacted the ACL and the provision for credit losses. 
 Total deposits increased 363.2 million, or 13.0 on an annualized basis, to 4.1 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits was primarily due to a 343.4 million increase in CDs and an increase of 167.5 million in interest-bearing demand accounts, offset by a decrease of 82.0 million in savings accounts, a decrease of 56.3 million in noninterest-bearing demand accounts and a decrease of 9.4 million in money market accounts. The Company had 216.1 million brokered CDs at September 30, 2024, compared to 70.0 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits comprised 15.4 of total deposits compared to 18.4 at December 31, 2023 and 18.7 at September 30, 2023. CDs comprised 47.2 , 42.6 and 42.5 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, based on assumptions that the Bank uses to prepare its regulatory call report, approximately 82.7 of our total deposits of 4.1 billion were insured under standard FDIC insurance coverage limits, and approximately 17.3 of our total deposits were uninsured deposits over the standard FDIC

 insurance coverage limit. The Company s deposit base is diversified and granular and is comprised of approximately 78.5 of retail deposits. 
 
 FHLB borrowings decreased 303.4 million to 90.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 393.4 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decline in overnight borrowings, offset by 146.1 million of new brokered CDs during the third quarter of 2024, as well as deposit growth. The Company had no outstanding federal funds purchased at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Total capital of 386.8 million at September 30, 2024, reflects an increase of 35.6 million compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total capital from December 31, 2023 is primarily due to net income of 16.2 million, an increase of 18.1 million in other comprehensive income (loss) due to changes in fair value of investment securities, as well as an increase of 1.3 million related to restricted stock activity all during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company remains well capitalized. The Tier 1 capital ratio decreased to 10.83 at September 30, 2024 compared to 11.08 at December 31, 2023. The leverage ratio was 9.53 at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.48 at December 31, 2023 and the total risk-based capital ratio was 12.09 at September 30, 2024 compared to 12.34 at December 31, 2023. 
 The Bank also remained well capitalized as of September 30, 2024. The Bank s Tier 1 Capital ratio was 10.75 at September 30, 2024 compared to 10.99 at December 31, 2023. The Bank s leverage ratio was 9.45 at September 30, 2024 compared to 9.41 at December 31, 2023. The Bank s Total Risk-Based Capital ratio was 12.01 at September 30, 2024 compared to 12.25 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Securities 
 The following table presents the composition of available-for-sale securities: 
 (Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change U.S. Government Agency Securities 27,475 43,827 (16,352) Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities 98,809 99,150 (341) Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities 23,041 31,163 (8,122) Other Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities 22,267 21,856 411 Asset Backed Securities 121,146 140,006 (18,860) Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 156,418 161,533 (5,115) States and Political Subdivisions 231,172 222,108 9,064 Corporate Notes 62,307 59,360 2,947 Total Debt Securities 742,635 779,003 (36,368) 
 The Company invests in various securities in order to maintain a source of liquidity, to satisfy various pledging requirements, to increase net interest income and as a tool of the ALCO to diversify and reposition the balance sheet for interest rate risk purposes. Securities are subject to market risks that could negatively affect the level of liquidity available to us. Security purchases are subject to our investment policy that is approved annually by our Board and administered through ALCO and our treasury function. 
 The securities portfolio decreased 36.4 million to 742.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 779.0 million at December 31, 2023. Securities comprise 16.1 of total assets at September 30, 2024 compared to 17.3 at December 31, 2023. The decrease is due to ongoing maturities, principal curtailments, purchases and sales of available for sale securities and changes in market values driven by fluctuations in intermediate treasury yields. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was one new security purchase of 8.6 million and one sale of two bonds with a book value of 10.6 million as liquidity generated by the securities portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily deployed into higher yielding loans. As of September 30, 2024, the securities portfolio was comprised of 43.7 variable rate securities with approximately 96.9 that will reprice at least once over the next 12 months. 
 At September 30, 2024 total gross unrealized gains in the available-for-sale portfolio were 0.1 million, offset by 68.4 million of gross unrealized losses. At December 31, 2023, total gross unrealized gains in the available-for-sale portfolio were 0.7 million offset by 92.3 million of gross unrealized losses.

 The unrealized losses on debt securities are believed to be temporary primarily because these unrealized losses are due to reductions in market value caused by upward movement in interest rates since the securities purchase (as applicable), and not related to the credit quality of these securities. Our portfolio consists of 46.9 of securities issued by United States government sponsored entities and carry an implicit government guarantee. States and political subdivisions comprise 31.1 of the portfolio and are largely general obligations or essential purpose revenue bonds, which have performed very well historically over all business cycles, and are rated AA and AAA. We have the ability to hold these securities to maturity and expect full recovery of the amortized cost. We may occasionally sell securities to take advantage of market opportunities or as part of a strategic initiative. 
 The Company s investment securities with intermediate and long-term maturities were the largest driver of these gross unrealized losses, as the market values of these securities are significantly impacted by the Treasury yield curve for similar durations (i.e., 5- and 10-year Treasury securities). This portion of the Treasury yield curve has moved lower over the past three months, driving unrealized losses on outstanding securities lower. Changes in short-term interest rates can affect the yield on floating rate securities. Yields on floating rate securities will fall as the Federal Reserve Board FRB lower short-term rates. Changes in intermediate and long-term interest rates, which are market driven, affect the market value of fixed rate securities with similar maturities. The Company expects that market values on the Bank s intermediate and long-term maturity holdings will continue to fluctuate in large part driven by treasury yield changes. 
 At September 30, 2024 the 5-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields were 3.58 and 3.81 , respectively. At December 31, 2023, those same bond yields were 3.84 and 3.88 , respectively. Therefore, this decrease of 26 bps and 7 bps, respectively in the intermediate part of the yield curve largely caused an increase in bond prices for fixed rate bonds in that maturity range. Note, the effects were generally greater for longer maturity bonds, such as municipal bonds. On the other hand, floating rate bonds largely held consistent values, as those interest rates generally adjust in line with FRB interest rate moves. 
 Should the impairment of any of these securities become credit related, the impairment will be recognized by establishing an ACL through provision for credit losses in the period the credit related impairment is identified, while any non-credit loss will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no credit related impairment. 
 The Basel rules permit most banking organizations to retain, through a one-time election, existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive loss, which currently does not affect regulatory capital. The Company elected to retain this treatment which reduces the volatility of regulatory capital levels. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company purchased 5.0 million of equity securities with carrying value totaling 5.2 million at September 30, 2024. The equity securities consist of our investment in a market-rate bond mutual fund that invests in high quality fixed income bonds, mainly government agency securities whose proceeds are designed to positively impact community development throughout the United States. The mutual fund focuses exclusively on providing affordable housing to low- and moderate-income borrowers and renters, including those in Majority Minority Census Tracts. The Company s investment in the mutual fund is eligible for investment credit under the Community Reinvestment Act.

 Loan Composition 
 The following table summarizes our loan portfolio as of the dates presented:

 Our loan portfolio represents our most significant source of interest income. The risk that borrowers are unable to pay such obligations is inherent in the loan portfolio. Other conditions such as downturns in the borrower's industry or the overall economic climate can significantly impact the borrower s ability to pay. For a discussion of the risk factors relevant to our business and operations, please refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 Total portfolio loans increased 90.0 million, or 3.4 , on an annualized basis, and was 3.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and 3.5 billion at December 31, 2023 with production primarily in our CRE portfolio. The CRE portfolio is monitored for potential concentrations of credit risk by market, property type and tenant concentrations. Given the current interest rate environment, our mortgage portfolio paydowns outpaced growth in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the loan portfolio was comprised of 26.4 floating rates which reprice monthly, 39.1 , variable rates that reprice at least once during the life of the loan and the remaining 34.5 are fixed rate loans. The Company continues to carefully monitor the loan portfolio during 2024, including in light of market conditions that impact our borrowers and the interest rate environment. 
 Total CRE represented 51.7 of total portfolio loans at September 30, 2024 compared to 47.7 at December 31, 2023. The collateral for the Company s CRE loans is concentrated predominantly in North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, West Virginia and Georgia within the retail/restaurant, warehouse, hospitality, multifamily, and office metrics.

 CRE loans represent a portfolio concentration risk. The majority of our CRE loans are made in the above noted geographies and granted to experienced developers and sponsors with loan guaranty structures that provide recourse to individuals with access to financial resources. We believe our knowledge of CRE and our operating knowledge at the local and regional level of these markets allows us to effectively manage concentration risk. Our operating knowledge at the local and regional level is derived from our front-line connection to the customer and our understanding of their business model. We also have access to research tools that inform us about market statistics such as occupancy, lease growth rates and new construction starts. This data is reviewed frequently by our credit officers and disseminated to our lenders. The Bank s underwriting process includes multiple shock scenarios primarily focused on cash flow and leverage in order to determine a supportable loan amount. 
 We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio by segment, geography, collateral and industry while actively managing concentrations. When concentrations exist in certain segments, we seek to mitigate this risk by reviewing the relevant economic indicators and internal risk rating trends of the loans in these segments. The Company established transaction, relationship and specific loan segment limits in its loan policy. Total commercial real estate balances should not exceed the combination of 300 of total risk-based capital and growth in excess of 50 over the previous thirty-six months and construction loan balances should not exceed 100 of total risk-based capital. Investment real estate property types and purchased loan programs have individual dollar limits that should not be exceeded in the portfolio and are based on 
 55

 management s risk tolerance relative to capital. In addition, there are specific targets for various categories of real estate loans with respect to debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios, loan terms, and amortization periods. We also have policy limits on loan-to-cost for construction projects. Although leverage is important, the Company also focuses on cash flow generation and employs stress testing to calculate a supportable loan amount. 
 Aggregate commitments to our top 10 credit relationships was 717.2 million at September 30, 2024. The Other segment represents 39.2 of the top 10 credit relationships including the Bank s largest nonperforming lending relationship, the entire balance which was transferred to nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023, as described in more detail below under Credit Quality in this MD A. 
 The following table summarizes our top 10 relationships and a description of industries represented for the periods presented:

 Unfunded commitments on lines of credit were 605.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 568.7 million at December 31, 2023. The majority of unused commitments are for construction projects that will be drawn as the construction completes. Total utilization was 52.8 at September 30, 2024 and 53.8 at December 31, 2023. Unfunded commitments on commercial operating lines of credit was 52.6 at September 30, 2024 and 53.7 at December 31, 2023. 
 Unsecured loans pose higher risk for the Company due to the lack of a well-defined secondary source of repayment. Commercial unsecured loans are reserved for the best quality customers with well-established businesses that operate with low financial and operating leverage. The repayment capacity of the borrower should exceed the policy and guidelines for secured loans. The Company significantly increased the standards for consumer unsecured lending by adjusting upward the required qualifying Fair Isaac Corporation FICO scores and restricting loan amounts at lower FICO scores. 
 Deferred costs and fees included in the portfolio balances above were 7.7 million and 7.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Discounts on purchased 1-4 family loans included in the portfolio balances above were 113.4 thousand and 133.4 thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Refer to Note 4, Loans and Loans Held-for-Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to our loans. 
 
 Credit Quality 
 On a monthly basis, a Criticized Asset Committee meets to review certain watch, special mention and substandard risk rated loans within prescribed policy thresholds. These loans typically represent the highest risk of loss to the Company. Action plans are established and these loans are monitored through regular contact with the borrower and loan officer, review of current financial information and other documentation, review of all loan or potential loan restructures or modifications and the regular re-evaluation of assets held as collateral.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued) 

 On a quarterly basis, the Credit Risk Committee of the Board meets to review our loan portfolio metrics, approve segment limits, approve the adequacy of ACL, and review the findings from Loan Review identified in the previous quarter. Annually, this same committee approves credit related policy changes and policy enhancements as they become available. 
 Additional credit risk management practices include continuous reviews of trends in our lending footprint and our lending policies and procedures to support sound underwriting practices, concentrations, delinquencies and annual portfolio stress testing. Our Loan Review department serves as a mechanism to independently monitor credit quality and assess the effectiveness of credit risk management practices to provide oversight of all lending activities. The loan review function has the primary responsibility for assessing commercial credit administration and credit decision functions of consumer and mortgage underwriting, as well as determining the appropriateness of risk ratings for those loans reviewed and providing input to the loan risk rating process. Our policy is to place loans in all categories in nonaccrual status when collection of interest or principal is doubtful, or generally when interest or principal payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms. Consumer unsecured loans and secured loans are evaluated for charge-off after the loan becomes 90 days past due. Loans past due 90 days are automatically transferred to nonaccrual status. Management reserves the right to exercise discretion at the individual loan level. For example, we may elect to transfer a loan to nonaccrual regardless of the delinquency status if we believe the collection in full of both principal and interest to be unlikely. We may also elect to retain a loan that is 90 or more days delinquent in accrual status if we believe the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Unsecured loans are fully charged-off and secured loans are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral less the cost to sell. 
 The ability of borrowers to repay commercial loans is dependent upon the success of their business and general economic conditions. Due to the greater potential for loss within our commercial portfolio, we monitor the commercial loan portfolio through an internal risk rating system. Loan risk ratings are assigned based upon the creditworthiness of the borrower and are reviewed on an ongoing basis according to our internal policies. Loans rated special mention or substandard have potential or well-defined weaknesses not generally found in high quality, performing loans, and require attention from management to limit loss. 
 Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans and OREO. The following table summarizes nonperforming assets for the dates presented: 
 (Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Nonaccrual Loans Commercial Real Estate 978 1,324 (346) Commercial and Industrial 1,094 52 1,042 Residential Mortgages 4,482 3,283 1,199 Other Consumer 20 59 (39) Construction 231 2,904 (2,673) Other 280,905 301,913 (21,008) Total Nonperforming Loans 287,710 309,535 (21,825) Other Real Estate Owned 1,512 2,463 (951) Total Nonperforming Assets 289,222 311,998 (22,776) 
 Nonperforming assets decreased 22.8 million to 289.2 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease of 21.8 million in nonperforming loans was primarily related to 21.0 million of curtailment payments made by the Bank s largest nonperforming relationship. 
 During the second quarter of 2023, the Company placed 301.9 million of commercial loans that reside in the Other segment of the Company s loan portfolio, relating to the Bank s largest lending relationship, on nonaccrual status due to loan maturities and failure to pay in full. These loans remained on nonaccrual status at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These nonperforming loans are 97.6 of the Company's total nonperforming loans and 97.1 of the Company's total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the federal court lawsuit filed against the Company and the Bank by West Virginia Governor James C. Justice II, his wife Cathy L. Justice, his son James C. Justice, III, and related entities that he and/or they own (collectively, the Justice Entities was dismissed and we have agreed upon a pathway of curtailment and payoff of the outstanding loans with the Bank. During the second and third quarters of 2024, 21.0 million of curtailment payments made by the Bank s largest nonperforming lending relationship have decreased the aggregate nonperforming loan balance outstanding to

 the Bank to 280.9 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company believes it is well secured based on the net carrying value of the credit relationship and it has appropriately reserved for expected credit losses with respect to all such loans based on information currently available. However, the Company cannot give any assurance as to the timing or amount of future payments or collections on such loans or that the Company will ultimately collect all amounts contractually due. The Company is closely monitoring all developments that may impact collateral values or potential recoveries on its nonperforming loans, including claims that may be asserted by other purported creditors. 
 Based on analyses of the credit relationship and various discounted cash flow valuation techniques utilized in the alternative modeling, which resulted in a specific reserves with respect to these loans of 36.9 million at September 30, 2024, representing 13.1 , of these loans aggregate principal amount as compared to 54.3 million or 18.0 of these loans aggregate principal amount at December 31, 2023. This decline was driven by updated analysis of the credit relationship during the third quarter of 2024 using the discounted cash flow model with updated assumptions and inputs regarding the credit relationship, legal risk and related risks. 
 As the borrowers on these loans operate in the hospitality, agriculture, and energy sectors, this credit relationship is secured by, among other collateral, commercial real estate properties in these sectors including but not limited to top-tier hospitality properties. When evaluating the net carrying value of this credit relationship at September 30, 2024, the Company utilized discounted cash flow valuation techniques to estimate the timing and magnitude of potential recoveries resulting from various collection processes.

 Closed retail bank offices had a book value of 0.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 2.3 million at December 31, 2023, and are recorded in OREO on the Company s balance sheet. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank sold three retail banking offices and moved 1.2 million of loans at fair value to OREO. These properties are currently being marketed for sale. 
 Past Company legacy underwriting standards relied heavily on loan to value and did not necessarily consider the income characteristics of the borrower or the repayment capacity of collateral with respect to speculative land financing. An overreliance on value as a primary repayment source can become compromised during real estate cycles. As a result, management has worked through these legacy credits and has installed a number of underwriting guardrails that consider the global cash flows and repayment capability of borrowers and/or guarantors, the proportion of speculation, transaction limits and introduced sensitivity analysis in order to determine supportable loan amounts. While these guardrails do not insulate the Company from credit cycles, management believes it should reduce the experience of defaults. 
 Closed-end installment loans, amortizing loans secured by real estate and any other loans with payments scheduled monthly are reported past due when the borrower is in arrears two or more monthly payments. Other multi-payment obligations with payments scheduled other than monthly are reported past due when one scheduled payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. We monitor delinquency on a monthly basis, including loans that are at risk for becoming delinquent and early stage delinquencies in order to identify emerging patterns and potential problem loans. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The following is the allocation of the ACL reserves by segment for the periods presented: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars in Thousands) Amount of Loans in each Category to Total Portfolio Loans Amount of Loans in each Category to Total Portfolio Loans Commercial Real Estate 20,067 51.7 19,873 47.7 Commercial Industrial 2,936 6.7 3,286 7.7 Residential Mortgages 10,520 21.8 10,879 22.5 Other Consumer 724 0.8 868 1.0 Construction 9,742 11.1 7,792 12.4 Other 36,920 7.9 54,354 8.7 Balance End of Period 80,909 100.0 97,052 100.0 
 The ACL was 80.9 million, or 2.25 , of total portfolio loans at September 30, 2024 compared to 97.1 million, or 2.77 , of total portfolio loans at December 31, 2023.

 The following table summarizes the credit quality ratios and their components as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 (Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Allowance for Credit Losses to Total Portfolio Loans Allowance for Credit Losses 80,909 97,052 Total Portfolio Loans 3,595,861 3,505,910 Allowance for Credit Losses to Total Portfolio Loans 2.25 2.77 Nonperforming Loans to Total Portfolio Loans Nonperforming Loans 287,710 309,535 Total Portfolio Loans 3,595,861 3,505,910 Nonperforming Loans to Total Portfolio Loans 8.00 8.83 Allowance for Credit Losses to Nonperforming Loans Allowance for Credit Losses 80,909 97,052 Nonperforming Loans 287,710 309,535 Allowance for Credit Losses to Nonperforming Loans 28.12 31.35 Net Charge-offs to Average Portfolio Loans Net Charge-offs (annualized) 21,663 2,300 Average Total Portfolio Loans 3,539,833 3,324,757 Net Charge-offs to Average Portfolio Loans 0.61 0.07 
 See the Credit Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses sections within this MD A for an analysis of the factors that drove the changes in the ACL ratios presented in the previous table. 
 The (recovery) provision for credit losses, which includes a (recovery) provision for losses on loans and a provision (recovery) on unfunded commitments, is a charge to earnings to maintain the ACL at a level consistent with management's assessment of expected losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The (recovery) provision for credit losses decreased 1.5 million and 2.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively when compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in the (recovery) provision for credit losses for the quarterly comparison was primarily driven by the updated analysis of the individually evaluated loans, within the Other loan segment and 1.7 million of other segment reserves released related to the aforementioned 13.2 million of curtailment payments made by the Bank s largest nonperforming relationship, offset by loan growth in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the (recovery) provision for credit losses, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily driven by the aforementioned 3.1 million of other segment reserves released related to the aforementioned 21.0 million of curtailment payments, offset by loan growth in 2024. For more information about the Company s provision for credit losses, see the discussion above under Provision for Credit Losses in this MD A. 
 The provision (recovery) for unfunded commitments increased 0.3 million and decreased 0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was due to increased commitments in construction loans during the third quarter of 2024. The reserve for unfunded commitments is largely comprised of unfunded commitments related to real estate construction loans and pressure on the reserve rates. There are three basic factors that influence the reserve rates associated with unfunded commitments for real estate construction loans. First, the reserve rate is extrapolated from the reserve rates calculated for certain commercial real estate funded loans within the ACL model. These reserve rates are influenced by the same factors cited in the ACL model such as economic forecasts, average portfolio life, etc. Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to the ACL Policy and the discussion of these factors. Second, since the category of construction is generic, management applies a weighting of the reserve rates associated with certain commercial real estate loans. The proportion of these segments affect the weighting. Third, volume changes impact the total reserve calculation. 
 Net charge-offs were 15.3 million and 16.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.8 million and 2.0 million for the same periods in 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs were significantly impacted by the 15.0 million principal charge-off related to the Other segment of the loan portfolio. Certain Justice Entities executed a promissory note related to the Settlement Payment. This promissory note was 
 60 

Table of Contents

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued) 

 recognized as a principal charge-off due to the nonperforming status of the Bank s loans with the Justice Entities and because the settled claims related to allegedly preferential payments made on those nonperforming loans. As a percentage of average portfolio loans, on an annualized basis, net charge-offs were 1.71 and 0.61 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.09 and 0.08 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Nonperforming loans remained significantly elevated at 287.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and 309.5 million as of December 31, 2023 due principally to the aggregate balance of the nonperforming loans associated with the Bank s largest lending relationship that was placed on nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2023. The balance of that relationship has declined from 301.9 million December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 to 280.9 million as of September 30, 2024. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total portfolio loans were 8.00 and 8.83 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decline in nonperforming loans is primarily due to 21.0 million in total payments received during the second and third quarters of 2024 on the Bank s largest nonperforming lending relationship, which payments reduced the Bank s amortized cost associated with those nonperforming loans and were made pursuant to the pathway of curtailment and payoff of the outstanding nonperforming loan agreed between the relevant borrowers and the Bank. For more information about the Company s nonperforming loans and about this lending relationship, see the discussion above under Credit Quality in this MD A.

 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no loans that were risk rated as doubtful. Special mention and substandard loans at September 30, 2024 decreased 17.5 million compared to December 31, 2023, with a decrease of 14.0 million in substandard and a decrease of 3.5 million in special mention. The decrease of 14.0 million in substandard was primarily related to the aforementioned 21.0 million of curtailment payments received in the second and third quarters of 2024 in the Other segment category. Partially offsetting the curtailment payments were loan downgrades to substandard consisting of two CRE loans and two C I loan relationships totaling 9.0 million, during the second and third quarters of 2024. The decrease in substandard loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by a 1.1 million mortgage loan that was resolved during the first quarter of 2024, as well as two loans, one of which was a CRE loan and the other was a construction loan, totaling 1.1 million that were moved to OREO during the first quarter of 2024. At September 30, 2024 and

 Deposits 
 The following table presents the composition of deposits for the periods presented: 
 (Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Change Noninterest-Bearing Demand 628,901 685,218 (56,317) (8.2) Interest-Bearing Demand 649,005 481,506 167,499 34.8 Money Market 504,206 513,664 (9,458) (1.8) Savings 372,881 454,876 (81,995) (18.0) Certificates of Deposit 1,930,075 1,586,651 343,424 21.6 Total Deposits 4,085,068 3,721,915 363,153 9.8 
 Deposits are the Company s primary source of funds. The Company believes that the deposit base is stable and that the Company has the ability to attract new depositors while diversifying the deposit composition. Total deposits at September 30, 2024 increased 363.2 million, or 13.0 on an annualized basis, from December 31, 2023. The variance related to an increase of 343.4 million in CDs, which includes an increase of 146.1 million in brokered CDs, and an increase of 167.5 million in interest-bearing demand accounts, offset by a decrease of 82.0 million in savings accounts, a decrease of 56.3 million in noninterest-bearing demand accounts and a decrease of 9.4 million in money market accounts. The Company had 216.1 million brokered CDs at September 30, 2024, compared to 70.0 million at December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits comprised 15.4 of total deposits compared to 18.4 at December 31, 2023 and 18.7 at September 30, 2023. CDs comprised 47.2 , 42.6 and 42.5 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, based on assumptions that the Bank uses to prepare its regulatory call report, approximately 82.7 of our total deposits of 4.1 billion were insured under standard FDIC insurance coverage limits, and approximately 17.3 of our total deposits were uninsured deposits over the standard FDIC insurance coverage limit. The Company s deposit base is diversified and granular and is comprised of approximately 78.5 of retail deposits.

 Borrowings and Federal Funds Purchased 
 Borrowings are an additional source of liquidity for the Company. FHLB borrowings decreased 303.4 million to 90.0 million at September 30, 2024 and were 393.4 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decline in overnight borrowings, coupled with 146.1 million of new brokered CDs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company used liquidity provided by deposit growth to reduce outstanding FHLB borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company had no overnight federal funds purchased at September 30, 2024 or at December 31, 2023. The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan growth, investment securities, deposits growth and capital considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity. 
 Information pertaining to FHLB borrowings and federal funds purchased is summarized in the following table: 
 (Dollars in Thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Balance at Period End Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings 90,000 393,400 Federal Funds Purchased Average Balance during the Period Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings 273,413 402,675 Federal Funds Purchased 7,023 Average Interest Rate during the Period Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings 5.20 5.17 Federal Funds Purchased 5.24 Maximum Month-end Balance during the Period Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings 403,000 525,135 Federal Funds Purchased 46,965 Average Interest Rate at Period End Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings 4.30 5.20 Federal Funds Purchased 
 The Company held FHLB of Atlanta stock of 7.4 million and 21.6 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in FHLB stock was due to a lower required level of stock holdings due to a lower level of FHLB borrowings. Dividends recorded on restricted stock were 0.2 million and 0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.4 million and 1.0 million for the same periods in 2023. The investment is carried at cost and evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. We hold FHLB stock because we are a member of the FHLB of Atlanta. The FHLB requires members to purchase and hold a specified level of FHLB stock based upon the members asset values, level of borrowings and participation in other programs offered. Stock in the FHLB is non-marketable and is redeemable at the discretion of the FHLB. Members do not purchase stock in the FHLB for the same reasons that traditional equity investors acquire stock in an investor-owned enterprise. Rather, members purchase stock to obtain access to the products and services offered by the FHLB. Unlike equity securities of traditional for-profit enterprises, the stock of the FHLB does not provide its holders with an opportunity for capital appreciation because, by regulation, FHLB stock can only be purchased, redeemed and transferred at par value. 
 Refer to Note 9, Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings and Federal Funds Purchased, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to borrowings. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is defined as a financial institution s ability to meet its cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost. This includes the ability to satisfy the financial needs of depositors who want to withdraw funds or borrowers needing to access funds to meet their credit needs. In order to manage liquidity risk the Company s Board has delegated authority to ALCO for formulation, implementation and oversight of liquidity risk management for the Company. The ALCO s goal is to maintain adequate levels of liquidity at a reasonable cost to meet funding needs in both a normal operating environment and for potential liquidity stress events. The ALCO closely monitors and manages liquidity by reviewing cash flow projections, performing balance sheet stress tests and by maintaining a detailed contingency funding plan that includes specific liquidity measures that 
 63 

Table of Contents 
 CARTER BANKSHARES, INC. 
 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued) 

 are reviewed by the ALCO monthly. Our liquidity policy and contingency funding plan provide graduated risk tolerance levels for multiple liquidity measures and potential liquidity environments. If our liquidity position moves to a level that has been defined as high risk, specific actions are required, such as increased monitoring or the development of an action plan to reduce the risk position. 
 The Company s primary funding and liquidity source is a stable customer deposit base. Management believes that we have the ability to retain existing deposits and attract new deposits, mitigating any potential funding dependency on other more volatile sources. Although deposits are the primary source of funds, the Company has identified various other funding sources that can be used as part of our normal funding program when either a structure or cost efficiency has been identified. Additional funding sources accessible to the Company include borrowing availability at the FHLB, equal to 25.0 of the Company s assets or approximating 1.2 billion, subject to the amount of eligible collateral pledged, of which the Company is eligible to borrow up to an additional 791.4 million. The Company has unsecured facilities with three other correspondent financial institutions totaling 30.0 million, a fully secured facility with one other correspondent financial institution totaling 45.0 million, and access to the institutional CD market, and the brokered deposit market. The Company did not have outstanding borrowings on these fed funds lines as of September 30, 2024. In addition to the above funding resources, the Company also has 433.3 million of unpledged available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value, as an additional source of liquidity. Please refer to the Liquidity Sources table below for available funding with the FHLB and our secured and unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 82.7 of our total deposits of 4.1 billion were insured under standard FDIC insurance coverage limits, and approximately 17.3 of our total deposits were uninsured deposits over the standard FDIC insurance coverage limit. 
 The Company closely monitors changes in the industry and market conditions that may impact the Company s liquidity and will use other borrowing means or other liquidity and funding strategies sources to fund its liquidity needs as needed. The Company is also closely tracking the potential impacts on the Company s liquidity of declines in the fair value of the Company s securities portfolio due to rising market interest rates and developments in the banking industry that may change the availability of traditional sources of liquidity or market expectations with respect to available sources and amounts of additional liquidity. 
 An important component of our ability to effectively respond to potential liquidity stress events is maintaining a cushion of highly liquid assets. Highly liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly, with little or no loss in value, to meet financial obligations. ALCO policy guidelines define a ratio of highly liquid assets to total assets by graduated risk tolerance levels of minimal, moderate and high. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had 495.3 million in highly liquid assets, which consisted of Federal Reserve Board Excess Reserves and interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions of 61.6 million, 433.3 million in unpledged securities and 0.4 million in loans held-for-sale. This resulted in highly liquid assets to total assets ratio of 10.7 at September 30, 2024. Total available liquidity to uninsured deposits was 207.8 at September 30, 2024. 
 If an extended recession, or significant industry or market volatility, caused large numbers of our deposit customers to withdraw their funds, we might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.

 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 Total capital of 386.8 million at September 30, 2024, reflects an increase of 35.6 million compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total capital from December 31, 2023 is primarily due to net income of 16.2 million, an increase of 18.1 million in other comprehensive loss due to changes in fair value of investment securities, as well as an increase of 1.3 million related to restricted stock activity all during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to various capital requirements administered by the federal banking regulators. Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies. Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios. 
 Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution s category. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Bank continues to maintain its capital position with a leverage ratio of 9.45 as compared to the regulatory guideline of 5.00 to be well-capitalized and a risk-based Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.75 compared to the regulatory guideline of 6.50 to be well-capitalized. The Bank s risk-based Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios were 10.75 and 12.01 , respectively, which places the Bank above the federal bank regulatory agencies well-capitalized guidelines of 8.00 and 10.00 , respectively. We believe that we have the ability to raise additional capital, if necessary. 
 The Basel rules permit banking organizations with less than 15.0 billion in assets to retain, through a one-time election, existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive loss, which currently does not affect regulatory capital. The Company elected to retain this treatment which reduces the volatility of regulatory capital levels. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios, along with a capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in new minimum capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum, but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a countercyclical capital buffer that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to the Company or the Bank.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk is defined as the degree to which changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices can adversely affect a financial institution s earnings or capital. For financial institutions, market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending, investment, and deposit-taking activities. Interest rate risk can arise from timing differences in the repricing and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (repricing risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers ability to prepay home mortgage loans at any time, depositors ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve, where interest rates increase or decrease in a non-parallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and SOFR (basis risk). 
 Interest rate fluctuations affect earnings by changing net interest income and other interest-sensitive income and expense levels. Interest rate changes affect capital by changing the net present value of a financial institution s future cash flows, and the cash flows themselves, as rates change. Accepting this risk is a normal part of banking and can be an important source of profitability and enhancement of shareholder value. However, excessive interest rate risk can threaten a financial institution s earnings, capital, liquidity, and solvency. The Company s ALCO is responsible for the reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the institution, establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this type of risk, and employing strategies to ensure our asset-liability structure produces the maximum yield-cost spread available based on current market conditions. The Company s Investment / Interest Rate Risk Committee, a committee of the Board of Directors, reviews and approves the policies established by ALCO.

 Earnings Simulation Modeling 
 The ALCO uses an asset liability model ALM to forecast earning simulations that measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. The ALM calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates. This method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that support the ALM process. The ALCO derives the assumptions used in the ALM from historical trends and management s outlook, including expected loan growth, loan prepayment rates, deposit growth rates, changes to deposit product betas and non-maturity deposit decay rates, and projected yields and rates. The ALM assumes that all maturities, calls, and prepayments in the securities portfolio are reinvested in like instruments. These assumptions may not be realized and unanticipated events and circumstances may also occur that cause the assumptions to be inaccurate. The ALM also does not take into account any future actions management may take to mitigate the impact of unforeseen interest rate changes. A sensitivity analysis for deposit betas, deposit decay rates and loan prepayment speeds is performed at least annually within the ALM to help ALCO better understand the impact of these critical assumptions on the ALM results. The ALCO reviews the assumptions of the ALM at least quarterly and periodically adjusts them when deemed appropriate. 
 The ALCO also uses different interest rate scenarios and shifts in yield curve shapes to measure the sensitivity of earnings to various interest rate environments. Interest rates on unique asset and liability accounts move differently when the short-term market rate changes. These differences are reflected in the different rate scenarios utilized by the ALM. For earning simulations, our policy guidelines limit the change in net interest income over a 12-month and 24-month horizon using rate shocks of +/- 100, 200, 300, 400 basis points and for non-parallel yield curve shift scenarios. We have temporarily suspended the + 300 and + 400 basis point rate shock analyses. Due to the FOMC s recent action to reduce the Fed Funds Target Rate range by 50 bps from 5.25 - 5.50 to 4.75 - 5.00 effective September 18, 2024 coupled with current rate forecasts that imply that the FOMC will continue reducing the Fed Funds Target Rate during the fourth quarter of 2024 and well into 2025, we believe the impact to net interest income when evaluating the + 300 and +400 basis point rate shock scenarios do not provide meaningful insight into our interest rate risk position nor does it project a probable interest rate environment for the foreseeable future. 
 The following tables reflect the earnings simulation results for the periods presented utilizing a forecasted static balance sheet over the next twelve months. All percentage changes presented are within prescribed ranges set by ALCO. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change in Interest Rate (basis points) Change in Pretax Net Interest Income Change in Pretax Net Interest Income 200 3.9 (1.1) 100 2.1 (0.3) -100 1.2 2.4 -200 2.5 4.4 -300 3.1 5.6 -400 2.6 6.7 
 The results from the earnings simulation imply that the Company s assets and liabilities are relatively evenly matched to allow for net interest income margin expansion in rising and falling interest rate environments at September 30, 2024 versus being liability sensitive at December 31, 2023. The above table indicates that as of September 30, 2024 the Company s balance sheet is positioned to produce a modest increase in pre-tax net interest income in both a rising and falling interest rate environment principally due to the current balance sheet composition, related maturity structures, interest rate hedges entered into during the third quarter and dynamic repricing correlations to market interest rates for both assets and liabilities. 
 Economic Value of Equity Modeling 
 Economic value of equity simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. The ALM calculates the economic value of equity based on discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. The change in net economic value of equity over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term earnings capability of the balance sheet. The Company uses the same assumptions in the economic value of equity simulation model as in the earnings simulation model. The economic value of equity simulation model uses instantaneous rate shocks to the balance sheet. For economic value of equity simulation, our policy guidelines limit the change in economic value of equity given changes in rates of +/- 100, 200, 300, 400 basis points and for non-parallel yield curve shift scenarios. We have temporarily suspended the + 300 and + 400 basis

 point rate shock analyses. Due to the FOMC s recent action to reduce the Fed Funds Target Rate range by 50 bps from 5.25 - 5.50 to 4.75 - 5.00 effective September 18, 2024 coupled with current rate forecasts that imply that the FOMC will continue reducing the Fed Funds Target Rate during the fourth quarter of 2024 and well into 2025, we believe the impact to net interest income when evaluating the + 300 and +400 basis point rate shock scenarios do not provide meaningful insight into our interest rate risk position nor does it project a probable interest rate environment for the foreseeable future. 
 Results for the economic value of equity modeling are driven primarily by the shape of the underlying yield curves and option-adjusted spreads used to discount the projected cash flows of assets and liabilities, and the assumed life span of the assets and liabilities being discounted. 
 The following tables reflect the economic value of equity analyses results for the periods presented. All percentage changes presented are within prescribed ranges set by management.

 ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO (its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our CEO and CFO as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based on and as of the date of such evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No changes were made to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
