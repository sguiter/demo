 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDIN G FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, expect, anticipate, project, target, estimate, intend, continue or believe or the negatives of, or other variations on, these terms or comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations concerning our business, operating results, financial condition and other similar matters. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors. Our forward-looking statements include information in this report regarding general domestic and global economic conditions, our future financing plans, our ability to operate as a business development company BDC and the expected performance of, and the yield on, our portfolio companies. There may be events in the future, however, that we are not able to predict accurately or control. The factors listed under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as any cautionary language in this report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date of this report. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this quarterly report because we are an investment company. The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: 
 
 our future operating results; 

disruptions in the capital markets, market conditions, and general economic uncertainty; 

changes in political, economic, social or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, including the effect of any pandemic or epidemic;

Accelerated amortization of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts 

Fees received from portfolio companies (directors fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) are paid to the Company, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, the Company only receives its allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as another Account (as defined below) managed by the Investment Adviser. Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any. Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind PIK interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the principal amount or shares (if equity) of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon the investment being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income. Certain structuring fees, amendment fees, syndication fees and commitment fees are recorded as other income when earned. Administrative agent fees received by the Company are recorded as other income when the services are rendered over time.

Incentive Fee The Incentive Fee consists of components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not.

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company have not yet received in cash.

The Company will pay the Investment Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized);

Co-Investment Activity In certain circumstances, the Company can make negotiated co-investments pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to do so. On November 16, 2022, the SEC granted to the Investment Adviser, the BDCs advised by the Investment Adviser and certain other affiliated applicants exemptive relief on which the Company expects to rely to co-invest alongside certain other client accounts managed by the Investment Adviser (collectively with the Company, the Accounts ), which may include proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs, in a manner consistent with the Company's investment objectives and strategies, certain Board-established criteria, the conditions of such exemptive relief and other pertinent factors (as amended, the Relief ). On June 25, 2024, the SEC granted an amendment to the Relief, which permits the Company to participate in follow-on investments in the Company s existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates covered by the Relief if such affiliates, that are not BDCs or registered investment companies, have an investment in such existing portfolio company. Additionally, if the Investment Adviser forms other funds in the future, the Company may co-invest alongside such other affiliates, subject to compliance with the Relief, applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. As a result of the Relief, there could be significant overlap in the Company s investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of other Accounts, including, in some cases, proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs. The Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit Team is composed of investment professionals dedicated to the Company s investment strategy and to other funds that share a similar investment strategy with the Company. The Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit Team is responsible for identifying investment opportunities, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments, negotiating and structuring the Company s investments and monitoring and servicing the Company s investments. The team works together with investment professionals who are primarily focused on investment strategies in syndicated, liquid credit.

As noted above, the income and market approaches were used in the determination of fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the discount rate or market yield used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. An increase in the discount rate or market yield would result in a decrease in the fair value. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates or market yields is risk of default, rating of the investment, call provisions and comparable company investments. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach are based on market comparable transactions and market multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. Increase in market comparable transactions or market multiples would result in an increase in the fair value.

Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are a specialty finance company that is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). In addition, we intend to elect to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC ), and we expect to qualify annually for tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2023. From our commencement of investment operations on April 6, 2023 through September 30, 2024, we have originated approximately 6.54 billion in aggregate principal amount of Private Credit Investments (as defined below) and related equity prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. Our investment strategy is consistent with that of the broader Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit platform, with a focus on capital preservation and capital appreciation, and includes: 
 Leveraging Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit s position within Goldman Sachs; 

Direct origination with borrowers; 

Prudent investment selection with intensive due diligence and credit analysis; 

Provision of large-sized commitments; 

Structuring expertise with a focus on risk mitigation; 

Rigorous portfolio management; and 

Focus on companies with attractive business fundamentals. 

Under normal circumstances, we will invest at least 80 of our total assets (which include net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in private credit instruments, which may include loans, notes, bonds and other corporate debt securities issued by corporate issuers Private Credit Investments ). If we change our 80 requirement, we will provide stockholders with at least 60 days notice of such change. 
 We primarily hold directly originated, first lien senior secured, floating rate debt of companies located primarily in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We may also invest, to a lesser extent, in second lien loans, unsecured, subordinated or PIK debt and equity and equity-like instruments. We also invest a portion of our portfolio in more liquid investments Liquid Investments ), such as broadly syndicated loans and other fixed-income securities, to provide the portfolio with additional liquidity. 
 We invest primarily in private companies based in the United States, but we also invest, to a lesser extent, in non-U.S. based companies (subject to compliance with BDC requirements to invest at least 70 of our assets in U.S. companies). We focus our lending across a spectrum of directly sourced opportunities in companies ranging from lower middle market to large capitalization in size. We may invest in companies of any size or capitalization. 
 We generally lead the origination of our investments as the primary lender, and we may participate in club deals (which are generally investments made by a small group of firms). Subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other Goldman Sachs credit funds or affiliates. We also invest alongside institutional and retail-focused private credit Accounts, which may include proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs. For additional information, see Item 1. Business Allocation of Investment Opportunities Co-Investments Alongside Goldman Sachs and Other Accounts, and the Relief in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, we expect to acquire or originate revolving credit facilities from time to time in connection with our investments in other assets.

Table of Contents 

 Our investment strategy also allocates a portion of the overall portfolio to Liquid Investments to provide the portfolio with additional liquidity and to manage our payment obligations under our share repurchase program. Liquid Investments may include senior secured loans, senior secured high yield bonds, senior unsecured high yield bonds, and fixed-income ETFs and government securities. We use these investments to maintain liquidity for our share repurchase program and manage cash before investing subscription proceeds into originated loans, while also seeking attractive investment returns. Prior to raising or investing sufficient capital, the portfolio may display a greater percentage of assets within Liquid Investments or government securities than we otherwise would expect for a fully invested portfolio. Investment decisions related to Liquid Investments are made by the Goldman Sachs Asset Management High Yield and Bank Loan team within the Global Fixed Income and Liquidity Solutions group of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. 
 We employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of the Investment Adviser, but we intend to comply with the limitations set forth in the Investment Company Act, which currently allows us to borrow up to 2 of debt for each 1 of equity. We intend to use leverage in the form of borrowings, including loans from financial institutions as well as the issuance of debt securities. We may also use leverage in the form of preferred shares. In determining whether to borrow money, we will analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. We would expect any such leverage, if incurred, to increase the total capital available for investment by us. 
 For a discussion of the competitive landscape we face, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Relating to Competition We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and Item 1. Business Competitive Advantages in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 KEY COMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, fee income and capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK income. We expect that the principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally will become due at the maturity date. 
 We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring, syndication, exit fees or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Portfolio company fees (directors fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) will be paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, we receive our allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as other Accounts. We do not expect to receive material fee income as it is not our principal investment strategy. We record contractual prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments, if any, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments, if any, is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of a management fee (the Management Fee and an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee to our Investment Adviser, legal and other professional fees, interest and other debt expenses and other operating related expenses. The Management Fee and Incentive Fee compensate our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, structuring, and monitoring our investments. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including in accordance with the Investment Management Agreement. 
 Our Investment Adviser pays all costs incurred by it in connection with the performance of its duties under the Investment Management Agreement. Our Investment Adviser pays the compensation and expenses of all its personnel and makes available, without expense to us, the services of such of its partners, officers and employees as may duly be elected as our officers or directors, subject to their individual consent to serve and to any limitations imposed by law. Our Investment Adviser is not required to pay any of our expenses other than those specifically allocated to it, including as set forth below. In particular, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, our Investment Adviser is not required to pay: 
 organization and offering expenses associated with the private offering of our Class I stock, par value 0.001 per share (the Shares and other securities (including legal, accounting, printing, mailing, subscription processing and filing fees and expenses and other offering expenses, including costs associated with technology integration between the Company s systems and those of participating intermediaries, reasonable bona fide due diligence expenses of participating intermediaries supported by detailed and itemized invoices, costs in connection with preparing sales materials and other marketing expenses, design and website expenses, fees and expenses of GS Co., the Company s transfer agent (the Transfer Agent ), fees to attend retail seminars sponsored by participating intermediaries, if any, and costs, expenses and reimbursements for travel, meals, accommodations, entertainment and other similar expenses related to meetings or events with prospective investors, intermediaries, registered investment advisors or

the cost of preparing share certificates or any other expenses, including clerical expenses of issue, redemption or repurchase of our Shares; 

the expenses of and fees for registering or qualifying our Shares for sale and of maintaining our federal and/or state registration or exemptions, and registering us as a broker or a dealer, as applicable; 

the fees and expenses of our directors (the Directors who are not affiliated with our Investment Adviser; 

the cost of preparing and distributing reports, proxy statements and notices to our stockholders, the SEC and other regulatory authorities; 

costs of holding stockholder meetings; 

the fees or disbursements of custodians of our assets, including expenses incurred in the performance of any obligations enumerated by our certificate of incorporation or bylaws insofar as they govern agreements with any such custodian; 

insurance premiums; or 

costs incurred in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration, mediation, government investigation or dispute in connection with our business and the amount of any judgment or settlement paid in connection therewith, or the enforcement of our rights against any person and indemnification or contribution expenses payable by us to any person and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of our business. 

Our Investment Adviser is also not required to pay expenses of activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of our Shares, including all costs and expenses associated with the preparation and distribution of any private placement memorandum, subscription agreements, registration statements, prospectuses or stockholder application forms, including any amendments, restatements and/or supplements thereto. 
 Our Investment Adviser may impose a voluntary cap on the amount of expenses that will be borne by us on a monthly or annual basis. Any such expense cap may be increased, decreased, waived or eliminated at any time at our Investment Adviser s sole discretion. 
 To the extent that expenses to be borne by us pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement are paid by our Investment Adviser, we will reimburse our Investment Adviser for such expenses, provided, however, that our Investment Adviser may elect, from time to time and in its sole discretion, to bear certain of our expenses set forth above, including organizational and other expenses. 
 With respect to the expenses of the private offering of Shares, the Investment Adviser has agreed to advance all of our organization, offering and other operating expenses on our behalf through the date on which we broke escrow for the private offering of the Shares. Pursuant to the expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement, dated as of March 20, 2023 (the Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with the Investment Adviser, the Investment Adviser may elect to pay certain of our expenses on our behalf, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense or distribution and/or stockholder servicing fees of the Company. We may reimburse the Investment Adviser for such advanced expenses only if certain conditions are met. See Note 3 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Any reimbursements will not exceed actual expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates. 
 From time to time, Goldman Sachs Asset Management (in its capacity as the Investment Adviser) or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse Goldman Sachs Asset Management (in its capacity as the Investment Adviser) or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, Goldman Sachs Asset Management (in its capacity as the Investment Adviser) may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our stockholders. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. 
 Leverage 
 As a BDC, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage ratio, as defined under the Investment Company Act, is at least equal to 150 immediately after each such issuance. The Small Business Credit Availability Act modified the applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act to reduce the required asset coverage ratio applicable to BDCs from 200 to 150 , subject to certain approval and disclosure requirements. Our board of directors (the Board of Directors or the Board and initial member approved the application of the 150 asset coverage ratio to us in accordance 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 with the requirements of the Investment Company Act. While the leverage we employ may be greater or less than these levels from time to time, we intend to comply with the limitations set forth in the Investment Company Act, which currently allows us to borrow up to 2 of debt for each 1 of equity. In addition, except in limited circumstances, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or stock unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. A loan is presumed to be made for temporary purposes if it is repaid within 60 days and is not extended or renewed; otherwise, it is presumed not to be for temporary purposes. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters Regulations governing our operations as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. These constraints may hinder our Investment Adviser s ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and to achieve our investment objective in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of the Investment Adviser, but we intend to comply with the limitations set forth in the Investment Company Act, which currently allows us to borrow up to 2 of debt for each 1 of equity. We use leverage in the form of borrowings, including loans from financial institutions as well as the issuance of debt securities. We also use leverage in the form of preferred shares. In determining whether to borrow money, we analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. We expect any such leverage, if incurred, to increase the total capital available for investment by the Company. 
 Our leverage may take the form of revolving or term loans from financial institutions, such as the Truist Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), the BNPP Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), and the MS Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below, and together with the Truist Revolving Credit Facility and the BNPP Revolving Credit Facility, collectively, the Revolving Credit Facilities ), debt securities, such as secured or unsecured bonds, securitization of portions of our investment portfolio, preferred shares and/or reverse repurchase agreements (including short term participations or pledges of our directly originated debt positions). The Revolving Credit Facilities and other leverage techniques described herein allow us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as leverage. In determining whether to borrow money, we will analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. The use of leverage magnifies returns, including losses. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered borrowings or involve leverage and thus may be subject to Investment Company Act restrictions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered borrowings are not subject to the Investment Company Act s asset coverage requirement. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on the assessment by our Investment Adviser and our Board of Directors of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.

The decrease in total portfolio weighted average yield at amortized cost and fair value, within First Lien/Senior Secured Debt weighted average yield at amortized cost and fair value, and within First Lien/Last-Out Unitranche weighted average yield at amortized cost, was due to a decline in interest rates. 
 The weighted average yield of our Liquid Investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 8.2 and 9.4 at amortized cost and 8.4 and 9.2 at fair value. The decrease in weighted average yield at amortized cost was due to a decline in interest rates.

(3) Includes all Private Credit Investments for which fair value is determined by the Investment Adviser, as the valuation designee (the Valuation Designee designated by the Board of Directors, pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act. Figures are derived from the financial statements most recently validated by the Adviser. LTV is calculated as net debt through each respective loan tranche divided by estimated enterprise value or value of the underlying collateral of the portfolio company. Weighted average LTV is weighted based on the fair value of the total applicable private debt investments. 

(4) Includes all Private Credit Investments for which fair value is determined by the Investment Adviser, as the Valuation Designee designated by the Board of Directors, pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act. For a particular portfolio company, we calculate the level of contractual indebtedness net of cash net debt owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to measures of cash flow available to service the net debt. To calculate net debt, we include debt that is both senior and pari passu to the tranche of debt owned by us but exclude debt that is legally and contractually subordinated in ranking to the debt owned by us. We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual rights of repayment of the tranche of debt owned by us relative to other senior and junior creditors of a portfolio company. We typically calculate cash flow available for debt service at a portfolio company by taking EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month period. Weighted average net debt to EBITDA is weighted based on the fair value of our applicable Private Credit Investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 

For a particular portfolio company, we also calculate the level of contractual interest expense owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to EBITDA interest coverage ratio ). We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual interest obligations of the portfolio company. Weighted average interest coverage is weighted based on the fair value of our applicable performing Private Credit Investments, excluding investments where interest coverage may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 
 Median EBITDA is based on our applicable Private Credit Investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 
 Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the reported end date. Statistics of the portfolio companies have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk represented 12.9 and 26.9 of total Private Credit Investments at fair value. 
 Our Investment Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company on an ongoing basis to determine if it is meeting its respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each portfolio company. Our Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include: (i) assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; (ii) periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; (iii) comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; (iv) attendance at and participation in Board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and (v) review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies.

Table of Contents 

 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser also employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Investment Adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grading system for our investments is as follows: 
 Grade 1 investments involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit; 

Grade 2 investments involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 2; 

Grade 3 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due; and 

Grade 4 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 4, in most cases, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 4, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 

Our Investment Adviser grades the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments graded 3 or 4, the Investment Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. The following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 4 grading scale:

Investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to the contractual terms. Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in management s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to this treatment if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our primary use of funds is for our investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate purposes, including paying for operating expenses or debt service to the extent we borrow or issue senior securities. 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 We expect to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of any future offerings of securities, future borrowings and cash flows from operations. To the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our Board of Directors otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders, we may enter into credit facilities in addition to the Revolving Credit Facilities, or issue other senior securities. We would expect any such credit facilities may be secured by certain of our assets and may contain advance rates based upon pledged collateral. The pricing and other terms of any such facilities would depend upon market conditions when we enter into any such facilities as well as the performance of our business, among other factors. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we are only permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). See Key Components of Operations Leverage. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio based on the aggregate amount outstanding of our senior securities (which includes our Revolving Credit Facilities) was 365 and 741 . We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions. 
 We may enter into investment commitments through signed commitment letters that may ultimately become investment transactions in the future. We regularly evaluate and carefully consider our unfunded commitments using GSAM s proprietary risk management framework for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity, including our financial leverage. 
 An affiliate of the Investment Adviser made an initial capital contribution to us of one thousand dollars and became our initial member. On April 6, 2023, the date of the initial closing of the private offering of our Shares, the equity interest of the initial member was cancelled.

 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan (the DRIP ), pursuant to which we reinvest all distributions declared by the Board on behalf of our stockholders who do not elect to receive their distributions in cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash distribution or other distribution, then our stockholders who have not opted out of our DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares, rather than receiving the cash distribution or other distribution. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with Goldman Sachs Asset Management (in its capacity as the Investment Adviser) to provide us with investment advisory services and the Administration Agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (in its capacity as the administrator, the Administrator to provide us with administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the Investment Management Agreement are described in Item 1. Business Investment Management Agreement in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We may establish credit facilities in addition to the Truist Revolving Credit Facility, BNPP Revolving Credit Facility and MS Revolving Credit Facility or enter into other financing arrangements to facilitate investments and the timely payment of our expenses. It is anticipated that any such credit facilities will bear interest at floating rates at to-be-determined spreads over SOFR (or other applicable reference rate). We cannot assure stockholders that we will be able to enter into a credit facility on favorable terms or at all. In connection with a credit facility or other borrowings, lenders may require us to pledge assets, commitments and/or drawdowns (and the ability to enforce the payment thereof) and may ask us to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. 
 We entered into multiple purchase agreements (as amended, the Purchase Agreements with Macquarie Bank Limited (the Financing Provider and an affiliate of the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which we purchased certain investments (the Portfolio Investments from the Financing Provider at the prices determined under the Purchase Agreements.

Series A Preferred Stock 
 On April 6, 2023, we issued and sold 515 shares of Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value of 0.001 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock ), at a price of 1,000 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of 0.52 million. We redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock on September 28, 2023.

 Distributions, including the payment of dividends and distribution of our assets upon dissolution, liquidation, or winding up, on the Series A Preferred Stock were senior to all other classes and series of our common stock to the extent of the aggregate liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock 1,000 per share, or the Liquidation Value and all accrued but unpaid distributions and any applicable redemption premium on the Series A Preferred Stock. Distributions on each share of the Series A Preferred Stock were payable semiannually on June 30 and December 31 of each year and accrued at the rate of 12.0 per annum of the sum of the Liquidation Value thereof plus all accumulated and unpaid distribution thereon, from and including the date of issuance to and including the earlier of (1) the date of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up or (2) the date on which such share of Series A Preferred Stock is redeemed. Such distributions were generally cumulative with the result that all accrued and unpaid distributions would have been required to be fully paid or declared with funds irrevocably set apart for payment for all past distribution periods before any distribution or payment could have been made to holders of outstanding shares of our common stock. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to investment commitments and to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to fund investments and to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, we believed that we had adequate financial resources to satisfy our unfunded commitments. Our unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies were as follows:

Warehouse Transaction 
 We entered into the Warehouse Transaction, whereby we agreed, subject to certain conditions, to purchase certain investments (the Portfolio Investments from a party unaffiliated with the Investment Adviser. The Warehouse Transaction was designed to assist us in deploying capital upon receipt of subscriptions. On April 10, 2023, we purchased the Portfolio Investments. The Portfolio Investments primarily consisted of newly originated, privately negotiated senior secured term loans to middle market companies consistent with our investment strategy. For additional information, see Note 11 Warehouse Transaction in our consolidated financial statements. Although there can be no assurances, we may in the future enter into additional warehousing transactions from time to time, with third parties, subject to compliance with the Investment Company Act. 
 HEDGING 
 Subject to applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and applicable Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC regulations, we may enter into hedging transactions in a manner consistent with SEC guidance. To the extent that any of our loans are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, we may enter into currency hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We may also enter into interest rate hedging agreements. Such hedging activities, which will be subject to compliance with applicable legal requirements, may include the use of futures, options, swaps and forward contracts. Costs incurred in entering into such contracts or in settling them, if any, will be borne by us. Our Investment Adviser has claimed no-action relief from CFTC registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator pursuant to a CFTC Rule 4.5 with respect to our operations, with the result that we will be limited in our ability to use futures contracts or options on futures contracts or engage in swap transactions. Specifically, CFTC Rule 4.5 imposes strict limitations on using such derivatives other than for hedging purposes, whereby the use of derivatives not used solely for hedging purposes is generally limited to situations where (i) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish such positions does not exceed five percent of the liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such contracts it has entered into; or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of such derivatives does not exceed 100 of the liquidation value of our portfolio. Moreover, we anticipate entering into transactions involving such derivatives to a very limited extent solely for hedging purposes or otherwise within the limitations of CFTC Rule 4.5. 
 Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act includes limitations on the ability of a BDC (or a RIC) to use derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations (including reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions). Under the rule, BDCs that make significant use of derivatives are subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, a derivatives risk management program, testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These requirements apply unless the BDC qualifies as a limited derivatives user, as defined in Rule 18f-4. Under the rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment

 agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Under Rule 18f-4, when we trade reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions, including certain tender option bonds, we need to aggregate the amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness (e.g., bank borrowings, if applicable) when calculating our asset coverage ratio. We currently operate as a limited derivatives user and these requirements may limit our ability to use derivatives and/or enter into certain other financial contracts. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Investments, Revenue Recognition, Non-Accrual Investments, Distributions, and Income Taxes. We consider the most significant critical estimate to be the fair value measurement of investments. The critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in connection with our risk factors listed under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Fair Value Measurement of Investments 
 Consistent with GAAP and the Investment Company Act, we conduct a valuation of our investments, pursuant to which our NAV is determined. Our investments are valued on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the Investment Company Act. The determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. The majority of investments are not quoted or traded in an active market, and as such, their fair values are determined using valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flows, market multiples, and recent comparable transactions. The most significant inputs in applying the discounted cash flow approach and the market multiples approach are the selected discount rates and multiples, respectively. The selection of these inputs is based on a combination of factors that are specific to the underlying portfolio companies such as financial performance and certain factors that are observable in the market, such as current interest rates and comparable public company trading multiples. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations on the consolidated financial statements. For further details of our investments and fair value measurement accounting policy, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies Investments and Note 5 Fair Value Measurement.

MS Credit Facility Amendment 
 On October 24, 2024, GSCR Mott Street, entered into the first amendment (the First Amendment to the Loan and Servicing Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2024 (as otherwise amended, supplemented or otherwise modified and in effect from time to time, including by the First Amendment, the MS Revolving Credit Facility by and among GSCR Mott Street, as borrower, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company, as collateral agent, account bank and collateral custodian, the Company, as servicer and as transferor, and the lenders party thereto. 
 The First Amendment, among other things, (i) joined new lenders to the MS Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) created a second tranche of commitments in the amount of 1,000 million (the Tranche B Commitments ), increasing the total facility amount from 1,000 million to 2,000 million in borrowings at any one time outstanding. 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 Advances for the Tranche B Commitments bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the benchmark in effect for the currency of the applicable advance (which in the case of US dollars is 3-month Term SOFR) plus an applicable margin of 2.15 . After the expiration of a two-year reinvestment period, the applicable margin on all outstanding advances will be 2.65 per annum. 
 BNPP Revolving Credit Facility Amendment 
 On October 31, 2024, SPV Public I, our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into the Second Amendment Second Amendment to the BNPP Revolving Credit Facility, dated as of September 29, 2023 (as amended, supplemented, and/or otherwise modified and in effect from time to time, including by the Second Amendment, the BNPP Revolving Credit Facility ), by and among BNP Paribas, as administrative agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company, as collateral agent, us, as equityholder and investment advisor, SPV Public I, as borrower, and the lenders party thereto. 
 The Second Amendment, among other things, (i) increased the aggregate maximum facility amount from 400 million to 900 million, (ii) extended the end of the period in which we may make borrowings under the facility from May 30, 2026 to October 31, 2026, (iii) extended the final maturity date of the facility from May 31, 2027 to November 1, 2027, and (iv) reduced the margin applicable to advances from 1.735 per annum to 1.63 per annum, which applicable margin shall increase to 2.63 per annum after the expiration of the reinvestment period. 
 Truist Revolving Credit Facility Amendment 
 On November 4, 2024, in connection with the Truist Revolving Credit Facility, we exercised its right to request a Commitment Increase and Fifth Third Bank, National Association agreed to participate in an increase of the Multicurrency Commitments from 900 million to 950 million. As a result, the total Commitments under the Truist Revolving Credit Facility increased from 1,180 million to 1,230 million. Pursuant to the accordion feature in the Truist Revolving Credit Facility, the aggregate amount of all Commitments thereunder may be further increased up to 1,770 million. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Truist Revolving Credit Facility. 
 ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 on a fair value basis, 100 and 100 of our performing debt investments bore interest at a floating rate. Our borrowings under the Truist Revolving Credit Facility, the BNPP Revolving Credit Facility, the MS Revolving Credit Facility and Short-Term Borrowings each bear interest at a floating rate. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure.

We may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, applicable CFTC regulations and in a manner consistent with SEC guidance. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates.

Table of Contents 

 We plan to invest primarily in illiquid debt securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Investment Adviser, as our Valuation Designee, pursuant to procedures adopted by the Investment Adviser, as our Valuation Designee, subject to the oversight of the Board in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Our investment strategy will also allocate a portion of the overall portfolio to Liquid Investments, such as broadly syndicated loans and other fixed-income securities, to provide the portfolio with additional liquidity and to manage our payment obligations under our share repurchase program. Investment decisions related to Liquid Investments, such as broadly syndicated loans and other fixed-income securities, will be made by the Goldman Sachs Asset Management High Yield and Bank Loan team within the Global Fixed Income and Liquidity Solutions group of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us.

Each of the above issuances and sales of our Shares was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D or Regulation S under the Securities Act, as applicable. Each purchaser of the Shares was required to represent that it (i) is either an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act or, in the case of Shares sold outside the United States, not a U.S. person in accordance with Regulation S of the Securities Act and (ii) was acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view to resell or distribute. We did not engage in general solicitation or advertising, and did not offer securities to the public, in connection with such issuances and sales. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, we intend to maintain a share repurchase program in which we intend to offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of our outstanding Shares (by number of shares) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. Our Board of Directors may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act. All Shares purchased pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under the share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase Shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase such Shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that Shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be subject to an early repurchase deduction of 2 of the aggregate NAV of the Shares repurchased (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date and does not include Shares received under our distribution reinvestment plan. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived by us in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by us for the benefit of our remaining stockholders.

On the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, from time to time from the Closing Date until the end of the Revolving Period, the Borrower (or the Servicer on behalf of the Borrower) may request that the Lenders make Advances (which shall include an interest-only notional advance in respect of which interest will accrue thereon at the I/O Rate) secured by the Collateral, in an aggregate amount up to the Availability as of such date, to the Borrower for any purpose not prohibited under Section 5.02(h); provided that, no Lender shall be obligated to make any Advance on or after the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the earlier to occur of the Commitment Termination Date or the Facility Maturity Date. Under no circumstances shall any Lender be required to make any Advance if after giving effect to such Advance and the addition to the Collateral of the Eligible Loan Assets being acquired by the Borrower using the proceeds of such Advance, (i) an Event of Default exists or would result therefrom or an Unmatured Event of Default exists or would result therefrom or (ii) a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists or would result therefrom. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Lender shall be obligated to provide the Borrower with aggregate funds in connection with an Advance that would exceed such Lender's unused Commitment then in effect. 
 (b)	 Promissory Note . Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note of the Borrower (in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) evidencing the (i) Advances of such Lender with appropriate insertions as to the date and principal amount or (ii) the I/O Loan of such Lender, with appropriate insertions as to the date and interest amount, not to exceed the I/O Notional Loan Amount allocable to such Lender. For the avoidance of doubt, any note delivered in connection with an I/O Loan shall be a zero principal balance note. 
 (c)	 I/O Notional Loans . For the purposes of calculating the accrued interest under the I/O Loan, the Borrower and Lenders hereby agree that on the Closing Date, a loan with a principal amount equal to the I/O Notional Loan Amount shall be deemed to have been advanced to the Borrower by the applicable Lenders under the I/O Loan (each such loan, an I/O Notional Loan ), and any increase or any decrease, if any, of the I/O Notional Loan Amount of the I/O Notional Loans shall be allocated ratably to those Lenders who are the holders of the I/O Loan, solely to the extent that the aggregate Commitments are increased or decreased. No amounts will actually be advanced by any Lender to the Borrower in respect of the I/O Notional Loan and no amount shall be owed by the Borrower to any Lender with respect to any such I/O Notional Loan (other than in respect of Yield at the I/O Rate). The amount of interest payable to a Lender in respect of the I/O Notional Loan shall be calculated with respect to such Lender's I/O Notional Loan Lender Percentage.

 (iii)	the Eligible Currency; 
 (iv)	a representation that all conditions precedent for an Advance described in Article III hereof shall have been satisfied as of such date or not later than the proposed date of such Advance;

Advance, for deposit by the Collateral Agent into the Principal Collection Subaccount or (y) an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Advance, for deposit by the Collateral Agent into the Unfunded Exposure Account, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, each Advance and related increase in the Advances Outstanding shall be allocated ratably to each Lender in accordance with their respective Lender's Pro Rata Share as in effect before such increase. Any Lender which fails to remit its Pro Rata Share in connection with any Advance in accordance with this Section 2.02 shall constitute a Defaulting Lender, and the Borrower shall have all rights available to the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19 . 
 (c)	Each Advance shall bear interest at the applicable Yield Rate. 
 (d)	Subject to Section 2.16 and the other terms, conditions, provisions and limitations set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, repay or prepay and reborrow Advances without any penalty, fee or premium on and after the Closing Date and prior to the end of the Revolving Period.

Following receipt of a Notice of Borrowing (which shall specify the account details of the Unfunded Exposure Account where the funds will be made available), each Lender shall fund its Pro Rata Share of such Unfunded Exposure Amount Shortfall in accordance with Section 2.02(b) , notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including, without limitation, the Borrower's failure to satisfy any of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.02 other than an Event of Default.

(iv)	If any Lender is not a United States Tax Person, such Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 
 (v)	Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.11(g) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
 (h)	Unless required by Applicable Law, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender, as the case may be. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes as to which it has been indemnified or paid Additional Amounts pursuant to this Section 2.11 , it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made or Additional Amounts paid under this Section 2.11 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 2.11(h) plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.11(h) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.11(h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or Additional Amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
 (i)	Each party's obligations under this Section 2.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Transaction Document. 
 (j)	If at any time the Borrower shall be liable for the payment of any Additional Amounts in accordance with this Section 2.11 , then the Borrower shall have the option to terminate this Agreement (in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.16(b) ); provided that such option 
 97 LEGAL_US_E # 178399887.17 

to terminate shall in no event relieve the Borrower of paying any amounts owing pursuant to this Section 2.11 in accordance with the terms hereof. 
 Section 2.12	 Grant of a Security Interest; Collateral Assignment of Agreements . 
 (a)	To secure the prompt, complete and indefeasible payment in full when due, whether by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise, of the Obligations and the performance by the Borrower of all of the covenants and obligations to be performed by it pursuant to this Agreement and each other Transaction Document, whether now or hereafter existing, due or to become due, direct or indirect, or absolute or contingent (collectively, the Secured Obligations ), the Borrower hereby (i) collaterally assigns and pledges to the Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties and (ii) Grants a security interest to the Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, in all of the Borrower's right, title and interest in, to and under (but none of the obligations under) all of the Collateral, whether now existing or hereafter arising or acquired by the Borrower, and wherever the same may be located. For the avoidance of doubt, the Collateral shall not include any Excluded Amounts, and the Borrower does not hereby assign, pledge or Grant a security interest in any such amounts. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (x) the Borrower shall remain liable under the Collateral to the extent set forth therein to perform all of its duties and obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (y) the exercise by the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, of any of its rights in the Collateral shall not release the Borrower from any of its duties or obligations under the Collateral, and (z) none of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lender nor any Secured Party shall have any obligations or liability under the Collateral by reason of this Agreement, nor shall the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lender nor any Secured Party be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of the Borrower thereunder or to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder. 
 The foregoing Grant shall, for the purpose of determining the property subject to the Lien of this Agreement, be deemed to include any securities and any investments Granted to the Collateral Agent by or on behalf of the Borrower, whether or not such securities or investments satisfy the criteria set forth in the definitions of Eligible Loan Asset or Permitted Investments, as the case may be. 
 (b)	As security for the Secured Obligations, the Borrower hereby collaterally assigns to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, all of the Borrower's right and title to and interest in, to and under (but not any obligations under) the Purchase and Sale Agreement (and any UCC financing statements filed under or in connection therewith), the Underlying Instruments related to each Loan Asset, all other agreements, documents and instruments evidencing, securing or guarantying any Loan Asset and all other agreements, documents and instruments related to any of the foregoing but excluding any Excluded Amounts or Retained Interest (the Assigned Documents ). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Borrower hereby collaterally assigns to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, its right to indemnification under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. The Borrower confirms that until the Collection Date the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Administrative Agent) on behalf of the Secured Parties shall have the sole right after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default to enforce the Borrower's rights and 
 98 LEGAL_US_E # 178399887.17 

remedies under the Purchase and Sale Agreement and any UCC financing statements filed under or in connection therewith for the benefit of the Secured Parties. 
 The parties hereto agree that such collateral assignment to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, shall terminate upon the Collection Date. 
 Section 2.13	 Evidence of Debt . The Administrative Agent shall maintain, solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, at its address referred to in Section 12.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance and participation agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses and interests of the Lenders (including principal amounts of and stated interest on the Advances or stated interest on the I/O Loan, as applicable) (the Register ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender under this Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time during business hours and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. No Advance or I/O Loan hereunder shall be assigned or sold, in whole or in part without registering such assignment or sale on the Register. Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, however, shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of any Advance and the I/O Loan. 
 Section 2.14	 Release of Loan Assets . 
 (a)	The Lien granted and created pursuant to this Agreement shall be automatically released with respect to the following: (a) any Loan Asset (and the Related Asset) sold or substituted in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.07 , (b) any Loan Asset (and the Related Asset) with respect to which all amounts have been paid in full by the related Obligor and deposited in the Collection Account and (c) the entire Collateral following the Collection Date. The Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, shall, at the sole expense of the Servicer and the Borrower and at the direction of the Administrative Agent, execute such documents and instruments of release as may be prepared by the Servicer on behalf of the Borrower, give notice of such release to the Collateral Custodian (in the form of Exhibit J (unless the Collateral Custodian and Collateral Agent are the same Person) and take other such actions as shall reasonably be requested by the Borrower to effect such release of the Lien created pursuant to this Agreement. Upon receiving such notification by the Collateral Agent as described in the immediately preceding sentence, if applicable, the Collateral Custodian shall deliver the Required Loan Documents to the Borrower. 
 (b)	Upon the occurrence of the Collection Date, the respective remaining interests in the Related Assets of each Lender, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent shall be automatically released to the Borrower, for no consideration but at the sole expense of the Borrower, free and clear of any Lien resulting solely from an act by any Lender, the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent but without any other representation or warranty, express or implied, by or recourse against any Lender, the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent, and the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent shall promptly provide evidence of any such release as the Borrower may request, at the sole expense of the Borrower. 
 99 LEGAL_US_E # 178399887.17 

(c)	The security interest on any Loan Assets released pursuant to this Section 2.14 or pursuant to Section 2.07 shall be automatically released upon the consummation of the transfer or distribution of such Loan Asset, without any further action from the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent; provided , however , the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent shall, upon the reasonable request of the Servicer or the Borrower, deliver any documentation or take any actions necessary or desirable to evidence the release of such security interest. 
 Section 2.15	 Treatment of Amounts Received by the Borrower . Amounts received by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.07 on account of Loan Assets shall be treated as payments of Principal Collections or Interest Collections, as applicable, on Loan Assets hereunder. 
 Section 2.16	 Prepayment; Termination; Reduction . 
 (a)	Except as expressly permitted or required herein, including, any repayment necessary to cure a Borrowing Base Deficiency, Advances Outstanding may only be prepaid in whole or in part at the option of the Borrower at any time by delivering a Notice of Reduction (which notice shall include a Borrowing Base Certificate) to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent at least one (1) Business Day, or in the case of any prepayment in whole, at least three (3) Business Days, prior to such prepayment. Upon any prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay in full all accrued and unpaid Yield, any Breakage Fees, Increased Costs and all accrued and unpaid costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and Lenders required to be paid pursuant to Section 12.07 related to such prepayment. The Administrative Agent shall apply amounts received from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.16(a) to the payment of any Breakage Fees and to the pro rata reduction of the Advances Outstanding. Each prepayment by the Borrower of an Advance denominated in an Eligible Currency shall be made with such Eligible Currency. Any notice relating to any repayment pursuant to this Section 2.16(a) shall be irrevocable; provided that any such notice may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other events, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such events fail to become effective (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall be liable for any Breakage Fees or, subject to Section 12.07 , other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with such revocation). 
 (b)	On any Business Day that is on or after one (1) year following the Closing Date (or, if Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. or any Affiliate thereof is no longer the Administrative Agent, any Business Day following the Closing Date), the Borrower may, at its option and upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice of such termination or permanent reduction in the form of Exhibit F to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, either (i) terminate this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents upon payment in full of all Advances Outstanding, all accrued and unpaid Yield and Fees, any Breakage Fees, Increased Costs, all accrued and unpaid costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and Lenders, and payment of all other Obligations (other than unmatured contingent indemnification obligations), or (ii) permanently reduce in part the Facility Amount upon payment in full, all accrued and unpaid Yield and Unused Fees pro rata with respect to the portion of the Facility Amount so reduced), any Breakage Fees, Increased Costs, and all accrued and unpaid costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and Lenders. Any Termination/Reduction Notice relating to any reduction 
 100 LEGAL_US_E # 178399887.17 

or termination pursuant to this Section 2.16(b) shall be irrevocable; provided that any such notice may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other events, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such events fail to become effective (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall be liable for any Breakage Fees or, subject to Section 12.07 , other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with such revocation). The Commitment and I/O Notional Loan Amount of each Lender shall be reduced by an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share (prior to giving effect to any reduction of Commitments hereunder) of the aggregate amount of any reduction under this Section 2.16(b) . 
 Section 2.17	 Collections and Allocations . 
 (a)	The Collateral Agent shall promptly identify all Available Collections received in the Collection Account as being on account of Interest Collections or Principal Collections and shall segregate all Interest Collections and Principal Collections and transfer the same to the Interest Collection Subaccount and the Principal Collection Subaccount, respectively. If the Servicer receives any collections directly, the Servicer shall transfer, or cause to be transferred, any such collections received directly by it (if any) to the Collection Account by the close of business within two (2) Business Days after such Interest Collections and Principal Collections are received; provided that the Servicer shall identify to the Collateral Agent any collections received directly by the Servicer as being on account of Interest Collections or Principal Collections. The Collateral Agent shall further provide to the Servicer a statement as to the amount of Interest Collections and Principal Collections on deposit in the Interest Collection Subaccount and the Principal Collection Subaccount no later than three (3) Business Days prior to each Determination Date for inclusion in the Servicing Report delivered pursuant to Section 6.08(b) . 
 (b)	Within two (2) Business Days of the Cut-Off Date with respect to any Loan Asset, the Servicer will deposit or will cause the Borrower to deposit into the Collection Account all Available Collections received in respect of Eligible Loan Assets being transferred to and included as part of the Collateral on such date. 
 (c)	The Servicer may withdraw from the Collection Account any deposits thereto constituting Excluded Amounts if the Servicer has, prior to such withdrawal, delivered to the Administrative Agent a report setting forth the calculation of such Excluded Amounts in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion. 
 (d)	Prior to the delivery of a Notice of Exclusive Control, the Servicer shall, pursuant to written instruction (which may be in the form of standing instructions), direct the Collateral Agent to invest, or cause the investment of, funds on deposit in the Controlled Accounts in Permitted Investments, from the date of this Agreement until the Collection Date. Absent any such written instruction, such funds shall be invested in the Standby Investment. A Permitted Investment acquired with funds deposited in any Controlled Account shall mature not later than the Business Day immediately preceding any Payment Date, and shall not be sold or disposed of prior to its maturity. All such Permitted Investments shall be registered in the name of the Account Bank or its nominee for the benefit of the Collateral Agent. All income and gain realized from any such investment, as well as any interest earned on deposits in any Controlled Account shall be 
 101 LEGAL_US_E # 178399887.17 

distributed in accordance with the provisions of Article II hereof. The Borrower shall deposit in the Collection Account or the Unfunded Exposure Account, as the case may be (with respect to investments made hereunder of funds held therein), an amount equal to the amount of any actual loss incurred, in respect of any such investment, immediately upon realization of such loss. None of the Account Bank, the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall be liable for the amount of any loss incurred, in respect of any investment, or lack of investment, of funds held in any Controlled Account, other than with respect to their own gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. The parties hereto acknowledge that the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, a Lender or any of their respective Affiliates may receive compensation with respect to the Permitted Investments. 
 (e)	Until the Collection Date, neither the Borrower nor the Servicer shall have any rights of direction or withdrawal, with respect to amounts held in any Controlled Account, except to the extent explicitly set forth in Section 2.04 , Section 2.17(c) or Section 2.18 . 
 Section 2.18	 Reinvestment of Principal Collections . 
 On the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth as certified in writing to the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent, prior to the end of the Revolving Period, the Servicer may, to the extent of any Principal Collections on deposit in the Principal Collection Subaccount: 
 (a)	direct the Collateral Agent to withdraw such funds for the purpose of reinvesting in additional Eligible Loan Assets to be Granted hereunder; provided that the following conditions are satisfied or waived in writing: 
 (i)	all conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.02 and Section 3.04 have been satisfied; 
 (ii)	no Event of Default has occurred, or would result from such withdrawal and reinvestment, and no Unmatured Event of Default or Borrowing Base Deficiency exists or would result from such withdrawal and reinvestment (other than any Unmatured Event of Default or Borrowing Base Deficiency which would be cured after giving effect to the use of such funds); 
 (iii)	the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.01 , 4.02 and 4.03 hereof shall continue to be correct in all material respects (or, in the case of any representation and warranty that is already qualified by materiality, in all respects), except to the extent relating to an earlier date; and 
 (iv)	delivery of a Disbursement Request and a Borrowing Base Certificate, each executed by the Borrower and a Responsible Officer of the Servicer; or 
 (b)	direct the Collateral Agent to withdraw such funds for the purpose of making payments in respect of the Advances Outstanding at such time in accordance with and subject to the terms of Section 2.16 . 
 102 LEGAL_US_E # 178399887.17 

Upon the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in this Section 2.18 (as certified by the Borrower to the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent), the Collateral Agent shall withdraw funds from the Principal Collection Subaccount as directed by the Servicer in an amount not to exceed the lesser of (x) the amount requested by the Servicer for reinvestment or repayment and (y) the amount on deposit in the Principal Collection Subaccount on such day. 
 Section 2.19	 Defaulting Lenders . 
 (a)	Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then: 
 (i)	 the portion of the Advance funded by such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder and the Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders have taken or may have taken any action hereunder; provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders or Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender, as applicable; 
 (ii)	any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, or otherwise), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Advance in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Advances under this Agreement; fourth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth , so long as no Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Advances in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Advances of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Advances of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Advances are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting 
 103 LEGAL_US_E # 178399887.17 

Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto; and; 
 (iii)	for any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Unused Fee for any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender). 
 (b)	In the event that the Administrative Agent, and, so long as no Event of Default exists, the Borrower determines (such determination not to be unreasonably withheld) that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender and the provisions of clause (a) above shall, from and after such determination, cease to be of further force or effect with respect to such Lender; provided that no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to a non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender having been a Defaulting Lender. 
 (c)	Replacement of a Lender. 
 (i)	If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender or requests compensation under Section 2.10 or Section 2.11 , then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon not less than five (5) Business Days advance notice to the Administrative Agent and (if different) the related Lender, (x) require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 12.04 ), all of its respective interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (A) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent with respect to any assignee that is not already a Lender hereunder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (B) the assignee shall not be an Affiliate of any of the Borrower, the Servicer or the Transferor, (C) such assigning Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to all outstanding Advances funded or maintained by such Lender, together with all accrued interest thereon and all accrued Fees, and (D) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have agreed to, and shall be sufficient (together with all other consenting Lenders) to cause the adoption of, the applicable consent, waiver or amendment of the Transaction Documents or (y) terminate the Commitment of such Lender and repay all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Lender relating to the portion of the Advance held by such Lender as of such termination date, without the payment of any penalty, fee or premium. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to exist. 
 104 LEGAL_US_E # 178399887.17 

(ii)	Any Lender being replaced pursuant to Section 2.19(c)(i) above shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such Lender's applicable Commitment and outstanding portion of the Advance funded by such Lender. Pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, (A) the assignee Lender shall acquire all or a portion, as the case may be, of the assigning Lender's Commitment and outstanding portion of the Advance and (B) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the assigning Lender relating to the Advance and Commitments so assigned shall be paid in full by the assignee Lender to such assigning Lender concurrently with such Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and under each of the Transaction Documents and the assigning Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to such assigned portion of the Advance and Commitments, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such assigning Lender. In connection with any such replacement, if any such Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly executed Assignment and Acceptance reflecting such replacement within three (3) Business Days of the date on which the assignee Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Acceptance to such Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender, then such Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance without any action on the part of the Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender. 
 (d)	In the event that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent has requested any consent, waiver or amendment by any Lender or the Lenders to any matter pursuant to this Agreement, and such consent, waiver or amendment in question requires the agreement of all affected Lenders, the Lenders or the Required Lenders, then any Lender who does not agree to such consent, waiver or amendment within five (5) Business Days' written notice to such Lender that such amendment has been agreed to by the Required Lenders shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Lender. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) Non-Consenting Lender shall not include any Lender that abstains from voting on any consent, waiver or amendment if the vote of such Lender would not be required in order for such consent, waiver or amendment to be approved pursuant to this Agreement, and (y) if the Administrative Agent is also a Lender, any failure of the Administrative Agent, acting in its capacity as Administrative Agent, to grant any consent, waiver or amendment shall not result in the Administrative Agent, acting in its capacity as a Lender, being deemed to be a Non-Consenting Lender. In the event that the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity is a Non-Consenting Lender and the Borrower has replaced the Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.19 , then the Borrower shall have the right to remove and replace the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 9.01(h) . 
 Section 2.20	 Benchmark Replacement Setting . 
 (a)	 Benchmark Replacement (Dollar) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, if (A) a Benchmark Transition Event and (B) a Benchmark Replacement Date with respect thereto have occurred prior to the Reference Time in connection with any setting of the then-current Benchmark (Dollar), then such Benchmark Replacement (Dollar) will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes under this 
 105 LEGAL_US_E # 178399887.17 

Agreement and under any other Transaction Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without requiring any amendment to, or requiring any further action by or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 
 (b)	 Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes . In connection with the implementation or administration of Term SOFR or a Benchmark Replacement (Dollar), the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without requiring any further action by or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 
 (c)	 Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations . The Administrative Agent will promptly notify all the parties hereto in writing in advance (if feasible) of (i) any occurrence of (A) a Benchmark Transition Event and (B) the Benchmark Replacement Date with respect thereto, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement (Dollar), and (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. 
 (d)	 Benchmark Replacement (Non-Dollar) . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if at any time the Administrative Agent determines that a Benchmark Transition Event has arisen with respect to any Benchmark other than the Benchmark (Dollar) or Term CORRA, then the Administrative Agent may designate a new benchmark rate (which may include spread adjustments applicable to such rate or any rate based on such rate) to be used to calculate such Benchmark, which benchmark rate may be (i) a comparable successor rate that, at such time, is broadly accepted by the U.S. syndicated loan market for loans denominated in the applicable currency (as applicable) in lieu of the then-applicable Benchmark for such currency or (ii) such other benchmark rate designated by the Administrative Agent. Except as set forth in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the designation of such alternative benchmark rate shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement. If (x) the circumstances described in clause (i) or clause (ii) above have arisen and (y) the Benchmark for such currency cannot be determined for such Remittance Period in accordance with the definition of the applicable Benchmark, then until an alternate benchmark rate shall be determined in accordance with this clause (d) , for any Advance denominated in such currency, the Benchmark shall be equal to the benchmark for the Administrative Agent's cost of funds in such currency (as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent by written notice to the Borrower). 
 Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.20 , including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in the Administrative Agent's sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 
 (e)	 Canadian Benchmark Replacement Setting . 
 106 LEGAL_US_E # 178399887.17 

(i)	Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, if (A) a Canadian Benchmark Transition Event and (B) a Canadian Benchmark Replacement Date with respect thereto have occurred prior to any setting of the then-current Canadian Benchmark, then such Canadian Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Canadian Benchmark for all purposes under this Agreement and under any other Transaction Document in respect of such Canadian Benchmark setting and subsequent Canadian Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or requiring any further action by or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 
 (ii)	Canadian Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the implementation or administration of Term CORRA or a Canadian Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Canadian Benchmark Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Transaction Document, any amendments implementing such Canadian Benchmark Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 
 (iii)	Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify all the parties hereto in writing in advance (if feasible) of (i) any occurrence of (A) a Canadian Benchmark Transition Event and (B) the Canadian Benchmark Replacement Date with respect thereto, (ii) the implementation of any Canadian Benchmark Replacement, and (iii) the effectiveness of any Canadian Benchmark Conforming Changes. 
 Section 2.21	 Currency Disruption Events; Inability to Determine Rates . 
 (a)	Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, in the event of a Currency Disruption Event, the affected Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Borrower thereof, and such Lender's obligation to make or maintain Advances hereunder based on Term SOFR, BBSY Rate, Adjusted Term CORRA, EURIBOR, Daily Simple SONIA or any successor rate, as applicable, shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain Advances based on Term SOFR, BBSY Rate, Adjusted Term CORRA, EURIBOR, Daily Simple SONIA or any successor rate, as applicable. 
 (b)	Upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to a Lender's suspending its obligation to make or maintain Advances based on Term SOFR, BBSY Rate, Adjusted Term CORRA, EURIBOR, Daily Simple SONIA or any successor rate, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.21(a) , such Lender will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate a different lending office if such designation would enable such Lender to again make or maintain Advances based on Term SOFR, BBSY Rate, Adjusted Term CORRA, EURIBOR, Daily Simple SONIA or any successor rate, as applicable; provided that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no unreimbursed cost or legal or regulatory disadvantage (as reasonably determined by such 
 107 LEGAL_US_E # 178399887.17 

Lender), with the object of avoiding future consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of any such provision.

 Section 2.22	 Eligible Currency . 
 (a)	Subject to the Pari Passu Provisions, any and all payments made by the Borrower under the Transaction Documents shall be made in the applicable Eligible Currency; provided that: (i) repayment of Advances in an Eligible Currency other than Dollars shall be made in the corresponding Eligible Currency. Each party hereto agrees that the Available Collections and all such other amounts described in Section 2.04(a) shall be applied in accordance with the priority of payments set forth in Section 2.04(a) . The Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby instruct the Collateral Agent to apply the Available Collections and all such other amounts described in Section 2.04(a) in accordance with Section 2.04(a) ; provided that such payments shall be subject to availability of such funds pursuant to Section 2.04(a) . 
 (b)	The Servicer shall instruct the Account Bank, on the Determination Date immediately preceding each Payment Date, to convert amounts on deposit in the Collection Account into each Eligible Currency to the extent necessary to make payments pursuant to Section 2.04(a) , as applicable (as determined by the Servicer using the Spot Rate).

 (e)	The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that: 
 (i)	the Account Bank may rely conclusively on the bases for the prevailing market rate and shall not be held liable for any associated losses (including without limitation any losses incurred on account of the difference between an indicative market rate quoted by the Account Bank and the actual market rate prevailing in respect of an executed trade); and 
 (ii)	the Account Bank may receive any fees and spread on foreign exchange transactions customarily charged by the Account Bank in connection with any foreign exchange transaction(s) settled pursuant to this Agreement solely to the extent of Administrative Expenses payable to it pursuant to Section 2.04 . 
 (f)	The Account Bank may convert currency itself or through any of its Affiliates and, in those cases, the Account Bank or, as the case may be, its Affiliate through which currency is converted, acts as principal for its own account and not as agent, advisor, broker or fiduciary on behalf of any other person and earns revenue, including, without limitation, transaction spreads, sales margin, that it will retain for its own account. The revenue is based on, among other things, the difference between the exchange rate assigned to the currency conversion made under this Agreement and the rate that the Account Bank or any of its Affiliate receives when buying or selling foreign currency for its own account. The Account Bank makes no representation that the exchange rate used or obtained in any currency conversion under this Agreement will be the most favorable rate that could be obtained at the time or as to the method by which that rate will be determined. 
 (g)	The foreign exchange transaction may be transmitted by the Account Bank to a sub-custodian or depositary.

If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.10 , or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.11 then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loan Assets hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10 or Section 2.11 , as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

 (a)	On any Business Day, the Borrower shall have the right to prepay all or a portion of the Advances then outstanding and require the Collateral Agent to release its security interest and Lien on the related Loan Assets and Related Assets transferred in connection with a

 Section 12.03	 No Waiver; Remedies . No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. 
 Section 12.04	 Binding Effect; Assignability; Multiple Lenders . 
 (a)	This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Servicer, the Administrative Agent, each Lender, the Collateral Agent, the Account Bank, the Collateral Custodian and their respective successors and permitted assigns. With the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (unless such assignment is to an Affiliate of a Lender or is otherwise required by Applicable Law), each Lender and their respective successors and assigns may assign, grant a security interest or sell a participation interest in, (i) this Agreement and such Lender's rights and obligations hereunder and interest herein in whole or in part (including by way of the sale of participation interests therein) and/or (ii) any Advance or the I/O Loan (or portion thereof) to any Person; provided that, so long as no Event of Default has occurred, the Borrower shall be required to provide its written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed with respect to an assignee that is not a Disqualified Institution) to such assignment to any Person that is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender (but, for the avoidance of doubt, no such consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment of the I/O Loan (or portion thereof), any grant of a security interest or sale of a participation interest to any Person or an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender). Notwithstanding the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment under this Section 12.04(a) to a Disqualified Institution following the occurrence of an Event of Default unless such assignment occurs while such Event of Default is continuing and after such Event of Default has been continuing for a period of at least three (3) months. Any such assignee shall execute and deliver to the Servicer, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a fully-executed assignment and acceptance agreement in the form of Exhibit K hereto (an Assignment and Acceptance ). The parties to any such assignment, grant or sale of a participation interest shall execute and deliver to the related Lender for its acceptance and recording in its books and records, such agreement or document as may be satisfactory to such parties and the applicable Lender. None of the Borrower, the Transferor or the Servicer may assign, or permit any Lien to exist upon, any of its rights or obligations hereunder or under any Transaction Document or any interest herein or in any Transaction Document without the prior written consent of each Lender and the Administrative Agent. 
 191 LEGAL_US_E # 178399887.17

 (c)	Each Affected Party and each Indemnified Party shall be an express third party beneficiary of this Agreement. 
 (d)	Upon the effectiveness of any assignment by any Lender of all or any of its rights and obligations under the Transaction Documents, any Advance and/or the I/O Loan pursuant to Section 12.04(a) and the delivery to the Administrative Agent of all assignment documentation and the Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall revise Annex A to reflect such assignment. 
 (e)	Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant's interest in the Advances or other obligations under the Transaction Documents (the Participant Register provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Transaction Document) to any person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations and Section 1.163-5(b) of the proposed United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
 (f)	In the event any Lender sells a participation in this Agreement or any Advance, the Borrower agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10 and 2.11 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.11(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.11(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to this Section 12.04 ; provided that such participant (i) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.19(c) as if it were an assignee under this Section 12.04 ; and (ii) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.10 or 2.11 , with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the participant acquired the applicable participation.

 Section 12.11	 Characterization of Conveyances Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement . 
 (a)	It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the conveyance of the Eligible Loan Assets by the Transferor to the Borrower as contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement be, and be treated for all purposes as, a sale by the Transferor of such Eligible Loan Assets. It is, further, not the intention of the parties that such conveyance be deemed a pledge of the Eligible Loan Assets by the Transferor to the Borrower to secure a debt or other obligation of the Transferor. However, in the event that, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, the Eligible Loan Assets are held to continue to be property of the Transferor, then the parties hereto agree that: (i) the Purchase and Sale Agreement shall also be deemed to be a security agreement under Applicable Law; (ii) as set forth in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the transfer of the Eligible Loan Assets provided for in the Purchase and Sale Agreement shall be deemed to be a grant by the Transferor to the Borrower of a first priority security interest (subject only to Permitted Liens) in all of the Transferor's right, title and interest in and to the Eligible Loan Assets and all amounts payable to the holders of the Eligible Loan Assets in accordance with the terms thereof and all proceeds of the conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing into cash, instruments, securities or other property, including, all amounts from time to time held or invested in the Controlled Accounts, whether in the form of cash, instruments, securities or other property; (iii) the possession by the Borrower (or the Collateral Custodian on its behalf) of Loan Assets and such other items of property as constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be, subject to clause (iv) below, for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the UCC; and (iv) acknowledgements from Persons holding such property shall be deemed acknowledgements from custodians, bailees or agents (as applicable) of the Borrower for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under Applicable Law. The parties further agree that any assignment of the interest of the Borrower pursuant to any provision hereof shall also be deemed to be an assignment of any security interest created pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. The Borrower shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if the Purchase and Sale Agreement was deemed to create a security interest in the Eligible Loan Assets, such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected security interest of first priority (subject only to Permitted Liens) under Applicable Law and will be maintained as such throughout the term of this Agreement. 
 (b)	It is the intention of each of the parties hereto that the Eligible Loan Assets conveyed by the Transferor to the Borrower pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement shall constitute assets owned by the Borrower and shall not be part of the Transferor's estate in the event of the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against the Transferor under any bankruptcy or similar law. 
 (c)	The Borrower agrees to treat, and shall cause the Transferor to treat, for all purposes other than for U.S. federal and state income tax, the transactions effected by the Purchase and Sale Agreement as sales of assets to the Borrower.
