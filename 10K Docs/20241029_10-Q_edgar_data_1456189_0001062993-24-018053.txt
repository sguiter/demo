of total revenues, is recorded as the underlying product sales occur, in accordance with the related licensing arrangements. 
 The Company's standard distributor payment terms range from pre-payment in full to 60 days after shipment and subsequent sales of product by distributors have no effect on the amount and timing of payments due to the Company, however, in limited instances qualified distributors and dealers may be granted extended payment terms during selected order periods. In performing such evaluations, the Company utilizes historical experience, sales performance, and credit risk requirements. Furthermore, products purchased by distributors may not be returned to the Company in the event that any such distributor relationship is terminated. 
 Since the Company (through its wholly-owned subsidiary) serves as the distributor of Leatt products in the United States, the Company records its revenue and related cost of revenue for its product sales in the United States upon shipment of the merchandise to the dealer or to the ultimate consumer when there is no dealer in the geographic area or the consumer chooses to purchase directly from the Company's e-commerce website and the sales order was received directly from, and paid by, the ultimate consumer. Since the Company (through its South African branch) serves as the distributor of Leatt products in South Africa, the Company records its revenue and related cost of revenue for its product sales in South Africa upon shipment of the merchandise from the branch to the dealer. The Company's standard terms and conditions of sale for non-consumer direct or web-based sales do not allow for product returns other than under warranty. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 sales totalling and were deferred, respectively, as all of the requirements to have a complete contract with certain customers in accordance with ASC 606 had not been met at such respective date. The shipped goods associated with these deferred sales are included in the caption deferred asset in the balance sheet, net of an allowance for potential loss amounting to and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. 

International sales (other than in the United States and South Africa) are generally drop-shipped directly from the Company's consolidation warehouse or the third-party manufacturer to the international distributors. Revenue and related cost of revenue is recognized at the time of shipment from the manufacturer's port when the shipping terms are Free On Board ("FOB") shipping point, Cost and Freight ("CFR") or Cost and Insurance to named place ("CIP") as legal title and risk of loss to the product pass to the distributor. Sales to all customers (distributors, dealers and consumers) are generally final; however, in limited instances, product may be returned and exchanged due to product quality issues. Historically, returns due to product quality issues have not been material and there have been no distributor terminations that resulted in product returns. Cost of revenues also includes royalty fees associated with sales of Leatt-Brace products. Product royalty income is recorded as the underlying product sales occur, in accordance with the related licensing arrangements. 
 In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by the source of revenue: 

Dealer direct revenues 

International distributor revenues 

The Company reviews the reserves for customer returns at each reporting period and adjusts them to reflect data available at that time. To estimate reserves for returns, the Company estimates the expected returns and claims based on historical rates as well as events and circumstances that indicate changes to historical rates of product returns and claims. Historically, returns due to product quality issues have not been material and there have been no distributor terminations that resulted in product returns. The provision for estimated returns at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was , and , respectively. 
 Accounts receivable consist of amounts due to the Company from normal business activities. Credit is granted to substantially all distributors on an unsecured basis. The Company continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon the expected credit losses determined utilizing historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified. In determining the amount of the allowance, the Company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions. Accounts receivable balances that are still outstanding after the Company used reasonable collection efforts are written off as uncollectible. While such credit losses have historically been minimal, within the Company's expectations and the provisions established, the Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of the Company's significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectability of the Company's accounts receivable and future operating results. The allowance for short-term doubtful accounts at September 30, 2024 was and at December 31, 2023 was . Additionally, an allowance for long-term doubtful accounts will be included for accounts receivables that are anticipated to be collected over a period that is greater than 12 months. The allowance for long-term doubtful accounts at September 30, 2024 was and at December 31, 2023 was . 
 Sales commissions are expensed when incurred, which is generally at the time of sale, because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in commissions and consulting expenses within operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 Shipping and handling activities associated with outbound freight, after control over a product has transferred to a customer, are accounted for as a fulfilment cost and are included in revenues and cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Revenue recognized from contracts with customers is recorded net of sales taxes, value added taxes, or similar taxes that are collected on behalf of local taxing authorities.

potential common shares, consisting of preferred shares, and options to purchase shares, outstanding that were dilutive. 

. As of September 30, 2024, there was of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock. 

The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on global shipping and supply chains which caused a disruption in our customers' ordering patterns and ultimately inflated certain industry wide stock levels. This was further compounded by the global economic slowdown experienced worldwide due to a high inflationary environment and geo-political instability. Although global conditions continue to improve, elevated industry wide inventory levels and adverse economic conditions compounded by resultant foreign exchange rate volatility may continue to impact levels of dealer and distributor ordering and ultimately consumer spending in the foreseeable future, which may affect the Company's profitability, and could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations for the coming periods and beyond.

Overview of Our Business 
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 11, 2005, under the name Treadzone, Inc. We were a shell company with little or no operations until March 1, 2006, when we acquired the exclusive global manufacturing, distribution, sale and use rights to the Leatt-Brace , pursuant to a license agreement between the Company and Xceed Holdings, a company controlled by the Company's Chairman and founder, Dr. Christopher Leatt. On May 25, 2005, we changed our name to Leatt Corporation in connection with our anticipated acquisition of the Leatt-Brace rights. Leatt designs, develops, markets and distributes personal protective equipment for participants in all forms of motor sports and leisure activities, including riders of motorcycles, bicycles, snowmobiles and ATVs. The Company sells its products to customers worldwide through a global network of distributors and retailers. Leatt also acts as the original equipment manufacturer for personal protective equipment sold by other international brands. 
 The Company's flagship products are based on the Leatt-Brace system, a patented injection molded neck protection system owned by Xceed Holdings, designed to prevent potentially devastating injuries to the cervical spine and neck. The Company has the exclusive global manufacturing, distribution, sale and use rights to the Leatt-Brace , pursuant to a license agreement between the Company and Xceed Holdings, a company owned and controlled by the Company's Chairman and founder, Dr. Christopher Leatt. The Company also has the right to use apparatus embodying, employing and containing the Leatt-Brace technology and has designed, developed, marketed and distributed other personal protective equipment using this technology, as well as its own developed technology, including the Company's body protection products, and helmets which it markets under the Leatt brand. 
 The Company's research and development efforts are conducted at its research facilities, located at its executive headquarters in Cape Town, South Africa. The Company employs 4 full-time employees who are dedicated exclusively to research, development, and testing. The Company also utilizes consultants, academic institutions and engineering companies as independent contractors or consultants, from time to time, to assist it with its research and development efforts. Leatt products have been tested and reviewed internally and by external bodies. All Leatt products are compliant with applicable European Union directives, or CE certified, where appropriate. Depending on the market we have other certifications outside of CE. Specifically, all our motorcycle helmets comply with Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) UN Regulation No. 22 r06, and our bicycle helmet complies with the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) EN-1078 standard. For the US market, our motorcycle helmets comply with the US Department of Transportation (DOT) FMVSS 218 helmet safety standard and our bicycle helmet complies with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) 1203 standard for helmet safety. Our downhill specific bicycle helmets also comply with the American Society for Testing and Materials ASTM) F1952 standard for downhill racing safety. For the Australian market, our bicycle helmet complies with Australian/New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS) 2063, for the UK market, substantially all of our motorcycle helmets comply with the Auto Cycle Union (ACU) gold standard, for the Japanese market, our Moto 3.5 helmet with the Japanese Standard Association (JSA) JIS T 8133 standard for protective helmets, and for the Brazilian market our Moto 7.5, Moto 3.5, Moto 2.5, ADV 9.5 and ADV 8.5 helmets comply with The Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (ABNT) NBR 7471 safety standard. Our Enduro 4.0 helmet and All-Mountain 4.0 helmet have acquired NTA8776 certification, a new e-bike helmet certification required in the Dutch Technical Agreement (NTA) 8776. 
 Our products are predominately manufactured in China in accordance with our manufacturing specifications, pursuant to outsourced manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers located there, based on agreed terms. We continue to build manufacturing capacity outside China, namely, in Thailand and Bangladesh. The Company utilizes outside consultants and its own employees to ensure the quality of its products through regular on-site product inspections. Products sold to our international customers are usually shipped directly from our consolidation warehouse or manufacturers' warehouses to customers or their import agents. 
 Leatt earns revenues through the sale of its products through approximately 49 distributors worldwide, who in turn sell its products to retailers. Leatt distributors are required to follow certain standard business terms and guidelines for the sale and distribution of Leatt products. Two Eleven and Leatt SA directly distribute Leatt products to dealers and direct to end consumers through digital channels in the United States and South Africa, respectively. 
 Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance 
 We believe that the following factors will continue to affect our financial performance: 
 
 Global Economic Fragility - The ongoing turmoil in the global economy, especially in the U.S., Asia and Europe, may have an impact on our business and our financial condition if economic conditions do not improve. We sell our products through a global network of distributors and dealers who may have difficulty clearing elevated multi-brand stock, previously ordered in response to industry-wide supply chain challenges, which in turn could slow new orders and affect our financial performance. If our customers were to experience prolonged slow growth or recession as a result of these conditions or otherwise, we could see a drop-in demand for our products and potentially difficulty in collecting accounts receivables. 

14 

Trade Restrictions - We engage in international manufacturing and sales which exposes us to trade restrictions and disruptions that could harm our business and competitive position. Most of our products are manufactured in China, and the U.S. administration has announced tariffs on certain products imported into the United States with China as the country of origin. While these tariffs have not had a significant impact on the shipment of our products to international markets as at September 30, 2024, we believe that the future imposition of, or significant increases in, the level of tariffs, custom duties, export quotas and other barriers and restrictions by the U.S. on China or other countries could disrupt our supply chain, increase the cost of our raw materials and therefore our pricing, and impose the burdens of compliance with foreign trade laws, any of which could potentially affect our bottom line and sales. While we are in continuous discussions with our manufacturers to ensure there are contingencies in place, we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by changes in the trade laws of foreign jurisdictions where we sell and seek to sell our products. 

Fuel Prices - Significant fluctuations in fuel prices could have both a positive and negative effect on our business and operations. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sales and significant fluctuations in world fuel prices could significantly increase the price of shipping or transporting our products which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. On the other hand, fluctuations in fuel prices lead to higher commuter costs which may encourage the increased use of motorcycles and bicycles as alternative modes of transportation and lead to an increase in the market for our protection products. 

Product Liability Litigation - We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims arising from the claimed failure of our products to help prevent the types of personal injury or death against which they are designed to help protect. Therefore, we have acquired very costly product liability insurance worldwide. We have not experienced any material uninsured losses due to product liability claims, but it is possible that we could experience material losses in the future. After a two-week trial in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (Eastern) ending on April 17, 2014, a federal jury returned a defense verdict for the Company in the first Leatt-Brace product liability lawsuit to be tried in the United States. The plaintiffs in that case had alleged that defective product design and failure to warn had caused a motocross rider to suffer multiple mid-thoracic spine fractures, causing immediate and permanent paraplegia, when he crashed at a relatively low speed on February 13, 2011. When the accident occurred, he was wearing a helmet and other safety gear from several different companies, including the Company's acclaimed Leatt-Brace . The Company produced evidence at trial showing that his thoracic paraplegia was an unavoidable consequence of his fall, not the result of wearing a Leatt-Brace , and that the neck brace likely saved his life (or saved him from quadriplegia) by preventing cervical spine injury. The Company had maintained from the onset that this and a small handful of other lawsuits are without merit and that it would vigorously defend itself in each case. In this case, the plaintiffs subsequently appealed the court's decision, and the parties reached an amicable settlement. Although we carry product liability insurance, a successful claim brought against us could significantly harm our business and financial condition and have an adverse impact on our ability to renew our product liability insurance or secure new coverage. 

Protection of Intellectual Property - We believe that the continued success of our business is dependent on our intellectual property portfolio consisting of globally registered trademarks, design patents and utility patents related to the Leatt-Brace . We believe that a loss of these rights would harm or cause a material disruption to our business and, our corporate strategy is to aggressively take legal action against any violators of our intellectual property rights, regardless of where they may be. From time to time, we have had to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation, and we may be required to do so in the future. Such litigation may result in substantial costs and could divert resources and management attention from the operations of our business. 

Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies - We are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and consolidated results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency as we translate these currencies into U.S. dollars when we consolidate our financial results. While our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, a portion of our consolidated revenues are denominated in South African Rand, or ZAR, certain of our assets are denominated in ZAR, and our research and marketing operations in South Africa utilize South African labor sources. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the ZAR could increase our cost of doing business in South Africa. If the ZAR depreciates against the U.S. Dollar, the value of our ZAR revenues, earnings and assets as expressed in our U.S. Dollar financial statements will decline. We have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk. Furthermore, since 66 of our sales are derived outside the U.S., where the U.S. dollar is not the primary currency, significant fluctuations in exchange rates such as the strengthening of the dollar versus our customers' local currency can adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in those areas. 

Natural or Man-made Catastrophic Events - We are exposed to natural or man-made catastrophic events that may disrupt our business and may reduce consumer demand for our products. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a natural disaster, health pandemic, such as the outbreak and global spread of COVID-19 or the coronavirus, or a man-made catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, continuing production, or performing other critical functions of our business, particularly if a catastrophic event occurred at our primary manufacturing locations or our distributor locations worldwide. Any of these events could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results could be adversely affected. There may also be secondary impacts that are unforeseeable, such as impacts on our consumers and on consumer purchasing behavior, which could cause delays in new orders, delays in completing sales or even order cancellations. The continued mutation and spread of deadly viruses, economic headwinds caused by global quarantines, or the occurrence of any other catastrophic events, could have a negative impact on our sales revenue for the coming period and beyond. 

15 

Impact of Global Conflict - We are exposed to global conflict, such as the ones in Ukraine and the Middle East, that may disrupt our business and reduce consumer demand for our products. A disruption of global shipping routes, the imposition of government sanctions or other activities resulting from such conflicts could directly affect consumer demand for our products, cause delays in completing sales, shipping of our products, continuing production or performing other critical functions of our business, particularly if a conflict occurs at our primary manufacturing locations or our distributor locations worldwide. Furthermore, prolonged conflict may have unintended global consequences such as increased inflation, fuel and transportation costs. While we have conducted due diligence on our customers in Russia to ensure that they do not fall into any sanctioned categories, we have seen a delay in the receipt of receivables in our bank account from the distributors of our products in Russia caused by enhanced screening of Russian funds in compliance with global sanctions against Russia for the war in Ukraine. The prolonging or expansion of that conflict could have an adverse impact on our consumers and on consumer purchasing behavior, and result in delays of new orders and completing sales, order cancellations, or payment and shipping delays. We will continue to monitor this fluid situation and any adverse impact that it may have on the global economy in general and on our business operations and especially that of our customers, and we will develop contingencies as necessary to address any disruptions to our business operations as they arise.

Revenues - We earn revenues from the sale of our protective gear comprising of neck braces, body armor, helmets and other products, parts and accessories both in the United States and abroad. Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were 12.14 million, a 1 increase, compared to 12.01 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This increase in worldwide revenues is primarily attributable to a 0.27 million increase in body armor sales, a 0.14 million increase in helmet sales, a 0.04 million increase in neck brace sales, that were partially offset by a 0.32 million decrease in other products, part and accessory sales. Revenues associated with international customers were 8.58 million and 8.16 million, or 71 and 68 of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenues generated from sales to our customers in the United States decreased from 3.85 million, to 3.55 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Although, consumer direct sales increased by 12 and sales to our global distributors increased by 5 , when compared to the third quarter of 2023, dealer direct sales decreased by 9 for the third quarter of 2024, as our MOTO dealers in the United States continue to conservatively manage specific category ordering as inventory continues to clear.

Sales of our flagship neck brace accounted for 0.75 million and 0.71 million, or 6 and 6 of our revenues for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 6 increase in neck brace revenues is primarily attributable to a 109 increase in the volume of our premium 6.5 neck brace, that was partially offset by a 37 decrease in the volume of 3.5 neck braces sold during the third quarter of 2024, when compared to the prior year three month period. 
 Our body armor products are comprised of chest protectors, full upper body protectors, upper body protection vests, back protectors, knee braces, knee and elbow guards, off-road motorcycle boots and mountain biking shoes. Body armor sales accounted for 5.73 million and 5.46 million, or 47 and 45 of our revenues for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 5 increase in body armor revenues was primarily the result of a 25 increase in revenues generated on the sale of upper body and limb protection during the third quarter of 2024, that was partially offset by a 55 decrease in the volume of footwear, comprising of motorcycle boots and mountain biking shoes, sold during the 2024 period, as our distribution partners continued to digest inventory. 
 Our helmet sales accounted for 3.01 million or 25 of our revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.87 million or 24 of our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 5 increase in helmet sales is primarily due to a 98 increase in revenues generated on the sale of MOTO helmets during the third quarter of 2024 that was partially offset by a 23 decrease in the volume of MTB helmets sold during the same period. 
 Our other products, parts and accessories are comprised of goggles, hydration bags and apparel items including jerseys, pants, shorts and jackets as well as aftermarket support items required primarily to replace worn or damaged parts through our global distribution network. Other products, parts and accessories sales accounted for 2.65 million and 2.97 million, or 22 and 25 of our revenues for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 11 decrease in revenues from the sale of other products, parts and accessories during the 2024 third quarter is primarily due to a 37 decrease in the volume of MTB apparel sold during the third quarter of 2024, as our MTB distribution partners continue to manage ordering as a result of stocking dynamics. 
 Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit - Cost of revenues for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 6.97 million and 6.89 million, respectively. Gross Profit for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 5.17 million and 5.12 million, respectively, or 43 and 43 of revenues, respectively. Ourneck braceproducts continue to generate a higher gross profit margin than our other product categories. Neck brace revenues were 6 and 6 of our revenues for the period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Product Royalty Income - Product royalty income is earned on sales to distributors that have royalty agreements in place, as well as on sales of licensed products by third parties that have licensing agreements in place. Product royalty income for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 123,706 and 1,767, respectively. The 6901 increase in product royalty income is due to an increase in the sale of licensed products to licensees during the 2024 period. 
 Salaries and Wages - Salaries and wages for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1,676,828 and 1,267,455, respectively. The 32 increase in salaries and wages during the 2024 period was primarily due to to the employment of professional sales, marketing and brand management personnel in the United States and abroad, as the Company continues to build and invest in global multi-channel distribution. 
 
 18 

Commissions and Consulting Expense - During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, commissions and consulting expenses were 138,124 and 168,299, respectively. The 18 decrease in commissions and consulting expenses is primarily the result of a decrease in commissions paid in the United States in line with the Company's employment of in-house sales representatives that are focused on selling the Company's growing range of product categories. 
 Professional Fees - Professional fees consist of costs incurred for audit, tax and regulatory filings, as well as patent protection and product liability litigation expenses incurred as the Company continues to expand. Professional fees for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 108,627 and 156,868, respectively. The 31 decrease in professional fees is primarily due to a decrease in expenditure on patent litigation and maintenance expenditure during the 2024 period. 
 Advertising and Marketing - The Company places paid advertising in various motorsport and bicycle magazines and online media and sponsors a number of events, professional teams and individuals to increase product and brand visibility globally. Advertising and marketing expenses for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1,304,215 and 974,488, respectively. The 34 increase in advertising and marketing expenditure during the 2024 period is primarily due to continued strong investment in the production and implementation of marketing campaigns that included athlete and event sponsorships, and activations designed to promote the Company's expanding product categories to a wider rider audience, that now includes adventure riders, globally. Additionally, the Company invested in high level strategic creative direction and brand building activities. 
 Office Lease and Expenses - Office lease and expenses for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 141,420 and 145,863, respectively. The 3 decrease in office lease and expenses during the 2024 period is primarily attributable to a decrease in office lease rental expenditures due to the purchase of the Company's head office facility in Cape Town, South Africa. 
 Research and Development Costs - These costs consist of the salaries of personnel who are directly involved in the research and development of innovative products, as well as the direct costs associated with developing these products. Research and development costs for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased to 620,019, from 610,589 during the same 2023 quarter. The 2 increase in research and development costs during the 2024 third quarter is primarily due an increase in certification costs incurred as the Company continues to develop and refine its product categories. 
 Bad Debt Expense (Recovery) - Bad debt expense (recovery) for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (30,788) and 46,113, respectively. The 167 decrease in bad debt expense (recovery) is primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable balances that were considered to be unrecoverable during the 2024 period when compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses - General and administrative expenses consist of insurance, travel, merchant fees, telephone, office and computer supplies. General and administrative expenses for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 993,031 and 830,145, respectively. The 20 increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to an increase in travel expenditure relating to product development and domestic selling activities and an increase in merchant fees associated with an increase in consumer direct sales, as the Company continues to intensify its online presence. 
 Depreciation Expense - Depreciation expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 316,404 and 299,554, respectively. The 6 increase in depreciation during the 2024 third quarter is primarily due to software enhancements utilized to improve consumer engagement and buying activity across the Company's web-based selling platforms. 
 Total Operating Expenses - Total operating expenses increased by 768,506, to 5.27 million, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, or 17 , compared to 4.50 million in the 2023 period. This increase in total operating expenses during the 2024 period is primarily due to increases in salaries, general and administrative, and advertising and marketing costs that were partially offset by decreases in bad debts and professional fees during the 2024 period. 
 Net Income - The net income after income taxes for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 115,837, as opposed to a net income of 460,474 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This 75 decrease in net income is primarily due to the increase in total operating expenses discussed above.

Revenues - We earn revenues from the sale of our protective gear comprising of neck braces, body armor, helmets and other products, parts and accessories both in the United States and internationally. Revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 32.83 million, a 12 decrease, compared to revenues of 37.44 million for the period ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in worldwide revenue is primarily attributable to a 3.38 million decrease in helmet sales, a 0.86 million decrease in body armor sales, a 0.24 million decrease in other products, part and accessory sales and a 0.13 million decrease in neck brace sales. Revenues generated from sales to our customers in the United States remained consistent at 11.17 million and 11.17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenues associated with international customers were 21.65 million and 26.27 million, or 66 and 70 of revenues, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Although, consumer direct sales increased by 16 and dealer direct sales increased by 4 for the first nine months of 2024, sales to our global distributors decreased by 21 when compared to the first nine months of 2023 as our distributors continued to order conservatively in the context of industry-wide inventory dynamics.

Sales of our flagship neck brace accounted for 1.90 million and 2.03 million, or 6 and 5 of our revenues for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 6 decrease in neck brace revenues is primarily attributable to a 2 decrease in the volume of neck braces sold during the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the prior year period. 
 Our body armor products are comprised of chest protectors, full upper body protectors, upper body protection vests, back protectors, knee braces, knee and elbow guards, off-road motorcycle boots and mountain biking shoes. Body armor sales accounted for 16.34 million and 17.20 million, or 50 and 46 of our revenues for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Although revenues generated on the sale of upper body and limb protection increased by 19 during the first nine months of 2024, the 5 decrease in body armor revenues was primarily the result of a 63 decrease in revenues generated from the sale of footwear, comprising of motorcycle boots and mountain biking shoes, sold during the 2024 period. Footwear has been a particularly constrained category due to post-Covid stocking dynamics on an industry-wide basis. 
 Our Helmets accounted for 6.14 million and 9.52 million, or 19 and 26 of our revenues for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 35 decrease in helmet sales during the 2024 period is primarily attributable to a 45 decrease in the volume of MOTO and MTB helmets sold to our international customers during the 2024 period, when compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, as our distributors continue to manage elevated inventory levels in the context of post-Covid stocking dynamics. 
 Our other products, parts and accessories are comprised of goggles, hydrations bags and apparel items including jerseys, pants, shorts and jackets as well as aftermarket support items required primarily to replace worn or damaged parts through our global distribution network. Other products, parts and accessories sales accounted for 8.45 million and 8.69 million, or 26 and 23 of our revenues for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 3 decrease in revenues from the sale of other products, parts and accessories is primarily due to a 29 decrease in the sales volume of our MOTO and MTB technical apparel lines, designed for motorcycle and mountain biking use that was partially offset by strong shipments of ADV technical apparel, designed for adventure motorcycle riding during the first nine months of 2024. 
 Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit - Cost of revenues for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 19.73 million and 21.20 million, respectively. Gross Profit for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 13.10 million and 16.23 million, respectively, or 40 and 43 of revenues respectively. The 3 decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to specific dealer and consumer direct promotional selling opportunities that were pursued on particularly affected product categories in the United States and South Africa as the Company continues to manage industry-wide stocking and promotional dynamics at the dealer and distributor level. Although demand for our products and participation remains strong, the Company continues to seek opportunities to turn over less current, slower moving inventory categories at pricing levels that are market-related as we move closer to sustainable inventory levels. 
 Product Royalty Income - Product royalty income is earned on sales to distributors that have royalty agreements in place, as well as on sales of licensed products by third parties that have licensing agreements in place. Product royalty income for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 255,789 and 25,151, respectively. The 917 increase in product royalty income is due to an increase in the sale of licensed products to licensees during the 2024 period. 
 Salaries and Wages - Salaries and wages for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4,853,471 and 3,737,382, respectively. The 30 increase in salaries and wages during the 2024 period was primarily due to the employment of professional sales, marketing, brand and account management professionals in the United States and abroad as the Company continues to invest strongly in building and expanding a diversified and focused multi-channel selling operation globally. 
 
 21 

Commissions and Consulting Expense - During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, commissions and consulting expenses were 427,941 and 375,548, respectively. This 14 increase in commissions and consulting expenses during the 2024 period is primarily due to an increase in consulting expenditure incurred as the Company continues to streamline domestic and international sales taxation and operating processes. 
 Professional Fees - Professional fees consist of costs incurred for audit, tax and regulatory filings, as well as patent protection and product liability litigation expenses incurred as the Company continues to expand. Professional fees for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 528,215 and 605,896, respectively. This 13 decrease in professional fees is primarily due to a decrease in expenditure on patent litigation and maintenance expenditure during the 2024 period. 
 Advertising and Marketing - The Company places paid advertising in various motorsport magazines and online media, and sponsors a number of events, teams and individuals to increase product and brand visibility. Advertising and marketing expenses for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3,379,914 and 2,678,960, respectively. The 26 increase in advertising and marketing expenditure during the 2024 period is primarily due to continued strong investment in the production and implementation of marketing campaigns designed to promote brand recognition and the Company's expanding product categories to a wider rider audience, that now includes adventure riders, globally. Additionally, strategic branding activities and direct expenditures on incentives designed to increase customer sales increased, when compared to the prior year period. 
 Office Lease and Expenses - Office lease and expenses for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 456,164 and 457,675, respectively. The decrease in office lease and expenses during the 2024 period is primarily attributable to a decrease in office lease rental expenditures due to the purchase of the Company's head office facility in Cape Town, South Africa. 
 Research and Development Costs - These costs consist of the salaries of personnel who are directly involved in the research and development of innovative products, as well as the direct costs associated with developing these products. Research and development costs for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, decreased to 1,804,590, from 1,828,548, during the same 2023 period. The 1 decrease in research and development costs during the 2024 period is primarily due to a decrease in external product development and certification costs incurred, that were partially offset by an increase in staff costs relating to the employment of design and development staff during the 2024 period, as the Company continues to invest in building a strong pipeline of innovative products. 
 Bad Debt Recovery - Bad debt recovery for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 20,510) and 135,108), respectively. This 85 decrease in bad debt recovery during the 2024 period is primarily the result of a decrease in bad debts that were recovered during the 2024 period, when compared to the prior year comparative period. 
 General and Administrative Expenses - General and administrative expenses consist of insurance, travel, merchant fees, telephone, office and computer supplies. General and administrative expenses for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2,913,079 and 2,516,919, respectively. The 16 increase in general and administrative expenses during the 2024 period is primarily due to an increase in domestic property insurance and merchant fees associated with an increase in consumer direct sales, as the Company continues to intensify its online selling activities. Additionally, travel costs increased as the Company intensified its global product development travel, and selling activities in the United States. 
 Depreciation Expense - Depreciation Expense for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 907,788 and 871,738, respectively. This 4 increase in depreciation during the 2024 period is primarily due to software enhancements utilized to improve consumer engagement and buying activity across the Company's web-based selling platforms. 
 Total Operating Expenses - Total operating expenses increased by 2.31 million to 15.25 million, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.94 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This increase in total operating expenses during the 2024 period is primarily due to increases in salaries, general and administrative and advertising and marketing costs that were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees during the 2024 period. 
 Net Income (Loss) - Net loss after income taxes for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 1.76 million, as opposed to net income after income taxes of 2.26 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net income during the 2024 period is primarily due to the decrease in revenues and gross profit and the increase in total operating expenditures discussed above.

Cash increased by 1.12 million or 10 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to cash on hand at December 31, 2023. The primary sources of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were decreased inventory of 4,491,631, increased accounts payable and accrued expenses of 686,712 and increased long term accounts receivable of 163,470. The primary uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were a net loss of 1,758,205, the repayment of a short term loan amounting to 1,129,966, increased accounts receivable of 861,413, increased prepaid expenses of 548,279, increased payments in advance of 312,249 and capital expenditures of 861,567. 
 The Company is currently meeting its working capital needs through cash on hand, a revolving line of credit with a bank, as well as internally generated cash from operations. Management believes that its current cash and cash equivalent balances, along with the net cash generated by operations are sufficient to meet its anticipated operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. There are currently no plans for any major capital expenditures in the next twelve months. Our long-term financing requirements depend on our growth strategy, which relates primarily to our desire to increase revenue both in the U.S. and abroad. 
 Obligations under Material Contracts

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the following as the items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, estimating allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, leases and accounting for income taxes. 
 
 24 

Revenue and Cost Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 "Revenues from Contracts with Customers". As such the Company has and will continue to review its performance obligations in terms of material customer contractual arrangements in order to verify that revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied on a periodic basis. 
 All manufacturing of Leatt products is performed by third party subcontractors that are predominately based in China. 
 The Company's products are sold worldwide to a global network of distributors and dealers, and directly to consumers when there are no dealers or distributors in their geographic area or where consumers choose to purchase directly via the Company's e-commerce website (collectively the "customers"). 
 Revenues from product sales are recognized when earned, net of applicable provisions for discounts and returns and allowances in the event of product defect where no exchange of product is possible. Revenues are recognized when our performance obligations are satisfied as evidenced by transfer of control of promised goods to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Product royalty income, representing less than 1 of total revenues, is recorded as the underlying product sales occur, in accordance with the related licensing arrangements. 
 Our standard distributor payment terms range from pre-payment in full to sixty (60) days after shipment and subsequent sales of our products by distributors have no effect on the amount and timing of payments due to us, however, in limited instances, qualified distributors and dealers may be granted extended payment terms during selected order periods. In performing such evaluations, the Company utilizes historical experience, sales performance, and credit risk requirements. Furthermore, products purchased by distributors may not be returned to the Company in the event that any such distributor relationship is terminated. 
 Since the Company (through its wholly-owned subsidiary) serves as the distributor of Leatt products in the United States, the Company records its revenue and related cost of revenue for its product sales in the United States upon shipment of the merchandise to the dealer or to the ultimate consumer when there is no dealer in the geographic area or the consumer chooses to purchase directly from the Company's e-commerce website and the sales order was received directly from, and paid by, the ultimate consumer. Since the Company (through its South African branch) serves as the distributor of Leatt products in South Africa, the Company records its revenue and related cost of revenue for its product sales in South Africa upon shipment of the merchandise from the branch to the dealer. The Company's standard terms and conditions of sale for non-consumer direct or web-based sales do not allow for product returns other than under warranty. 
 Sales totaling 0 and 31,671 were deferred as all the requirements to have a contract with the customer in accordance with ASC 606 had not been met as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The shipped goods associated with these deferred sales are included in the caption deferred asset, net of an allowance for potential loss of 0 and 6,400 for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 International sales (other than in the United States and South Africa) are generally drop-shipped directly from our consolidation warehouse or third-party manufacturer to the international distributors. Revenue and related cost of revenue is recognized at the time of shipment from the manufacturer's port when the shipping terms are Free On Board ("FOB") shipping point, Cost and Freight ("CFR") or Cost and Insurance to named place ("CIP") as legal title and risk of loss to the product pass to the distributor. Sales to all customers (distributors, dealers and consumers) are generally final; however, in limited instances, product may be returned and exchanged due to product quality issues. Historically, returns due to product quality issues have not been material and there have been no distributor terminations that resulted in product returns. Cost of revenues also includes royalty fees associated with sales of Leatt-Brace products. Product royalty income is recorded as the underlying product sales occur, in accordance with the related licensing arrangements. 
 The Company reviews the reserves for customer returns at each reporting period and adjusts them to reflect data available at that time. To estimate reserves for returns, the Company estimates the expected returns and claims based on historical rates as well as events and circumstances that indicate changes to historical rates of product returns and claims. Historically, returns due to product quality issues have not been material and there have been no distributor terminations that resulted in product returns. The provision for estimated returns at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was -0- and -0-, respectively. 
 
 25 

Sales commissions are expensed when incurred, which is generally at the time of sale or cash received from customers, because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in commissions and consulting expenses within operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 Shipping and handling activities associated with outbound freight, after control over a product has transferred to a customer, are accounted for as a fulfilment cost and are included in revenues and cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 Revenue recognized from contracts with customers is recorded net of sales taxes, value added taxes, or similar taxes that are collected on behalf of local taxing authorities. 
 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable - Accounts receivable consist of amounts due to the Company from normal business activities. Credit is granted to substantially all distributors on an unsecured basis. We continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon the expected credit losses determined utilizing historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified. In determining the amount of the allowance, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions. Accounts receivable balances that are still outstanding after we have used reasonable collection efforts are written off as uncollectible. While such credit losses have historically been minimal, within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results. The allowance for short-term doubtful accounts was 645,618 at September 30, 2024 and 662,612 at December 31, 2023, respectively. Additionally, an allowance for long-term doubtful accounts will be included for accounts receivables that are anticipated to be collected over a period that is greater than 12 months. The allowance for long-term doubtful accounts at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 12,676 and 26,929, respectively. 
 Inventory Valuation - Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory consists primarily of finished goods. Shipping and handling costs are included in the cost of inventory. In assessing the inventory value, we make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence, aging of inventory and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products. In performing such evaluations, we utilize historical experience as well as current market information. The reserve for obsolescence at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 355,624 and 227,528, respectively 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Our long-lived assets include property and equipment. We evaluate our long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition. If the expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss, equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset, is recognized. We have determined there were no impairment charges during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Operating Leases - The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. Operating leases are included in the right-of-use assets ("ROU''), and lease liability obligations are included in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset of the lease term and lease liability obligations represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date, based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company's leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and lease direct costs. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 Income Taxes - As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We regularly evaluate our ability to recover the reported amount of our deferred income taxes considering several factors, including our estimate of the likelihood of the Company generating sufficient taxable income in future years during the period over which the temporary differences reverse.
