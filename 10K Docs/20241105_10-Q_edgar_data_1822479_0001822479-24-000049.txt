 (a) Includes certain transportation certifications, a class 1B nuclear license and other intangibles related to obtaining such licensure. These assets are considered indefinite-lived as the decision for renewal by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is highly based on a licensee s previous assessments, reported incidents, and annual compliance and inspection results. New applications for license can take a significant amount of time and cost; whereas an existing licensee with a historical record of compliance and current operating conditions more than likely ensures renewal for another year license period as Nordion has demonstrated over its 75 years of history.

We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge designed to hedge the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in the SOFR benchmark interest rate of our variable rate borrowings. We receive interest at the one-month Term SOFR rate and pay a fixed interest rate under the terms of the swap agreement.

 interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional amount of million for a total option premium of million. The interest rate caps became effective as of July 31, 2023 and expired on July 31, 2024. We designated these interest rate caps as cash flow hedges designed to hedge the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate of our variable rate borrowings. Accordingly, the interest rate cap agreements hedged the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in SOFR by limiting our cash flow exposure related to Term SOFR under a portion of our variable rate borrowings to . 
 In October 2021, we entered into interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional amount of million for a total option premium of million. Both interest rate caps were effective on December 31, 2022 and expired on July 31, 2023. These interest rate caps were designated as cash flow hedges and were designed to hedge the variability of cash flows attributable to changes in LIBOR (or its successor), the benchmark interest rate being hedged, by limiting our cash flow exposure related to the LIBOR base rate under a portion of our variable rate borrowings to . 
 Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships 
 Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into interest rate derivatives to manage economic risks associated with our variable rate borrowings that are not designated in hedge relationships. These instruments were recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with any changes in fair value recorded in Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 The Company also routinely enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk of our intercompany loans in certain of our international subsidiaries and non-functional currency assets and liabilities. The foreign currency forward contracts expire on a monthly basis.

 We expect to reclassify approximately million of pre-tax net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to income during the next 12 months associated with our cash flow hedges. Refer to Note 11, Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for unrealized gains and losses on interest rate derivatives, net of applicable tax, recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense, net of applicable tax, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Credit Risk 
 Certain of our financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents, are exposed to credit risk. 
 We are also exposed, in our normal course of business, to credit risk from our customers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accounts receivable was net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts of million and million, respectively. 
 Credit risk on financial instruments arises from the potential for counterparties to default on their contractual obligations to us. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance, but do not anticipate non-performance by any of the counterparties to our financial instruments. We limit our credit risk by dealing with counterparties that are considered to be of high credit quality. In the event of non-performance by counterparties, the carrying value of our financial instruments represents the maximum amount of loss that would be incurred. 
 Our credit team evaluates and regularly monitors changes in the credit risk of our customers. We routinely assess the collectability of accounts receivable and maintain an adequate allowance for uncollectible accounts to address potential credit losses. The process includes a review of customer financial information and credit ratings, current market conditions as well as the expected future economic conditions that may impact the collection of trade receivables. We regularly review our customers past due amounts through an analysis of aged accounts receivables, specific customer past due aging amounts, and the history of trade receivables written off. Upon concluding that a receivable balance is not collectible, the balance is written off against the allowance for uncollectible accounts. 
 Fair Value Hierarchy 
 The fair value of our financial instruments is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The valuation techniques we would use to determine such fair values are described as follows: Level 1 fair values determined by inputs utilizing quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 fair values based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable; Level 3 fair values determined by unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.

Embedded derivatives are valued using internally developed models that rely on observable market inputs, including foreign currency forward curves. Foreign currency forward contracts are valued by reference to changes in the forward foreign currency exchange rate over the life of the contract. 
 (c) Carrying amounts of current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt instruments are reported net of discounts and debt issuance costs.

 OVERVIEW 
 We are a leading global provider of mission-critical end-to-end sterilization solutions, lab testing and advisory services for the healthcare industry. We are driven by our mission: Safeguarding Global Health . We provide end-to-end sterilization as well as microbiological and analytical lab testing and advisory services to help ensure that medical, pharmaceutical and food products are safe for healthcare practitioners, patients and consumers in the United States and around the world. Our services are an essential aspect of our customers manufacturing process and supply chains, helping to ensure sterilized medical products reach healthcare practitioners and patients. Most of these services are necessary for our customers to satisfy applicable government requirements. 
 We serve our customers throughout their product lifecycles, from product design to manufacturing and delivery, helping to ensure the sterility, effectiveness and safety of their products for the end user. We operate across two core businesses: sterilization services and lab services. The combination of Sterigenics, our terminal sterilization business, and Nordion, our Co-60 supply business, makes us the only vertically integrated global gamma sterilization provider in the sterilization industry. For financial reporting purposes, our sterilization services business consists of two reportable segments, Sterigenics and Nordion, and our lab services business consists of one reportable segment, Nelson Labs. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, we recorded net revenues of 285.5 million and 810.2 million, net income of 17.0 million and 32.1 million, Adjusted Net Income of 48.9 million and 139.8 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of 146.4 million and 395.6 million.

 STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENTS AND KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following summarizes strategic developments and key factors that have impacted our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and may continue to affect our performance and financial condition in future periods. 
 Business and market conditions . Consolidated net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8.5 and 9.6 , respectively, compared to the same period of the prior year, mainly driven by higher volumes across all segments and favorability in pricing. 
 As discussed in more detail in our 2023 10-K, a portion of our supply of Co-60 is generated by Russian nuclear 
 reactors. We continue to monitor the potential for future disruption in the supply of Co-60 from Russian nuclear reactors. There was no impact to our supply or revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investment initiatives. We continue to advance our growth-related investments, including our two active capacity expansion projects within the Sterigenics segment, Co-60 development projects in the Nordion segment and lab expansion efforts to support pharma testing services in the Nelson Labs segment. 
 Disciplined and strategic M A activity . We remain committed to our highly disciplined acquisition strategy and continue to seek suitable acquisition targets. 
 Litigation costs . We are currently the subject of tort lawsuits alleging injury by purported exposure to EO used, emitted or released by current facilities in Atlanta, Georgia and Los Angeles, California and our former facility in Willowbrook, Illinois. In addition, we are defendants in a lawsuit brought by the State of New Mexico Attorney General alleging that emissions of EO from our Santa Teresa facility negatively impacted Santa Teresa and surrounding communities. We maintain that these facilities did not pose and do not pose any safety risk to their surrounding communities. We deny the allegations in these lawsuits and are vigorously defending against these claims. See Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings and Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements. 
 31 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded costs of 8.2 million and 22.4 million, respectively, representing professional fees and other expenses related to litigation associated with our EO sterilization facilities. 
 
 Borrowings and financial leverage . On May 30, 2024, the Company and SHH entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which provided for the issuance of term loans to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of 1.5 billion maturing on May 30, 2031. On the same date, the Company issued Secured Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 750.0 million, which bear interest at an annual rate of 7.375 and mature on June 1, 2031. The proceeds from the Refinancing Term Loans and the issuance of the Secured Notes, along with cash on the balance sheet, were used to refinance all of the Company s previously outstanding term loans due December 2026.

Amortization of intangible assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets decreased 0.3 million, or 1.7 , to 15.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due mainly to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net increased 0.9 million, or 2.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was driven by a 3.6 million net unfavorable change from interest rate derivative activity, partially offset by a decrease in in the interest rate on variable rate borrowings, resulting in 2.4 million of decline in interest expense. 
 Foreign Exchange Gain 
 Foreign exchange gain was 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a gain of 0.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in foreign exchange gain in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) mainly relates to short-term gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating entities. As describ ed in Note 15, Financial Instruments and Financial Risk to our consolidated financial statements, we enter into monthly U.S. dollar-denominated foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our international subsidiaries. 
 Other (Income) Expense, Net 
 Other income, net was 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other expense, net of 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The fluctuation was mainly driven by changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives in Nordion s contracts, resulting in a 3.0 million increase in other income. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income tax increased 11.6 million to a net provision of 25.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 14.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was driven by higher pre-tax income in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 (driven mainly by a 35.0 million Georgia EO litigation settlement accrual as described in the 2023 10-K) and an incremental increase in the valuation allowance attributable to the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense. 
 Provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the statutory rate primarily due to a net increase in the valuation allowance attributable to the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense, the impact of the foreign rate differential and global intangible low-tax income GILTI ), partially offset by a benefit for state income taxes. Provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2023 d iffered from the statutory rate primarily due to a net increase in the valuation allowance attributable to the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense, the foreign rate differential, and GILTI, partially offset by a benefit for state income taxes. The increase in the valuation allowance in the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a 35.0 million Georgia EO litigation settlement which resulted in additional interest limitation. 
 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.0 million, as compared to a net loss of 13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the factors described above.

 SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 We have three reportable segments: Sterigenics, Nordion and Nelson Labs. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources within our business based on Segment Income, which excludes certain items which are included in income before tax as determined in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The accounting policies for our reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. 
 Our Segments 
 Sterigenics 
 Sterigenics provides outsourced terminal sterilization and irradiation services for the medical device, pharmaceutical, food safety and advanced applications markets using three major technologies: gamma irradiation, EO processing and E-beam irradiation. 
 37 

Nordion 
 Nordion is a leading global provider of Co-60 used in the sterilization and irradiation processes for the medical device, pharmaceutical, food safety, and high-performance materials industries, as well as in the treatment of cancer. In addition, Nordion is a leading global provider of gamma irradiation systems. 
 As a result of the time required to meet regulatory and logistics requirements for delivery of radioactive products, combined with accommodations made to our customers to minimize disruptions to their operations during the installation of Co-60, Nordion sales patterns can often vary significantly from one quarter to the next. However, timing-related impacts on our sales performance tend to be resolved within several quarters, resulting in more consistent performance over longer periods of time. In addition, sales of gamma irradiation systems occur infrequently and tend to be for larger amounts. 
 Results for our Nordion segment are also impacted by Co-60 mix, harvest schedules, as well as customer, product and service mix. 
 Nelson Labs 
 Nelson Labs provides outsourced microbiological and analytical chemistry testing and advisory services for the medical device and pharmaceutical industries. 
 For more information regarding our reportable segments, please refer to Note 16, Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we consider Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA, financial measures that are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP. 
 We define Adjusted Net Income as net income before amortization and certain other adjustments that we do not consider in our evaluation of our ongoing operating performance from period to period as discussed further below. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Income before interest expense, depreciation (including depreciation of Co-60 used in our operations) and income tax provision applicable to Adjusted Net Income. 
 We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measures, as the principal measures of our operating performance. Management believes Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow management to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without the impact of certain non-cash items and non-routine items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future and other items that are not core to our operations. We believe that these measures are useful to our investors because they provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. In addition, we believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA will assist investors in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented. Our management also uses Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA in their financial analysis and operational decision-making, and Adjusted EBITDA serves as the basis for the metric we utilize to determine attainment of our primary annual incentive program. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, a similarly titled measure used by other companies. 
 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent. For example, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA primarily exclude: 
 certain recurring non-cash charges such as depreciation of fixed assets, although these assets may have to be replaced in the future, as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and asset retirement obligations; 
 costs of acquiring and integrating businesses, which will continue to be a part of our growth strategy; 
 non-cash gains or losses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and the mark-to-fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, which includes the embedded derivatives relating to certain customer and supply contracts at Nordion; 
 impairment charges on long-lived assets, intangible assets and investments accounted for under the equity method;

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Sources of Cash 
 The primary sources of liquidity for our business are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 306.7 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. This is a decrease of 10.3 million from the balance at December 31, 2023. The decrease in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents was a result of 113.2 million in cash paid for capital expenditures, 44.0 million in cash used in financing activities, partially offset by 168.4 million of cash flows provided by operating activities, which includes a 35.0 million payment of the Georgia EO litigation settlement in January 2024. Our foreign subsidiaries held cash of approximately 297.8 million at September 30, 2024 and 224.1 million at December 31, 2023. No material restrictions exist to accessing cash held by our foreign subsidiaries notwithstanding any potential tax consequences. 
 As described in more detail below, on March 1, 2024, the Company and SHH entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Revolving Credit Facility. Amendment No. 3 did not materially change to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, including with respect to the amount of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, which remains 423.8 million. 
 As discussed below, on May 30, 2024 the Company and SHH closed on the Refinancing Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of 1,509.4 million as well as an issuance of Secured Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 750.0 million, both of which mature in 2031. The Company used the net proceeds from the Refinancing Term Loans and Secured Notes, along with cash on hand, to refinance its previously outstanding 1,763.1 million and 496.3 million Term Loans due 2026. 
 
 Uses of Cash 
 We expect that cash on hand, operating cash flows and amounts available under our credit facilities will provide sufficient working capital to operate our business, meet foreseeable liquidity requirements (inclusive of debt service on our long-term debt), make expected capital expenditures including investments in fixed assets to build and/or expand existing facilities, and meet litigation costs that we expect to continue to incur for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Our primary long-term liquidity requirements beyond the next twelve months will be to service our debt, make capital expenditures, and fund suitable business acquisitions. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect any excess cash provided by operations will be allocated to fund capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, or for other general corporate purposes. Our ability to meet future working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of macroeconomic, competitive and business factors, including interest rate changes and changes in our industry, many of which are outside of our control. As of September 30, 2024, our interest rate derivatives limit our cash flow exposure of our variable rate borrowings under the Term Loans. Refer to Note 15, Financial Instruments and Financial Risk , Derivative Instruments to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about changes in interest rate risk.

Capital Expenditures 
 Our capital expenditure program is a component of our long-term strategy. This program includes, among other things, investments in new and existing facilities, business expansion projects, Co-60 used by Sterigenics at its gamma irradiation facilities, cobalt development projects and information technology enhancements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our capital expenditures amounted to 113.2 million, compared to 150.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Cash Flow Information (thousands of U.S. dollars) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net Cash Provided by (Used in): Operating activities 168,447 (260,855) Investing activities (113,126) (150,080) Financing activities (44,016) 269,752 Effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (4,477) (2,577) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash 6,828 (143,760) 
 Operating activities 
 Cash flows from operating activities increased 429.3 million to net cash provided of 168.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used of 260.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the timing of the settlement fund release of approximately 408.0 million on June 30, 2023 in connection with the settlements of the Illinois EO claims and an increase in operating income of 37.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Investing activities 
 Cash used by investing activities decreased 37.0 million to net cash used of 113.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 150.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The variance was primarily driven by a decrease in cash paid for capital expenditures of 36.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing activities 
 Cash used in financing activities was 44.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 269.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a net change of 313.8 million. The difference was mainly attributable to 298.8 million of debt proceeds (net of repayments) in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 1.3 million of debt repayments (net of debt proceeds) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash outflows for debt issuance costs also increased 6.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. In addition, a purchase option for a leased facility was exercised in the first quarter of 2024 resulting in a 6.7 million cash outflow. 
 Debt Facilities 
 Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
 
 On December 13, 2019, Sotera Health Holdings, LLC SHH ), our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into senior secured first lien credit facilities (the Senior Secured Credit Facilities ), consisting of both a prepayable senior secured first lien term loan (the Term Loan and a senior secured first lien revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to a first lien credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ). The total borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility is 423.8 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also provide SHH the right at any time and under certain conditions to request 
 43 

incremental term loans or incremental revolving credit commitments based on a formula defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 
 On May 30, 2024, the Company and SHH entered into Amendment No. 4 Amendment No. 4 to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Among other changes, Amendment No. 4 provides for term loans (the Refinancing Term Loans to SHH in an aggregate principal amount of 1,509.4 million. Pursuant to Amendment No. 4, the Refinancing Term Loans shall have an applicable interest rate margin per annum equal to (i) ABR plus 2.25 for ABR Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement), (ii) daily simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 3.25 for RFR Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (iii) Term SOFR plus 3.25 for Term Benchmark Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case with a 0.00 applicable floor and the applicable interest rate margin shall be subject to a pricing step-down of 0.25 when the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than or equal to 3.30:1.00. The Refinancing Term Loans are also subject to a soft call premium of 1.00 for certain repricing transactions with respect to the Refinancing Term Loans that occur within the six-month period after the effective date of Amendment No. 4. The Refinancing Term Loans amortize at a rate of 1.00 per annum and mature on May 30, 2031. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Refinancing Term Loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.56 . 
 
 On May 30, 2024, SHH, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company (the Guarantors ), and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, paying agent, registrar, transfer agent and notes collateral agent, entered into an indenture (the Indenture governing SHH s newly issued 750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375 senior secured notes due 2031 (the Secured Notes ). The Secured Notes will pay interest semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024, at a rate of 7.375 per year, and will mature on June 1, 2031. The Secured Notes may be redeemed, at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, on or after June 1, 2027 at the redemption prices specified in the Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time or from time to time, prior to June 1, 2027, the Secured Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, at any time or from time to time, prior to June 1, 2027, SHH may redeem up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes (including any additional Secured Notes issued under the Indenture) with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 107.375 of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. Further, at any time or from time to time, on or before June 1, 2027, SHH may redeem up to 10 of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes (including any additional Secured Notes issued under the Indenture) during each of the twelve-month periods after the issue date, at a redemption price equal to 103 of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
 
 The obligations under the Indenture are secured pursuant to a security agreement, dated as of May 30, 2024, by and among SHH, the Company, the other grantors party thereto, and Wilmington Trust, National Association (the Security Agreement ), as may be amended from time to time, and related financing statements. 
 The Company used the combined net proceeds from the Refinancing Terms Loans and Secured Notes, along with cash on hand, to refinance its previously outstanding 1,763.1 million Term Loan due 2026 and 496.3 million Term Loan B due 2026. 
 
 On March 1, 2024, the Company and SHH entered into Amendment No. 3 Amendment No. 3 to the Revolving Credit Facility. Among other changes, Amendment No. 3 provides (i) for new commitments under the existing Revolving Credit Facility to replace the existing revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of 83.0 million, (ii) that certain of the lenders providing revolving credit commitments shall also provide additional commitments for the issuance of letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of 37.5 million and (iii) for the extension of the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to March 1, 2029. 
 The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture contain additional covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, limitations and qualifications, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to engage in certain activities, such as incur additional indebtedness or permit to exist any lien on any property or asset now owned or hereafter acquired, as specified in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including upon a change of control. In addition, an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture would occur if the Company or certain of its subsidiaries received one or more enforceable judgments for payment in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of (i) 162.6 million or (ii) 30.0 of consolidated EBITDA or LTM EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement and the Indenture, respectively) and the judgments were not stayed or remained undischarged for a period of 60 consecutive days. As of 
 44 

September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture. 
 All of SHH s obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and each existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of the Company, with customary exceptions including, among other things, where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in material adverse tax consequences. All obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture, and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured by substantially all assets of the borrower and guarantors, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions and exclusions, as outlined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Indenture and the Security Agreement. 
 Outstanding letters of credit are collateralized by encumbrances against the Revolving Credit Facility and the collateral pledged thereunder, or by cash placed on deposit with the issuing bank. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 23.9 million of letters of credit issued against the Revolving Credit Facility, resulting in total availability under the Revolving Credit Facility of 399.9 million. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions at a specific point in time and in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts, giving due consideration to materiality. The application of accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 A comprehensive discussion of the Company s critical accounting policies and management estimates made in connection with the preparation of the financial statements is included in Item 7 of 2023 10-K. There have been no significant changes in critical accounting policies, management estimates or accounting policies since the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 For a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business, see Note 2, Recent Accounting Standards to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risks are described within Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A of our 2023 Form 10-K. These market risks have not materially changed for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Part II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may be subject to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including claims relating to personal injury, property damage, workers compensation and employee safety and our disclosures as a Nasdaq-listed, publicly-traded company. In addition, from time to time, we receive communications from government or regulatory agencies concerning investigations or allegations of noncompliance with laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. At this time, and except as is noted herein, we are unable to predict the outcome of, and cannot reasonably estimate the impact of, any pending litigation matters, matters concerning allegations of non-compliance with laws or regulations and matters concerning other allegations of other improprieties, or the incidence of any such matters in the future. Information regarding our material legal proceedings is included below. 
 Legal Proceedings Described in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies , to Our Consolidated Financial Statements 
 Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes information on legal proceedings that constitute material contingencies for financial reporting purposes that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. This item should be read in conjunction with Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies for information regarding the following legal proceedings, which information is incorporated into this item by reference: 
 Ethylene Oxide Tort Litigation Illinois, Georgia, California and New Mexico; 
 Insurance Coverage for Environmental Liabilities; and 
 Sotera Health Company Securities Litigation and Related Matters. 
 Legal Proceedings That Are Not Described in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies to Our Consolidated Financial Statements 
 In addition to the matters that are identified in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and incorporated into this item by reference, the following matters also constitute material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary course litigation incidental to our business, to which we are or any of our subsidiaries is a party. SEC regulations require disclosure of environmental proceedings that involve a government authority and potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed a specified threshold. Effective January 1, 2024, except for the previously disclosed Notices of Violation issued to Sterigenics facilities in Los Angeles, California and Ontario, California (as described below), the Company uses a threshold of 1.0 million to determine whether the disclosure of any such proceedings is required because we believe matters under this threshold are not material to the Company. 
 
 Notices of Violation at Vernon and Ontario, California Ethylene Oxide Sterilization Facilities 
 
 In 2022, the South Coast Air Quality Management District SCAQMD in Southern California initiated an investigation into EO sterilization facilities located in the SCAQMD region, including Sterigenics facilities in Vernon and Ontario, California. In connection with this investigation, SCAQMD issued ten NOVs to the Vernon and Ontario facilities alleging violations of SCAQMD operational, maintenance, permitting and reporting requirements and that levels of ambient EO detected by SCAQMD during 2022 caused a public nuisance for off-site workers around the facilities. In August 2024, Sterigenics and SCAQMD entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which Sterigenics paid 587,800 to settle seven of the NOVs, excluding the three NOVs alleging a public nuisance (which SCAQMD elected not to prosecute and therefore are expressly not part of the basis for the settlement). The settlement agreement expressly provides that Sterigenics denies any liability and that the agreement is not to be construed as an admission of liability or violations of SCAQMD s requirements. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our 2023 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024, and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 2, 2024.
