billion (Whitebridge 
 Pet Brands acquisition). 
We 
expect to close 
the transaction in 
the third quarter 
of fiscal 2025, 
subject to regulatory 
approval and other 
 customary closing conditions. We 
intend to fund the acquisition with cash on hand. 
 During 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2025, 
we 
entered 
into 
definitive 
agreements 
to 
sell 
our 
North 
American 
yogurt 
businesses 
to 
 affiliates 
of 
Groupe 
Lactalis 
S.A. 
(Lactalis) 
and 
Sodiaal 
International 
(Sodiaal) 
for 
approximately 

billion. 
We 
expect 
to 
close 
 these divestitures in calendar year 2025, subject to regulatory 
approvals and other customary closing conditions. We 
have classified all 
 assets and 
liabilities associated 
with our 
North American 
yogurt businesses 
as held 
for sale 
in our 
Consolidated Balance 
Sheets as 
of 
 November 24, 2024. 
 The components of assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale are as follows:

million, net of 
cash 
 acquired. 
During 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2025, 
we 
paid 

million 
related 
to 
a 
purchase 
price 
holdback 
after 
certain 
closing 
 conditions 
were 
met. 
 We 
 financed 
the 
transaction 
with 
cash 
on 
hand. 
We 
consolidated 
the 
business 
into 
our 
Consolidated 
Balance 
 Sheets 
and 
recorded 
goodwill 
of 

million, 
an 
indefinite-lived 
brand 
intangible 
asset 
of 

million 
and 
a 
finite-lived 
 customer 
relationship 
asset 
of 

million. 
The 
goodwill 
is 
included 
in 
the 
International 
segment 
and 
is 
not 
deductible 
for 
tax 
 purposes. The pro forma effects 
of this acquisition were not 
material. We 
have conducted a preliminary assessment 
of the fair value of 
 the acquired 
assets and 
liabilities of 
the business 
and we 
are continuing 
our review 
of these 
items during 
the measurement 
period. If 
 new 
information 
is 
obtained 
about 
facts 
and 
circumstances 
that 
existed 
at 
the 
acquisition 
date, 
the

of 
restructuring 
charges 
in 
the 
six-month 
period 
ended 
 November 24, 
2024, related 
to restructuring 
actions previously 
announced. We 
recorded 

million of 
restructuring charges 
in the 
 second quarter of 
fiscal 2024 and 

million of restructuring 
charges in the 
six-month period ended 
November 26, 2023, 
related to 
 restructuring actions previously announced. 
We expect these actions to 
be completed by the end of fiscal 2026. 
 In the second 
quarter of fiscal 
2024, we recorded 
a 

million non-cash goodwill 
impairment charge 
related to our Latin 
America 
 reporting unit. Please see Note 4 for additional information. 
 We 
paid 
net 

million 
of 
cash 
in 
the 
six-month 
period 
ended 
November 
24, 
2024, 
related 
to

We

 We also 
have net investments in foreign 
subsidiaries that are denominated 
in euros. As of November 
24, 2024, we hedged a 
portion of 
 these investments with 

million of euro-denominated bonds. 
 During the 
second quarter of 
fiscal 2025, in 
advance of planned 
debt financing, 
we entered into 

million of treasury 
locks. The 
 treasury locks were terminated during the second quarter 
of fiscal 2025, in conjunction with the Company s 
issuance of 

million 
 of 
fixed-rate 
notes 
due 
 
 . 
Upon 
termination, 
a 
gain 
of 

million 
was recognized 
in AOCI 
and 
will be 
amortized 
 through interest expense over the respective term of the debt. 
 During the 
second quarter 
of fiscal 
2025, we 
entered into 
a 

million notional 
amount interest 
rate swap 
to convert 
our 
 
 million of fixed-rate notes due January 30, 2030, to a floating rate. 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, our 

million notional amount interest rate swap to convert 
our 

million of fixed-
 rate notes due 
November 18, 2025 
to a floating 
rate was called 
by the counterparty 
prior to the 
maturity date. The 
previously existing 
 swap was designated 
as a fair value 
hedge, and concurrent 
with the swap 
being called, we 
ceased recording 
market value adjustments 
 to the associated hedged debt. 
 The 
fair

the 
derivative 
positions

in

We

 significantly change our valuation techniques from prior periods. 

 We 
offer 
certain 
suppliers 
access 
to 
third-party 
services 
that 
allow 
them 
to 
view 
our 
scheduled

online. 
The 
third-party 
 services also 
allow suppliers 
to finance 
advances on 
our scheduled 
payments at 
the sole 
discretion of 
the supplier 
and the third 
party. 
 We 
have no 
economic interest 
in these 
financing arrangements 
and no 
direct relationship 
with the

growth, 
create 
fuel 
for 
investment, 
and 
drive 
strong

for 
consumers, 
we 
are 
focused 
on 
delivering 
remarkable 
 experiences across our leading food brands, resulting in sustainable improvement 
in volume growth and market share trends over time. 
 Our 
fiscal

 CONSOLIDATED 
RESULTS 
OF OPERATIONS 
 Second Quarter Results 
 In 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2025, 
net 
sales 
increased 
2 
percent 
and 
organic 
net 
sales 
increased 
1 
percent 
compared 
to 
the 
same 
 period last 
year. 
Operating profit 
increased 33 
percent to 
 1,078 million, 
primarily driven 
by a 
goodwill impairment 
charge recorded 
 in 
fiscal 
2024 
and 
lower 
restructuring 
charges, 
lower 
input 
costs, 
a 
favorable 
change 
in 
the 
mark-to-market 
valuation 
of 
certain 
 commodity 
positions 
and 
grain 
inventories, 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
contributions 
from 
volume growth, 
partially 
offset 
by an 
increase 
in 
 selling, general 
and administrative 
(SG A) expenses 
and unfavorable 
net price 
realization and 
mix. Operating 
profit margin 
of 20.6 
 percent 
increased 
480 
basis 
points. 
Adjusted 
operating 
profit 
of 
 1,064 
million 
increased 
7 
percent 
on 
a 
constant-currency 
basis, 
 primarily driven 
by lower 
input costs 
and an 
increase in 
contributions 
from volume 
growth, partially 
offset by 
an increase 
in SG A 
 expenses and 
unfavorable net 
price realization 
and mix. 
Adjusted operating 
profit margin 
increased 100 
basis points 
to 20.3 
percent. 
 Diluted earnings 
per share 
of 1.42 
increased 39 
percent in 
the second 
quarter of 
fiscal 2025. 
Adjusted diluted 
earnings per 
share of 
 1.40 
increased 
12 
percent 
on 
a 
constant-currency 
basis 
compared 
to 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2024.

 Net sales in the 
second quarter of fiscal 
2025 increased 2 percent 
compared to the same 
period in fiscal 2024, 
driven by an increase 
in 
 contributions from volume growth, partially offset by 
unfavorable net price realization and mix. 
 Components of organic net sales growth are shown in the following

 Organic 
net sales 
increased 1 
percent in 
the second 
quarter of 
fiscal 2025 
compared to 
the same 
period in 
fiscal 2024, 
driven by 
an 
 increase in contributions from organic volume growth, 
partially offset by unfavorable organic net price realization 
and mix. 
 Cost of sales 
 decreased 64 million to 3,309 
million in the second quarter 
of fiscal 2025 compared 
to the same period 
in fiscal 2024. 
 The decrease 
was primarily 
driven by 
an 87 million 
decrease attributable 
to product 
rate and 
mix, partially 
offset by 
an 85 
million 
 increase 
attributable 
to 
volume. 
We 
recorded 
a 
 29 million 
net 
decrease 
in 
cost 
of 
sales 
related 
to 
the 
mark-to-market 
valuation 
of 
 certain commodity 
positions and 
grain inventories 
in the 
second quarter 
of fiscal 
2025, compared 
to a 
 25 million net 
increase in 
the 
 second 
quarter 
of fiscal 
2024. 
We 
recorded 
 8 
million 
of 
restructuring 
charges 
in 
the 
second 
quarter of 
fiscal 
2024 
(please refer 
to 
 Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report). 

 SG A 
expenses 
 increased 
 22 million 
to 
 852 million 
in 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2025, 
compared 
to 
the 
same 
period 
in 
fiscal 
 2024, 
primarily driven by an increase in 
certain compensation and benefits expenses 
and the addition of a pet food business 
in Europe. 
 SG A expenses as a percent 
of net sales in the 
second quarter of fiscal 2025 
increased 10 basis points compared 
to the second quarter 
 of fiscal 2024. 
 Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs 
 totaled 1 million in the second quarter of 
fiscal 2025, 
compared to 124 million in 
 the 
same 
period 
last 
year. 
We 
recorded 
 1 
million 
of 
charges 
in 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2025 
related 
to 
actions 
previously 
 announced compared 
to 6 million in 
the same period 
last year. 
In the second 
quarter of fiscal 2024, 
we recorded a 117 
million non-
 cash 
goodwill 
impairment 
charge 
related 
to 
our 
Latin 
America 
reporting 
unit 
(please 
refer 
to 
Note 
3 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
 Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report). 
 Benefit plan non-service income 
 totaled 14 million in the second quarter 
of fiscal 2025, compared to 20 
million in the same period 
 last year, primarily reflecting higher 
amortization of losses and interest costs. 

 Interest, net 
 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 
totaled 125 million, up 7 million from the second quarter 
of fiscal 2024, primarily 
 driven by higher average long-term debt levels. 
 The 
 effective tax rate
 
for the second quarter 
of fiscal 2025 was 20.1 
percent compared to 19.0 
percent for the second 
quarter of fiscal 
 2024. The 
1.1 percentage 
point increase was 
primarily due 
to certain nonrecurring 
discrete tax benefits 
in the second 
quarter of 
fiscal 
 2024, partially 
offset by 
favorable earnings 
mix by 
jurisdiction in 
the second 
quarter of 
fiscal 2025. 
Our effective 
tax rate 
excluding 
 certain 
items 
affecting 
comparability 
was 
20.1 
percent 
in 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2025, 
compared 
to 
20.8 
percent 
in 
the 
same 
 period last 
year (see 
the Non-GAAP 
Measures section 
below for 
a description 
of our 
use of 
measures not 
defined by 
GAAP). The 
 0.7 percentage point decrease was primarily due to favorable earnings 
mix by jurisdiction in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. 

23 
 After-tax earnings from 
joint ventures
 
for the second quarter 
of fiscal 2025
 increased to 30 million compared 
to 24 million in the 
 same 
period 
in 
fiscal 
2024, 
primarily 
due 
to 
lower 
input 
costs 
and 
favorable 
net 
price 
realization 
and 
mix 
at 
Cereal 
Partners 
 Worldwide 
(CPW), partially 
offset 
by 
higher SG A 
expenses and 
a decrease 
in volume 
at CPW 
and 
higher 
input costs 
at H agen-
 Dazs 
Japan, 
Inc. 
(HDJ). 
On 
a 
constant-currency 
basis, 
after-tax

 Six-Month Results 
 In 
the 
six-month 
period 
ended 
November 
24, 
2024, 
net 
sales 
and 
organic 
net 
sales 
essentially 
matched 
the 
same 
period 
last 
year. 
 Operating profit increased 10 percent 
to 1,909 million, primarily driven 
by a goodwill impairment charge 
recorded in fiscal 2024 and 
 lower 
restructuring charges 
, 
lower input 
costs, and 
an increase 
in contributions 
from volume 
growth, partially 
offset 
by unfavorable 
 net price 
realization and 
mix and 
an increase 
in SG A 
expenses. Operating 
profit margin 
of 18.9 
percent increased 
160 basis 
points 
 compared to 
the same 
period last 
year. 
Adjusted operating 
profit of 
 1,929 million 
increased 2 
percent on 
a constant-currency 
basis, 
 primarily driven 
by lower 
input costs 
and an 
increase in 
contributions from 
volume growth, 
partially offset 
by unfavorable 
net price 
 realization 
and mix 
and an 
increase in 
SG A expenses 
. 
Adjusted operating 
profit margin 
increased 30 
basis points 
to 19.1 
percent.

 Organic net sales in the six-month period ended 
November 24, 2024, essentially matched the same period in fiscal 2024. 
 Cost 
of 
sales
 
decreased 
 39 million 
to 
 6,468 
million 
in 
the 
six-month 
period 
ended 
November 
24, 
2024, 
compared 
to 
the 
same 
 period in fiscal 2024. The decrease 
was primarily driven by a 
 133 
million decline attributable to product 
rate and mix, partially offset 
 by a 92 
million increase attributable 
to volume. We 
recorded a 1 million 
net decrease in 
cost of sales 
related to the 
mark-to-market 
 valuation 
of 
certain 
commodity 
positions 
and 
grain 
inventories 
in 
the 
six-month 
period 
ended 
November 
24, 
2024, 
compared 
to 
a 
 20 million 
net 
decrease 
in 
the 
six-month 
period 
ended 
November 
26, 
2023. 
In 
addition, 
we 
recorded 
 1 
million 
of 
restructuring 
 charges in 
cost of 
sales in 
the six-month 
period ended 
November 24, 
2024, compared 
to 17 
million of 
restructuring charges 
and 1 
 million 
of 
restructuring 
initiative 
project-related 
costs 
in 
cost 
of 
sales 
in 
the 
same 
period 
last 
year 
(please 
refer 
to 
Note 
3 
to 
the 
 Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report). 

 SG A expenses 
 increased 37 
million to 
 1,707 million in 
the six-month 
period ended 
November 
24, 2024, 
compared to 
the same 
 period 
in fiscal 
2024, 
primarily 
driven 
by an 
increase 
in certain 
compensation 
and benefits 
expenses 
and 
the addition 
of 
a pet 
food 
 business in 
Europe. 
SG A expenses 
as a 
percent of 
net sales 
increased 30 
basis points 
in the 
six-month period 
ended November 
24, 
 2024, compared to the same period of fiscal 2024. 

 Restructuring, impairment, and 
other exit costs
 
totaled 3 million in 
the six-month period ended 
November 24, 2024, compared 
to 
 125 million in the same 
period last year. 
We recorded 
 3 million of charges 
related to actions previously 
announced in the six-month 
 period 
ended 
November 
24, 2024, 
compared 
to 8 
million 
in 
the 
same period 
last year. 
In 
fiscal 2024, 
we recorded 
a 117 
million 
 non-cash goodwill impairment charge 
related to our Latin America 
reporting unit (please refer 
to Note 3 to the 
Consolidated Financial 
 Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report). 

 Benefit plan non-service 
income
 
totaled 28 million 
in the six-month 
period ended November 
24, 2024, compared 
to 37 million 
in 
 the same period last year, primarily reflecting 
higher amortization of losses and interest costs. 
 Interest, net
 
for the six-month 
period ended November 
24, 2024, increased 
 13 million to 248 
million compared to 
the same period 
 of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by higher average long-term debt levels. 
 The 
 effective 
tax rate
 
for 
the six-month 
period ended 
November 
24, 2024, 
was 20.9 
percent compared 
to 20.0 
percent in 
the same 
 period 
last 
year. 
The 
0.9 
percentage 
point 
increase 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
certain 
nonrecurring 
discrete 
tax 
benefits 
in 
fiscal 
2024, 
 partially 
offset 
by 
favorable 
earnings 
mix 
by 
jurisdiction 
in 
fiscal 
2025. 
Our 
effective 
tax 
rate 
excluding 
certain 
items 
affecting 
 comparability was 
20.9 
percent in 
the six-month 
period ended 
November 24, 
2024, compared 
to 21.0 
percent in 
the same 
period last 

25 
 year 
(see

Measures 
section 
below 
for 
a

of 
our 
use 
of 
measures 
not

by

The 
0.1 
 percentage 
point 
decrease 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
favorable 
earnings 
mix 
by 
jurisdiction 
in 
fiscal 
2025, 
partially 
offset 
by 
certain 
 nonrecurring discrete tax benefits in fiscal 2024. 
 After-tax 
earnings from 
joint ventures
 
increased 
to 49 million 
for the 
six-month period 
ended November 
24, 2024, 
compared to 
 48 million in 
the same period 
in fiscal 2024, 
primarily due 
to lower 
input costs 
and favorable 
net price 
realization and 
mix at 
CPW, 
 partially 
offset 
by higher 
SG A expenses 
and 
a decrease 
in volume 
at CPW. 
On 
a constant 
-currency 
basis, after-tax 
earnings 
from 
 joint ventures increased 
5 percent (see

30 
 LIQUIDITY 
AND CAPITAL 
RESOURCES 
 During the 
six-month period 
ended November 
24, 2024, 
cash provided by 
operations was 
 1,775 million compared 
to 1,496 million 
 in the same period 
last year. 
The 279 million increase 
was primarily driven by 
a 338 million change 
in current assets and 
liabilities. 
 The 
 338 
million 
change 
in 
current 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
was 
primarily 
driven 
by 
a 
 596 
million 
change 
in 
the 
timing 
of 
accounts 
 payable, 
partially offset 
by a 
 183 million 
change in 
inventories due 
to higher 
inventory levels 
and a 
 126 
million change 
in prepaid 
 expenses and other current assets primarily driven by changes in certain 
marketable securities. 
 Cash used by 
investing activities during 
the six-month period 
ended November 24, 
2024, was 306 million 
compared to 316 million 
 for the same period in 
fiscal 2024. During the first 
quarter of fiscal 2025, 
we paid 8 million related 
to a purchase price holdback 
after 
 certain 
closing 
conditions 
were 
met 
for 
the 
acquisition 
of 
a 
pet 
food 
business 
in 
Europe 
in 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2024. 
In 
 addition, 
we spent 
 301 million 
on purchases 
of land, 
buildings, and 
equipment in 
the six-month 
period ended 
November 24, 
2024, 
 compared to 294 million in the same period last year. 
 Cash 
generated 
by 
financing 
activities 
during 
the 
six-month 
period 
ended 
November 
24, 
2024, 
was 
 422 
million 
compared 
to 
 1,174 million of 
cash used 
by financing 
activities in 
the same 
period in 
fiscal 2024. 
We 
had 1,754 
million of 
net debt issuances 
in 
 the six-month 
period ended 
November 24, 
2024, compared 
to 867 
million of 
net debt 
issuances in 
the same 
period a 
year ago. 
We 
 paid 600 million for purchases 
of common stock for 
treasury in the six-month period 
ended November 24, 2024, compared 
to 1,302 
 million in the 
same period in fiscal 
2024. 
In addition, we paid 
 676 million of dividends 
in the six-month period 
ended November 24, 
 2024, 
compared to 691 million in the same period last year. 
 As of 
November 
24, 
2024, we 
had 
 442 million 
of cash 
and cash 
equivalents 
in foreign 
jurisdictions. In 
anticipation 
of repatriating 
 funds 
from 
foreign 
jurisdictions, 
we 
record 
local 
country 
withholding 
taxes 
on 
our 
international 
earnings, 
as 
applicable. 
We 
may 
 repatriate our 
cash and 
cash equivalents 
held by 
our foreign 
subsidiaries without 
such funds 
being subject 
to further 
U.S. income 
tax 
 liability. Earnings 
prior to fiscal 2018 from our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently reinvested in 
those jurisdictions. 
 The following table details the fee-paid committed and uncommitted credit 
lines we had available as of November 24, 2024:

 To ensure availability 
of funds, we maintain bank credit lines and have commercial paper programs 
available to us in the United States 
 and Europe. 
 Certain 
of 
our 
long-term 
debt 
agreements, 
our 
credit 
facilities, 
and 
our 
noncontrolling 
interests 
contain 
restrictive 
covenants. 
As 
of 
 November 24, 2024, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. 

 We 
have 1,822 
million of 
long-term debt 
maturing in 
the next 
12 months 
that is 
classified as 
current, including 
 800 million 
of 4.0 
 percent fixed-rate notes 
due April 17, 
2025, 500 million 
of 0.125 percent 
fixed-rate notes due 
November 15, 
2025, and 500 
million 
 of 5.241 
percent fixed-rate 
notes due 
November 18, 
2025. We 
believe that 
cash flows 
from operations, 
together with 
available short- 
 and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity 
and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 The 
third-party 
holder 
of 
the 
General 
Mills 
Cereals, 
LLC 
(GMC) 
Class A 
Interests 
receives 
quarterly 
preferred 
distributions 
from 
 available net 
income based 
on the application 
of a 
floating preferred 
return rate 
to the 
holder s capital 
account balance 
established in 
 the most recent mark-to-market valuation 
(currently 252 million). On June 1, 2024, 
the floating preferred return rate on GMC s 
Class 
 A Interests was reset to the 
sum of the three-month Term 
SOFR plus 261 basis points. 
The preferred return rate is adjusted 
every three 
 years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder 
or through a remarketing auction. 

 We 
have an option 
to purchase the 
Class A Interests for 
consideration equal to 
the then current 
capital account value, 
plus any unpaid 
 preferred return 
and the 
prescribed make-whole 
amount. If 
we purchase 
these interests, 
any change 
in the 
third-party holder s 
capital 
 account 
from 
its 
original 
value 
will 
be 
charged 
directly 
to 
retained 
earnings 
and 
will 
increase 
or 
decrease 
the 
net 
earnings 
used 
to 
 calculate EPS in that period. 

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in 
our Annual Report on 
 Form 
10-K for 
the fiscal 
year ended 
May 26, 
2024. The 
accounting policies 
used in 
preparing our 
interim fiscal 
2025 Consolidated 

31 
 Financial Statements are the 
same as those described 
in our Form 10-K. 
Please see Note 1 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements 
in 
 Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.
 Our 
critical 
accounting 
estimates 
are 
those 
that 
have 
meaningful 
impact 
on 
the 
reporting 
of 
our 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
 operations. 
These estimates 
include 
our accounting 
for revenue 
recognition, 
valuation of 
long-lived 
assets, intangible 
assets, income 
 taxes, 
and 
defined 
benefit 
pension, 
other 
postretirement 
benefit, 
and 
postemployment 
benefit 
plans. 
The 
assumptions 
and 
 methodologies used 
in the 
determination of 
those estimates 
as of 
November 24, 
2024, are 
the same 
as those 
described in 
our Annual 
 Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2024. 
 Our 
annual 
goodwill 
and 
indefinite-lived 
intangible 
assets 
impairment 
test 
was 
performed 
on 
the 
first 
day 
of 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
 fiscal 
2025, 
and 
we 
determined 
there 
was 
no 
impairment 
of 
our 
intangible 
assets 
as 
their 
related 
fair 
values 
were 
substantially 
in 
 excess of the 
carrying values, 
except for 
the 
 Uncle Toby s
 
brand intangible 
asset. In addition, 
while having 
significant coverage 
as of 
 our 
fiscal 
2025 
assessment 
date, 
the 
 Progresso
 , 
 Nudges, 
True 
Chews, 
and 
Kitano
 
brand 
intangible 
assets 
had 
risk 
of 
decreasing 
 coverage. We will continue 
to monitor these businesses for potential impairment. 
 RECENTLY 
ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 In November 2024, the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) 
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 
2024-03 requiring 
 additional income 
statement disclosures. 
The ASU 
requires the 
disaggregation 
of specific 
categories of 
expenses underlying 
the line 
 items presented 
on the 
income statement. 
Additionally, 
the ASU 
requires enhanced 
disclosure of 
selling expenses. 
The requirements 
 of the ASU are effective for annual periods beginning 
after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years 
beginning after 
 December 
15, 
2027. 
For 
us, 
annual 
reporting 
requirements 
will 
be 
effective 
for 
our 
fiscal 
2028 
Form 
10-K 
and 
interim 
reporting 
 requirements will be 
effective beginning 
with our first 
quarter of fiscal 
2029. Early adoption 
is permitted and 
the amendments 
should 
 be applied on a prospective 
basis. Retrospective application is permitted. 
We are 
in the process of analyzing 
the impact of the ASU on 
 our related disclosures. 

 In March 2024, the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
issued final rules on the 
enhancement and standardization 
of climate-
 related disclosures. The rules require 
disclosure of, among other things: 
material climate-related risks; activities 
to mitigate or adapt 
to 
 such 
risks; 
governance 
and 
management 
of 
such 
risks; 
and 
material 
greenhouse 
gas 
(GHG) 
emissions 
from 
operations 
owned 
or 
 controlled 
(Scope 
1) 
and/or 
indirect 
emissions 
from 
purchased 
energy 
consumed 
in 
operations 
(Scope 
2). 
Additionally, 
the 
rules 
 require disclosure 
in the 
notes to 
the financial 
statements of 
the effects 
of severe 
weather events 
and other 
natural conditions, 
subject 
 to 
certain 
materiality 
thresholds. 
The 
SEC 
has 
issued 
a 
stay 
on 
the 
final 
rules 
due 
to 
litigation 
and 
the 
effective 
date 
is 
delayed 
 indefinitely. We 
are in the process of analyzing the impact of the rules on our disclosures. 
 In 
December 
2023, 
the 
FASB 
issued 
ASU 
2023-09 
requiring 
enhanced 
income 
tax 
disclosures. 
The 
ASU 
requires 
disclosure 
of 
 specific 
categories 
and 
disaggregation 
of 
information 
in 
the 
rate 
reconciliation 
table. 
The 
ASU 
also 
requires 
disclosure 
of 
 disaggregated 
information 
related 
to 
income 
taxes 
paid, 
income 
or 
loss 
from 
continuing 
operations 
before 
income 
tax 
expense 
or 
 benefit, and 
income tax 
expense or benefit 
from continuing 
operations. The 
requirements of 
the ASU are 
effective for 
annual periods 
 beginning after December 15, 2024, 
which for us is fiscal 2026. 
Early adoption is permitted 
and the amendments should be 
applied on 
 a prospective 
basis. Retrospective 
application is 
permitted. We 
are in 
the process 
of analyzing 
the impact 
of the 
ASU on 
our related 
 disclosures. 
 In 
November 
2023, 
the 
FASB 
issued 
ASU 
2023-07 
requiring 
enhanced 
segment 
disclosures. 
The 
ASU 
requires 
disclosure 
of 
 significant 
segment 
expenses 
regularly 
provided 
to 
the 
chief 
operating 
decision 
maker 
(CODM) 
included 
within 
segment 
operating 
 profit 
or 
loss. 
Additionally, 
the 
ASU 
requires 
a 
description 
of 
how 
the 
CODM 
utilizes 
segment 
operating 
profit 
or 
loss 
to 
assess 
 segment performance. 
The requirements 
of the 
ASU are effective 
for annual 
periods beginning 
after December 
15, 2023, 
and interim 
 periods within 
fiscal years 
beginning after 
December 15, 
2024. For 
us, annual 
reporting requirements 
will be 
effective for 
our fiscal 
 2025 Form 10-K 
and interim reporting requirements 
will be effective 
beginning with our first 
quarter of fiscal 
2026. Early adoption 
is 
 permitted and retrospective application 
is required for all 
periods presented. We 
are in the process 
of analyzing the impact 
of the ASU 
 on our related disclosures.

 NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 We 
have 
included 
in 
this 
report 
measures 
of 
financial 
performance 
that 
are not 
defined 
by 
GAAP. 
We 
believe 
that 
these 
measures 
 provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other 
communications to investors. 
 For each 
of these 
non-GAAP financial 
measures, we 
are providing 
below a 
reconciliation of 
the differences 
between the 
non-GAAP 
 measure and the most 
directly comparable GAAP measure, 
an explanation of why 
we believe the non-GAAP 
measure provides useful 
 information to 
investors, and 
any additional 
material purposes 
for which 
our management 
or Board 
of Directors 
uses the 
non-GAAP 
 measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not 
in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. 
 Significant Items Impacting Comparability 
 Several 
measures 
below 
are 
presented 
on 
an 
adjusted 
basis. 
The 
adjustments 
are 
either 
items 
resulting 
from 
infrequently 
occurring 
 events or items that, in management s 
judgment, significantly affect the year-to-year 
assessment of operating results. 

 The following are descriptions of significant items impacting comparability 
of our results.

sales and 
segment net 
sales. This 
measure is 
used in 
reporting to 
 our 
Board 
of 
Directors 
and 
executive 
management 
and 
as 
a 
component 
of 
the 
measurement 
of 
our 
performance 
for 
incentive 
 compensation purposes. 
We 
believe that 
organic net 
sales growth 
rates provide 
useful information 
to investors 
because they 
provide 
 transparency 
to 
underlying 
performance 
in 
our 
net

by 
excluding 
the 
effect 
that 
foreign 
currency 
exchange 
rate 
fluctuations, 
 acquisitions, divestitures, 
and a 53

week, when applicable, 
have on year-to-year comparability. 
A reconciliation of 
these measures to 
 reported net 
sales growth 
rates, the 
relevant GAAP 
measures, are 
included in 
our Consolidated 
Results of 
Operations and 
Results of 
 Segment Operations discussions in the MD A above.

 Adjusted Operating Profit and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate 
 This measure is used in reporting 
to our Board of Directors and 
executive management and as a 
component of the measurement of 
our 
 performance for 
incentive compensation purposes. 
We 
believe that 
this measure provides 
useful information 
to investors because 
it is

operating 
profit 
measure 
we 
use 
to 
evaluate 
operating 
profit 
performance 
on 
a 
comparable 
year-to-year 
basis. 
Additionally, 
the

by 
excluding 
the

constant foreign 
currency exchange 
rates based 
on the 
 rates 
in

To 
present 
this 
information, 
current 
period 
results 
for 
entities 
reporting 
in 
 currencies other 
than United 
States dollars 
are translated 
into United 
States dollars 
at the 
average exchange 
rates in 
effect during 
the 
 corresponding 
period 
of 
the 
prior 
fiscal 
year, 
rather 
than 
the 
actual 
average 
exchange 
rates 
in 
effect 
during 
the 
current 
fiscal 
year. 
 Therefore, 
the 
foreign 
currency 
impact 
is 
equal 
to 
current 
year 
results 
in 
local

multiplied 
by 
the

in 
the

hierarchy. 
 For purposes 
of fair 
value measurement, 
we categorize 
assets and 
liabilities into 
one of 
three levels 
based on 
 the assumptions 
(inputs) used 
in valuing 
the asset or 
liability. 
Level 1 provides 
the most reliable 
measure of 
fair value, while 
Level 3 
 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are 
defined as follows: 

 Level 1: 
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2: 
Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in 
Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in 
 active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets. 
 Level 3: 
Unobservable inputs reflecting management s 
assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability. 
 Free cash flow.

 changes in 
the hedged 
item in 
the same 
reporting period. 
Hedge accounting 
is permitted 
for certain 
hedging instruments 
and hedged 
 items 
only 
if 
the 
hedging 
relationship 
is 
highly 
effective, 
and

the 
date 
a 
hedging 
relationship 
is

 Item 4. 
Controls and Procedures. 

We, 
under the 
supervision and 
with the 
participation of 
our management, 
including our 
Chief Executive 
Officer and 
Chief Financial 
 Officer, 
have 
evaluated 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the design 
and 
operation 
of 
our 
disclosure 
controls 
and 
procedures 
(as 
defined 
in 
Rule 
 13a-15(e) 
under 
the 
Securities 
Exchange 
Act 
of 
1934). 
Based 
on 
our 
evaluation, 
our 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
and 
Chief 
Financial 
 Officer 
have 
concluded 
that, 
as 
of 
November 
24, 
2024, 
our 
disclosure 
controls 
and 
procedures 
were 
effective 
to 
ensure 
that 
 information required to 
be disclosed by us 
in reports that we 
file or submit under 
the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 is (1) 
recorded, 
 processed, summarized, 
and reported 
within the 
time periods 
specified in 
Securities and 
Exchange Commission 
rules and 
forms, and 
 (2) 
accumulated 
and 
communicated 
to 
our 
management, 
including 
our 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
and 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer, 
in 
a 
 manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There were no changes in our internal 
control over financial reporting (as defined 
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange 
Act 
 of 
1934) 
during 
the 
quarter 
ended 
November 
24, 
2024, 
that 
materially 
affected, 
or 
are 
reasonably 
likely 
to 
materially 
affect,

 internal control over financial reporting.
