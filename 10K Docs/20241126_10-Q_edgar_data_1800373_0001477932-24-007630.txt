These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Use of estimates Start-Up Costs Cash 8 Table of Contents Income Taxes Fair Value Measurements -year lease for corporate office which requires monthly payments of .25, payable at the beginning of each monthly rental period. The lease is classified as an operating lease as the lease does not transfer ownership of the underlying asset at the end of the lease term, there is no purchase option, the lease terms is not for the major part of the remaining economic life of the asset, and the present value of future lease payments does not exceed substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. Accordingly, at commencement, the Company recognized a right of use asset and a lease liability based upon the present value of lease payments not yet paid, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at lease commencement. The company classifies the right-of-use asset as non-current for the entire lease term. The company classifies the portion of the liability due within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer, with current liability, and the rest with noncurrent liability. The interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable and management estimated its incremental borrowing rate to be by referencing the information from the current lending market and the costs of borrowing disclosed by some guideline public companies. On December 31, 2022, the company reached an agreement with the lessor to terminate the lease. No early termination fee was charged. Undiscounted cash flows on an annual basis related to this lease was by December 31, 2022. from Australian Trefoil Heath Technology, which is owned by Li, Yang, the Treasurer of the Company.

In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. common shares with a par value of per share.

The following information should be read in conjunction with (i) the financial statements of Goldenwell Biotech, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Company ), and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q together with (ii) the more detailed business information and the December 31, 2023 audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Form 10-K (File No. 000-56275; the Form 10-K ), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 12, 2024. Statements in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute forward-looking statements. OVERVIEW The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 20, 2019, and established a fiscal year end of December 31. Going Concern To date the Company has little operations or revenues and consequently has incurred recurring losses from operations. Substantially greater revenues are not anticipated until we complete the financing we endeavor to obtain, as described in this Form 10-K, and implement our initial business plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund our business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our activities have been financed from the proceeds of share subscriptions. On August 20, 2019 the Company sold 41,000,000 shares of common stock to its founders for a subscription amount of 41,000. On August 20, 2019, the Company sold 39,000,000 shares of common stock for a subscription amount of 215,504. At September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding related-party loan of 95,558 and an unrelated party loan of 119,250. The Company plans to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise any capital through this or any other offerings. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP ). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results: Basis of Accounting The Company s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting and are presented in United States Dollars. 11 Table of Contents Basic Earnings (loss) per Share The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock. Basic net earnings (loss) per share amounts are computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the limited level of operations, the Company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the Company is a going concern. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes . A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Foreign Currency Translation The Company s functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. Occasional transactions may occur in Chinese Renminbi or Australian Dollars. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Average monthly rates are used to translate expenses. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of net income (loss). Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of cash and current liabilities approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Unless otherwise noted, it is management s opinion the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. Start-Up expenses As a start-up company, the costs associated with start-up activities are expensed as incurred. Accordingly, start-up costs associated with the Company s formation have been included in the Company s general and administrative expenses. 12 Table of Contents Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Major repairs and betterments are capitalized and normal maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Upon retirement or sale of an asset, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. PLAN OF OPERATION We are an early stage corporation and have generated revenues of 0 and only 297 from sales of our nutraceutical and dietary supplements business during the three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2024. Accordingly, our plan of operation for the 12 months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is to increase the sales of our products. The Company believes it can satisfy its cash requirements through the fiscal year end of December 31, 2024, from its cash of 4,755 as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital balance of (19,239). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023: We recorded revenues of 0 and 382, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 23,065 as compared to 35,406 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in stock issuance expense. We recorded net losses of 23,065 and 35,406, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024: We recorded revenues of 297 and 2,080, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 104,111 as compared to 97,131 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to increases in interest and accounting and auditing expenses. We recorded net losses of 103,962 and 96,096, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources At September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 4,755 and total current liabilities of 1,198, consisting of unearned revenue. Our working capital balance at September 30, 2024, was (19,239). We sufficient cash on hand to fund our ongoing operational expenses through December 31, 2024. Material hurdles remain until we can increase sales of our products. First, we must construct manufacturing facilities, which includes locating a site, installing a workshop and setting up equipment. No special equipment needs to be engineered or produced. All needed equipment is presently available from existing manufacturers. Second, our workforce will need to be trained, however, no specialized education or experience is needed by labor we intend to hire. We estimate that we need approximately 5,000,000 to complete such activities and that it would take approximately one year to complete such activities. Additional funding will likely come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock, if we are able to sell such stock. If we are successful in completing an equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company. We do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our activities. In the absence of such financing, our business will fail. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue the expansion of our business. 13 Table of Contents At September 30, 2024, our total assets were 179,432 consisting of cash of 4,755, and inventory of 174,677. At September 30, 2024, our total liabilities were 198,671 and stockholders equity was (19,239). Cash Flows from Operating Activities We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. Net cash used in operations was 23,065 and 35,210 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and 104,026 and 94,077 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows provided by financing activities was 2,100 and 30,000, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and 55,550 and 60,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off-balance sheet arrangements for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Subsequent Events None through date of this filing. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. As a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item 3. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (who acts as our principal executive officer) and our Secretary (who acts as our principal accounting officer and principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Secretary concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules, regulations and forms, and (ii) that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and our Secretary, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Secretary, has concluded there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during this quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 14 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. The Company is not currently subject to any legal proceedings. From time to time, the Company may become subject to litigation or proceedings in connection with its business, as either a plaintiff or defendant. There are no such pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party that, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations.
