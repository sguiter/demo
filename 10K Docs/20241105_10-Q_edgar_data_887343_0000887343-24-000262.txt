 billion of goodwill and million of other intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired, net of fair value of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were million and million in merger-related expenses, respectively, compared to million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Additional merger-related expenses will be expensed in future periods as incurred. 
 
 The following table presents unaudited pro forma information as if the Merger had occurred on January 1, 2022, which was the beginning of the last full fiscal year completed prior to the date of the Merger. The pro forma adjustments give effect to any change in interest income due to the accretion of the discount (premium) associated with the fair value adjustments to acquired loans and leases, any change in interest expense due to estimated premium amortization/discount accretion associated with the fair value adjustment to acquired interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt and the amortization of the core deposit intangible that would have resulted had the deposits been acquired as of January 1, 2022. The pro forma information is not indicative of what would have occurred had the Merger occurred as of the beginning of the year prior to the Merger Date. The pro forma amounts below do not reflect the Company's expectations as of the date of the pro forma information of further operating cost savings and other business synergies expected to be achieved, including revenue growth as a result of the Merger. As a result, actual amounts differed from the unaudited pro forma information presented.

 The number of individual debt securities in an unrealized loss position in the tables above decreased to as of September 30, 2024, as compared to at December 31, 2023. These unrealized losses on the debt securities held by the Company were caused by changes in market interest rates or the widening of market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of these securities and are not due to the underlying credit of the issuers. Management monitors the published credit ratings of the issuers of the debt securities for material rating or outlook changes. As the decline in fair value of the debt securities is attributable to changes in interest rates or widening market spreads and not credit quality, these investments do not have an ACL as of September 30, 2024.

 The forecasted average federal funds rate is expected to be in 2024, in 2025, in 2026 and in 2027. 
 
 The Bank uses an additional scenario that differs in terms of severity, both favorable or unfavorable, to assess the sensitivity in the ACL results and to inform qualitative adjustments. The economic variables are consistent between scenarios. The Bank selected the Moody's Analytics' August 2024 S2 scenario for this analysis. In the scenario selected, there is a probability that the economy will perform better, broadly speaking, and a probability that it will perform worse; and the scenario includes the following variables: 
 
 U.S. real GDP average annualized growth of in 2024, - in 2025, in 2026, and in 2027; 
 U.S. unemployment rate average of in 2024, in 2025, in 2026, and in 2027; and 
 The forecasted average federal funds rate is expected to be in 2024, in 2025, in 2026 and in 2027. 
 
 The results using the comparison scenario as well as changes to the macroeconomic variables subsequent to selected economic forecast scenarios for sensitivity analysis were reviewed by management and were considered when evaluating the qualitative factor adjustments.

 to , where a higher rating represents higher risk. For non-homogeneous loans and leases, PD ratings of through are "pass" grades, while PD ratings of and are "watch" grades. PD ratings of 12-16 correspond to the regulatory-defined categories of special mention ), substandard - ), doubtful ), and loss ). The loss given default scale measures the amount of loss that may not be recovered in the event of a default, using six alphabetic ratings from A-F, where a higher rating represents higher risk. The LGD scale quantifies recovery risk associated with an event of default and predicts the amount of loss that would be incurred on a loan or lease if a borrower were to experience a major default and includes variables that may be external to the borrower, such as industry, geographic location, and credit cycle stage. It could also include variables specific to the loan or lease, including collateral valuation, covenant structure and debt type. The product of the borrower's PD and a loan or lease LGD is the loan or lease expected loss, expressed as a percentage. This provides a common language of credit risk across different loans. 
 
 The PD scale estimates the likelihood that a borrower will experience a major default on any of its debt obligations within a specified time period. Examples of major defaults include payments days or more past due, non-accrual classification, bankruptcy filing, or a full or partial charge-off of a loan or lease. As such, the PD scale represents the credit quality indicator for non-homogeneous loans and leases. 
 
 The credit quality indicator rating categories follow regulatory classification and can be generally described by the following groupings for loans and leases: 
 
 Pass/Watch A pass loan or lease is a loan or lease with a credit risk level acceptable to the Bank for extending credit and maintaining normal credit monitoring. A watch loan or lease is considered pass rated but has a heightened level of unacceptable default risk due to an emerging risk element or declining performance trend. Watch ratings are expected to be temporary, with issues resolved or manifested to the extent that a higher or lower risk rating would be appropriate within a short period of time. 
 
 Special Mention A special mention loan or lease has potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution's credit position at some future date. These borrowers have an elevated probability of default but not to the point of a substandard classification. 
 
 Substandard A substandard loan or lease is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans and leases classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful Loans or leases classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 Loss Loans or leases classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted.

 Forward sales commitments Commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale Standby letters of credit 
 
 The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet credit risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees. These instruments involve elements of credit and interest-rate risk similar to the risk involved in on-balance sheet items. The contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the Bank's involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. 
 
 The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees written, is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. 

financial guarantees in connection with standby letters of credit that the Bank was required to perform on during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, approximately million of standby letters of credit expire within one year, and million expire thereafter.

 related entities (the iCap Entities that maintained their primary deposit accounts with the Bank filed jointly-administered Chapter 11 bankruptcies in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Washington. The Bank was served with a request for production of account records and produced such records through counsel. Concurrently, in pleadings filed in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Washington on behalf of investors who claimed losses of approximately million, the Bank was identified as a party against which claims may be brought in connection with the iCap Entities alleged operation of Ponzi schemes prior to the bankruptcy proceedings described above. The potential claims against the Bank and the amount of any alleged damages have not been identified. To the extent suits or actions are commenced, the Bank intends to vigorously defend any and all claims. 
 
 In August 2020, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court (ND Cal) alleging aiding and abetting claims against the Bank associated with the failure of two commercial real estate investment companies, Professional Financial Investors, Inc. and Professional Investors Security Fund, Inc., allegedly effected through a Ponzi scheme. Both companies maintained their primary deposit account relationship with the Bank s Novato, Marin County, California branch office, acquired by the Bank from Circle Bank. The Bank's motion to dismiss was denied in January 2021, and its motion for summary judgment was denied in December 2022, and at the same time the District Court certified the plaintiffs proposed class. Two other related cases were filed in 2023: one case alleges similar claims by two investors and was filed in May 2023 in Marin County Superior Court; and another case was filed in June 2023 in the United States District Court (ND Cal) alleging claims by ten investors with different investments than the class members. The case filed in June 2023 was dismissed in July 2024 due to the plaintiffs' lack of standing. Plaintiffs in the District Court class action case allege damages resulting from the scheme of between million and million, which includes prejudgment interest and does not account for prior bankruptcy recoveries of approximately million to date. The Superior Court case does not yet have a clear estimate of damages. Trial in the District Court class action case is anticipated to begin in February 2025. Filing of these cases follows an SEC non-public investigation of Professional Financial Investors, Inc. and Professional Investors Security Fund, Inc. that commenced on May 28, 2020. The Bank intends to defend these matters vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses. 
 
 As previously disclosed, in 2023, the Bank was informed by one of its technology service providers (the "Vendor") that a widely reported security incident involving MOVEit, a filesharing software used globally by government agencies, enterprise corporations, and financial institutions, resulted in the unauthorized acquisition by a third party of the names and social security numbers or tax identification numbers of certain of the Bank s consumer and small business customers (the "Vendor Incident"). 
 
 Other than the information described above, no account information for accounts at the Bank was compromised as a result of the Vendor Incident, and no information from the Bank s commercial customers was involved in the Vendor Incident. On June 22, 2023, the Bank sent an email to potentially affected consumer and small business customers informing them of the Vendor Incident. Between August 11, 2023, and August 15, 2023, the Vendor, on behalf of the Bank, initiated formal notice via U.S. Mail to the 429,252 Bank customers whose information was involved in the Vendor Incident. The Bank and the Vendor also notified applicable federal and state regulators regarding the Vendor Incident. 
 
 Beginning on August 18, 2023, some of the individuals who were notified of the Vendor Incident filed lawsuits against the Bank seeking monetary recovery and other relief on behalf of themselves and one or more putative classes of other individuals similarly situated. Two such cases were filed in federal court (the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington), one of which was later voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Five such cases were filed in state court in Washington (the Washington Superior Court for Pierce County) and one case in state court in California (the California Superior Court for Contra Costa County). The state court cases were subsequently removed to federal court by the Bank. On October 4, 2023, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, in view of the large number of lawsuits arising out of the MOVEit data incident in federal courts across the United States, initiated a multidistrict litigation MDL for these cases to allow such cases to be transferred to one court for pre-trial proceedings. The MDL is titled In Re: MOVEit Customer Data Security Breach Litigation , MDL No. 3083 and is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts as MDL No. 1:23-md-03083-ADB-PGL. All seven cases against the Bank have been transferred to the MDL as of January 29, 2024. The cases collectively allege claims for negligence, negligence per se , breach of contract, breach of implied contract, breach of third-party beneficiary contract, breach of fiduciary duty, invasion of privacy, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment and violation of certain statutes, namely the Washington Consumer Protection Act, the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the California Unfair Competition Law. The Bank has also received claims by or on behalf of individuals in connection with the Vendor Incident. Such claims have the potential to give rise to additional litigation. The Bank has engaged defense counsel and intends to vigorously defend against these suits and any similar or related suits or claims. The Bank has notified relevant insurance carriers and business counterparties and continues to reserve all of its relevant rights to indemnity, defense, contribution, and other relief in connection with these matters.

 million accrued related to legal matters as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The resolution and the outcome of legal claims are unpredictable, exacerbated by factors including the following: damages sought are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; it is unclear whether a case brought as a class action will be allowed to proceed on that basis; discovery or motion practice is not complete; the proceeding is not yet in its final stages; the matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; there are a large number of parties, including multiple defendants; or there is a wide range of potential results. Any estimate or determination relating to the future resolution of legal and regulatory matters is uncertain and involves significant judgment. The Company is usually unable to determine whether a favorable or unfavorable outcome is remote, reasonably likely or probable, or to estimate the amount or range of a probable or reasonably likely loss until relatively late in the process. 
 
 Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of a specific legal matter, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against us in our currently outstanding legal matters, and the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. The Company will consider settlement of legal matters when, in management's judgment, it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
 
 Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, the Company believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against us will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to the Company's results of operations for any particular reporting period. 
 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk The Bank grants real estate mortgage, real estate construction, commercial, agricultural and installment loans and leases to customers in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. In management's judgment, a concentration exists in real estate-related loans, which represented approximately of the Bank's loan and lease portfolio for both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate concentrations are managed to ensure geographic and business diversity, primarily in our footprint. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the multifamily portfolio, including construction, represented approximately of the total loan portfolio. The office portfolio represented approximately of the total loan portfolio as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Although management believes such concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability, a substantial decline in the economy in general, material increases in interest rates, changes in tax policies, tightening credit or refinancing markets, or a decline in real estate values in the Bank's primary market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans. Personal and business incomes, proceeds from the sale of real property, or proceeds from refinancing represent the primary sources of repayment for a majority of these loans. 
 
 The Bank recognizes the credit risks inherent in dealing with other depository institutions. Accordingly, to prevent excessive exposure to any single correspondent, the Bank has established general standards for selecting correspondent banks as well as internal limits for allowable exposure to any single correspondent. In addition, the Bank has an investment policy that sets forth limitations that apply to all investments with respect to credit rating and concentrations with an issuer.

 counterparty default losses on forward contracts in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Market risk with respect to forward contracts arises principally from changes in the value of contractual positions due to changes in interest rates. The Bank limits its exposure to market risk by monitoring differences between commitments to customers and forward contracts with broker-dealers. In the event the Company has forward delivery contract commitments in excess of available mortgage loans, the Company completes the transaction by either paying or receiving a fee to or from the broker-dealer equal to the increase or decrease in the market value of the forward contract. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had commitments to originate mortgage loans held for sale totaling million and million, respectively, and forward sales commitments of million and million, respectively, which are used to hedge both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. 
 
 The Bank purchases interest rate futures and forward settling mortgage-backed securities to hedge the interest rate risk of MSRs. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had million notional of interest rate futures contracts and million of mortgage-backed securities related to this program. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had million notional of interest rate futures contracts and million of mortgage-backed securities related to this program. 
 
 The Bank executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting the interest rate swaps that the Bank executes with a third party, such that the Bank minimizes its net risk exposure. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had interest rate swap assets with a notional amount of billion and interest rate swap liabilities with a notional amount of billion related to this program. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had interest rate swap assets and interest rate swap liabilities, both with a notional amount of billion related to this program. 
 
 The Bank has collateral posting requirements for initial margins with its clearing members and clearing houses and is required to post collateral against its obligations under these agreements of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Bank's clearable interest rate swap derivatives are cleared through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and London Clearing House. These clearing houses characterize the variation margin payments, for certain derivative contracts that are referred to as settled-to-market, as settlements of the derivative's mark-to-market exposure and not collateral. The Company accounts for the variation margin as an adjustment to cash collateral, as well as a corresponding adjustment to the derivative asset and liability. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the variation margin netting adjustments for centrally cleared interest rate swaps consisted of derivative asset adjustments of million and million, respectively. 
 
 The Bank also has solely executed swaps indexed to Term SOFR, which are not clearable. These swaps are executed on a bilateral basis with a counterparty bank. There is no initial margin posted for bilateral swaps, but cash collateral equivalent to variation margin is exchanged to cover the mark-to-market exposure on a daily basis. 
 
 The Bank also executes foreign currency hedges as a service for customers. These foreign currency hedges are then offset with hedges with other third-party banks to limit the Bank's risk exposure. 
 
 The Bank's derivative assets are included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, while the derivative liabilities are included in other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument that is carried at fair value in the tables above: 
 
 Securities Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as matrix or model pricing, or broker indicative bids, when market quotes are not readily accessible or available. Management periodically reviews the pricing information received from the third-party pricing service and compares it to a secondary pricing service, evaluating significant price variances between services to determine an appropriate estimate of fair value to report. 
 
 Loans Held for Sale Fair value for residential mortgage loans originated as held for sale is determined based on quoted secondary market prices for similar loans, including the implicit fair value of embedded servicing rights. For loans not originated as held for sale, these loans are accounted for at lower of cost or market, with the fair value estimated based on the expected sales price. 
 
 Loans and leases Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, including commercial, real estate and consumer loans. Each loan category is further segregated by fixed and adjustable-rate loans. The fair value of loans is calculated by discounting expected cash flows at rates at which similar loans are currently being made. This model is periodically validated by an independent model validation group. These amounts are discounted further by embedded probable losses expected to be realized in the portfolio. For loans originated as held for sale and transferred into loans held for investment, the fair value is determined based on quoted secondary market prices for similar loans.

Generally, increases in the constant prepayment rate or the discount rate utilized in the fair value measurement of the residential mortgage servicing rights will result in a decrease in fair value. Conversely, decreases in the constant prepayment rate or the discount rate will result in an increase in fair value. 
 
 An increase in the pull-through rate utilized in the fair value measurement of the interest rate lock commitment derivative will result in an increase in the fair value measurement. Conversely, a decrease in the pull-through rate will result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. 
 
 Management believes that the credit risk adjusted spread utilized in the fair value measurement of the junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value is indicative of the non-performance risk premium a willing market participant would require under current market conditions, which is an inactive market. Generally, an increase in the credit spread will result in a decrease in the estimated fair value. Conversely, a decrease in the credit spread will result in an increase in the estimated fair value.

Comparatively, unrealized losses of million and million were recorded net of tax as other comprehensive losses of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The change recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by movements in the spot curve and forward rates. The change recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to increases in credit spreads, partially offset by modest changes in the swap rates. 
 
 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 From time to time, certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These adjustments to fair value generally result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets due to impairment, typically on collateral-dependent loans.

 Total losses from nonrecurring measurements 
 
 The following provides a description of the valuation technique and inputs for the Company's assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 and measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Unobservable inputs and qualitative information about the unobservable inputs are not presented as the fair value is determined by third-party information for loans and leases. 
 
 The loans and leases amounts above represent collateral-dependent loans and leases that have been adjusted to fair value. When a loan or non-homogeneous lease is identified as collateral-dependent, the Bank measures the impairment using the current fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs. Depending on the characteristics of a loan or lease, the fair value of collateral is generally estimated by obtaining external appraisals, but in some cases the value of the collateral may be estimated as having little to no value. When a homogeneous lease or equipment finance agreement becomes 181 days past due, it is determined that the collateral has little to no value. If it is determined that the value of the collateral-dependent loan or lease is less than its recorded investment, the Bank recognizes this impairment and adjusts the carrying value of the loan or lease to fair value, less costs to sell, through the ACL. The loss represents charge-offs on collateral-dependent loans and leases for fair value adjustments based on the fair value of collateral.

 Loans ) ) 
 
 The Bank elected to measure certain residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option, with interest income on these loans held for sale reported in interest and fees on loans and leases on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. This reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. Residential mortgage loans held for sale accounted for under the fair value option are measured initially at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Gains and losses from such changes in fair value are reported as a component of residential mortgage banking revenue. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net increases in fair value of and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded net decreases in fair value of and million, respectively. 
 
 Management's intent to sell certain residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale may change over time due to factors including changes in overall market liquidity or changes in characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. Consequently, these loans may be reclassified as loans held for investment and maintained in the Bank's loan portfolio. In the event that loans currently classified as held for sale are reclassified as loans held for investment, the loans will continue to be measured at fair value. Gains and losses from changes in fair value for these loans are reported in earnings as a component of other income and interest income on these loans are reported in interest and fees on loans and leases on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net increase in fair value of million and a net decrease in fair value of million, respectively, as compared to net decreases in fair value of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company selected the fair value measurement option for certain junior subordinated debentures originally issued by UHC prior to the Merger (the Umpqua Statutory Trusts) and for junior subordinated debentures acquired by UHC from Sterling Financial Corporation prior to the Merger, with changes in fair value recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. The remaining junior subordinated debentures were acquired through business combinations and were measured at fair value at the time of acquisition and subsequently measured at amortized cost.

 Executive Overview 
 
 The following is a discussion of our results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the applicable prior periods. 
 
 Financial Performance 
 
 Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 
 
 Earnings per diluted common share was 0.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.57 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by an increase in non-interest income due to quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity and a favorable change in non-interest expense due to the prior quarter including 12.0 million in restructuring expenses. Net interest income increased due to higher income earned on loans. 
 
 Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.56 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, unchanged from the three months ended June 30, 2024. A favorable balance sheet funding mix shift into lower-cost deposits and a slight increase in loan yields offset a lower yield on securities, contributing to margin stability between periods. 
 
 Non-interest income was 66.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 44.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was driven by fluctuations in fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity due to rate changes, which collectively resulted in a net fair value gain of 6.6 million in the third quarter compared to a net fair value loss of 9.7 million in the second quarter. 
 
 Non-interest expense was 271.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 279.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease is mainly due to a decrease in restructuring expenses, partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits, as prior quarter's expense was reduced by a 7.7 million reversal of a compensation-related accrual. Due to staff reductions that took place in the second quarter, salaries and wages were down by 5.7 million in the third quarter related to the enterprise-wide evaluation of our operations, which resulted in consolidated positions and simplified reporting and organizational structures, which partially offset the impact of the second quarter's accrual reversal that did not repeat in the current quarter. 
 
 Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 
 
 Earnings per diluted common share was 1.87 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.33 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was primarily driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses, due to the initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Non-interest expense also decreased, primarily due to lower expenses related to the Merger. These favorable changes were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income due to higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher average yields on interest-earning assets. 
 
 Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was due to higher funding costs that reflect deposit repricing and a shift in product mix. Net interest income decreased 58.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher average yields on interest-earning assets and higher average balances due to the Merger. 
 
 Non-interest income was 161.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 138.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was partially due to fluctuations in fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity, which collectively resulted in a favorable change due to a net fair value loss of 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net fair value loss of 23.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, there were increases in most categories, largely due to the impact of nine months as a combined company compared to only seven months as a combined company for the prior year period, as well as increasing fee-generating product traction with our customer base.

 Non-interest expense was 838.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 975.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects a decrease in merger and restructuring expenses of 143.0 million and a decrease in salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets added in connection with the Merger, largely due to the impact of nine months as a combined company in the current period, compared to only seven months as a combined company for the prior year period. 
 
 Comparison of current period end to prior year end 
 
 Total loans and leases were 37.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 61.1 million, as compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total loans and leases was primarily in the commercial real estate and commercial loan balances, partially offset by a decrease in residential balances. The increase was driven by commercial line utilization and new originations, partially offset by loan payoffs. Balances were also impacted by a decline in transactional real estate loans, which trended lower as we organically remix the portfolio into relationship-driven commercial loans. 
 
 Total deposits were 41.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 92.3 million, as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to a reduction in brokered deposits, partially offset by customer deposit growth, largely in commercial customer balances, driven by focused campaigns run by our branch network. 
 
 Total consolidated assets were 51.9 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 52.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Credit Quality 
 
 Non-performing assets increased to 167.6 million, or 0.32 of total assets, as of September 30, 2024, compared to 113.9 million, or 0.22 of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. Non-performing loans and leases were 165.2 million, or 0.44 of total loans and leases, as of September 30, 2024, compared to 112.9 million, or 0.30 of total loans and leases, as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, non-performing loans included 65.8 million in government guarantees. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses was 438.3 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 25.8 million compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was due to changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models and a recalibration in the first quarter of 2024 of our CECL calculation for non-homogeneous commercial loans and leases and residential development loans. 
 
 The Company had a provision for credit losses of 28.8 million and 77.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. This compares to a provision for credit losses of 31.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 158.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior quarter was mainly due to credit migration trends and changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 included an 88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans related to the Merger. This initial provision, as well as changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models and a recalibration of our CECL calculation in the first quarter of 2024, contributed to the change when compared to the same period in the current year. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Total cash and cash equivalents were 2.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 51.5 million from December 31, 2023. The Company manages its cash position as part of management's strategy to maintain a high-quality liquid asset position to support balance sheet flexibility, fund growth in lending and investment portfolios, and deleverage the balance sheet by decreasing debt and non-deposit liabilities as economic conditions permit. 
 
 Including secured off-balance sheet lines of credit, total available liquidity was 19.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, representing 37 of total assets, 47 of total deposits, and 138 of estimated uninsured deposits.

 Capital 
 
 The Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 12.5 and its common equity tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio was 10.3 as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 11.9 and its CET1 capital ratio was 9.6 . 
 
 Columbia paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.36 per common share to shareholders on September 9, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our critical accounting estimates are described in detail in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and follow general practices within the financial services industry, in which the Company operates. This preparation requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions, and judgments reflected in the financial statements. Certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Management believes that the estimates for ACL, business combinations, and goodwill are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. There have been no material changes in the methodology of these estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Columbia's financial results for any periods ended prior to February 28, 2023, the Merger Date, reflect UHC results only on a standalone basis. Accordingly, Columbia's reported financial results for the first quarter of 2023 reflect only UHC financial results through the closing of the Merger. As a result of these two factors, Columbia's financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods. 
 
 Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 
 
 The Company had net income of 146.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 120.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in net income was mainly attributable to increases in non-interest income and net interest income as well as decreases in non-interest expense and provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes. The increase of 21.5 million in non-interest income was primarily driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and MSR hedging activity driven by changes in interest rates. The increase of 2.8 million in net interest income reflects higher income earned on loans, which occurred despite a reduction in purchase accounting accretion income, and relatively stable funding costs prior to the late-quarter decline in the federal funds rate. The decrease of 7.9 million in non-interest expense was mainly due to a decrease in merger and restructuring expense driven by 12.0 million in restructuring expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The restructuring expense was due to an enterprise-wide evaluation of our operations during the first quarter of 2024, which resulted in consolidated positions and simplified reporting and organizational structures, with changes carried out primarily in the second quarter. The decrease of 3.1 million in provision for credit losses reflects credit migration trends and changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models.

 Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net income of 390.4 million, compared to net income of 255.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income was mainly attributable to decreases in non-interest expense and provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income. The 137.4 million decrease in non-interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in merger and restructuring expenses, as the bulk of the merger expenses associated with the Merger were recognized in 2023. The decrease of 80.6 million in provision for credit losses was impacted by the initial provision of 88.4 million for historical Columbia non-PCD loans that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease of 58.5 million in net interest income was due to higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher average yields on interest-earning assets and a larger average balance sheet for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company paid off 250.0 million in BTFP borrowings during the third quarter to continue to rebalance our funding sources in support of our liquidity management program and lower the cost of liabilities. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company conducted an enterprise-wide evaluation of our operations, which resulted in consolidated positions and simplified reporting and organizational structures. As of September 30, 2024, the Company realized 82 million in annualized cost savings, or 70 million net of planned reinvestment associated with recent operational initiatives, which support our expectations for an annualized Q4 2024 core expense run rate of 965 million to 985 million. The expected core expense run rate excludes CDI amortization, merger and restructuring expense, exit and disposal costs, and the FDIC special assessment. 
 
 The following table presents the return on average assets (GAAP), average common shareholders' equity (GAAP), and average tangible common shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated. For each period presented, the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income. To the extent return on average common shareholders' equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisition-related intangible assets, we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders' equity. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is also used as part of our incentive compensation program for our executive officers. The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders' common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average common shareholders' equity.

 Additionally, management believes tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are meaningful measures of capital adequacy. Columbia believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the Company. Tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). In addition, tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). The tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders' equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are considered non-GAAP financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders' equity and the total shareholders' equity ratio.

 Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not reviewed or audited. Although we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. 

Net Interest Income 
 
 Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 
 
 Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 430.2 million, an increase of 2.8 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was driven by a 3.4 million increase in interest income, largely driven by higher income earned on loans due to higher average rates, which occurred despite a reduction in accretion income, and relatively stable funding costs prior to the reduction in the federal funds rate that occurred in the latter part of September. 
 
 The net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets) on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.56 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, unchanged from the three months ended June 30, 2024. A favorable balance sheet funding mix shift into lower-cost deposits and a slight increase in loan yields offset lower yields on securities and 
 contributed to margin stability between periods. The yield on loans and leases for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.22 , an increase of 2 basis points compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 The cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.29 , a decrease of 2 basis points compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Anticipated seasonal deposit inflows and focused campaigns run by our branch network contributed to customer balance growth during the third quarter. 
 
 Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 
 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.3 billion, a decrease of 58.5 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher average yields on interest-earning assets and a larger average balance sheet for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, as a result of the Merger.

Table of Contents 

 The net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was due to higher funding costs that reflect deposit repricing and a shift in product mix. 
 
 The yield on loans and leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 6.18 and 5.88 , respectively, an increase of 30 basis points, primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment and purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the Merger. 
 
 The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 3.28 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.38 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 90 basis points, due to a higher mix of higher-cost time deposits and term borrowing balances, as well as rising interest rates. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in the yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds. 
 
 The Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.50 in September 2024 and is expected to continue rate cuts into 2025 and 2026. However, between March 2022 and July 2023, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 5.25 . During that period, our net interest margin expanded as our asset sensitive balance sheet became increasingly profitable due to active rate increases by the Federal Reserve and the lagged impact to deposit pricing. After the Federal Reserve ceased increasing the federal funds rate, we experienced an increase in our funding costs that outpaced the increase in our earning asset yields, as our deposits continued to reprice higher and our funding base experienced a shift toward higher-cost sources, as Federal Reserve actions reduced available liquidity within the banking industry. As a result, our net interest margin contracted during the latter half of 2023 due to the impact of higher funding costs and minimal change to the average yield on earning assets. Our net interest margin began to stabilize in the 3.5 to 3.6 range beginning in February 2024 following a comprehensive review related to how we evaluate and approve deposit pricing. Further, the impact of balance sheet composition changes and the higher interest rate environment shifted the interest rate sensitivity position of the balance sheet to a liability sensitive position as of September 30, 2024 from an asset sensitive position at the onset of the rising rate environment.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 
 
 The Company had a 28.8 million provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a 31.8 million provision for the three months ended June 30, 2024. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, the provision for credit losses recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.30 , as compared to 0.34 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The change in provision for credit losses reflects credit migration trends and changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs were 29.1 million, as compared to 30.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.31 , as compared to 0.32 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Net charge-offs in the FinPac portfolio were 20.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 4.7 million decrease from the three months ended June 30, 2024, which is reflective of lower delinquencies in the transportation sector of the portfolio, which resulted in lower charge-off activity.

 Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 
 
 The Company had a 77.7 million provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 158.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the 88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, the provision for credit losses recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.28 , as compared to 0.61 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, we recalibrated the commercial CECL model to be more reflective of the post-Merger loan portfolio after a full year operating as a combined organization. We believe the recalibrated model is more reflective of the quality of our underwriting and borrower profiles. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs were 103.6 million, as compared to 67.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.37 , as compared to 0.26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs in the FinPac portfolio were 68.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 64.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs were 35.1 million for the Bank for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Typically, loans in a non-accrual status will not have an allowance for credit loss as they will be written down to their net realizable value or charged-off. However, the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements are determined by the loss given default calculated by the CECL model, and therefore homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements on non-accrual will have an allowance for credit loss amount until they become 181 days past due, at which time they are charged-off. The non-accrual leases and equipment finance agreements of 23.3 million as of September 30, 2024 have a related allowance for credit losses of 19.6 million, with the remaining loans written-down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, and are expected to be resolved with no additional material loss, absent further decline in market prices.

 Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 
 
 Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, increased primarily due to interest rate fluctuations resulting in the current quarter including a gain on the fair value of certain loans held for investment of 9.4 million, as compared to loss of 10.1 million for the prior quarter. These fair value adjustments are inversely influenced by the change in longer-term interest rates. 
 
 Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 
 
 Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to interest rate fluctuations resulting in a loss on the fair value of certain loans held for investment of 3.1 million in the current period as compared to a loss of 16.7 million in the prior year period. Further, our business growth strategy incorporates a collaborative team approach to deliver needs-based solutions to our customers, which deepens relationships and provides growth in sustainable fee income to the Bank. Trends in the current period as compared to the prior year period reflect a growing contribution from treasury management and card fees, financial services and trust revenue, and international banking fees. The increase was partially offset by the impact of rate fluctuations on swap derivatives with a loss in the current period compared to a gain in the prior year period, resulting in an unfavorable change of 5.4 million. 

Non-Interest Expense

 Comparison of current quarter to prior quarter 
 
 Salaries and employee benefits increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, due primarily to the prior period including a 7.7 million reversal of a compensation-related accrual, which did not repeat in the current period, partially offset by a decrease in the current quarter related to salaries and wages largely due to staff reductions that occurred predominantly over the second quarter. 
 Merger and restructuring expense decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, mainly due to the prior quarter including restructuring expense of 12.0 million, which was primarily severance payments. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our operations, resulting in streamlined roles, simplified reporting, and organizational structures. These actions contributed to expense reductions.

 Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 
 Salaries and employee benefits decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to reduction in employees related to the merger synergies realized in 2023 and the additional operational efficiency related activities in 2024, partially offset by the current year including nine months as a combined company, compared to only seven months during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Intangible amortization increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the current year including nine months of amortization associated with the core deposit intangible asset added as a result of the Merger, compared to only seven months of amortization during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Merger and restructuring expense decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with the largest drivers of the decrease being lower legal and professional fees and premises and equipment expense related to the Merger. Columbia closed the Merger and completed the core systems conversion during the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in Merger expenses was partially offset by 12.0 million in restructuring expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Income Taxes 
 
 The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.5 , as compared to 25.4 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 25.8 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The effective tax rates differed from the statutory rate principally because of state taxes, non-deductible FDIC assessments, and income on tax-exempt investment securities.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Investment Securities 
 
 Investment debt securities available for sale were 8.7 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 8.8 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to paydowns, calls, and maturities of 385.4 million, partially offset by an increase of 139.5 million in fair value of investment securities available for sale, due to lower rates during the period.

 We review investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, fair value in relationship to cost, extent and nature of the change in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, whether we intend to sell a security or if it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity, and other factors. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the available for sale investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of 400.3 million. Unrealized losses consisted primarily of unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of 328.0 million. The unrealized losses were attributable to changes in market interest rates or the widening of market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of these securities and are not attributable to changes in credit quality. In the opinion of management, no ACL was considered necessary on these debt securities as of September 30, 2024.

 Loans and Leases 
 
 Total loans and leases outstanding as of September 30, 2024 were 37.5 billion, an increase of 61.1 million as compared to December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to organic loan growth of 296.5 million, partially offset by charge-offs of 120.9 million and loan sales of 115.0 million. The loan to deposit ratio was 90 as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Loans 
 
 Commercial real estate and commercial loans are the largest classifications within earning assets, representing 41 and 20 , respectively, of average earning assets for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 40 and 20 , respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The increase in commercial real estate and commercial loan balances between September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was driven by commercial line utilization and new originations, partially offset by loan payoffs. 
 
 Delinquency and non-accrual loan movements during the period reflect an anticipated move toward a normalized credit environment following a phase of exceptional high credit quality. Non-performing loans during the quarter include 65.8 million in government guarantees on the commercial real estate, commercial, and residential portfolios, which offsets our credit exposure in those portfolios. 
 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans 
 
 The commercial real estate portfolio includes loans to developers and institutional sponsors supporting income-producing or for-sale commercial real estate properties. We seek to mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, commercial real estate loans held in our loan portfolio were 19.6 billion, an increase of 161.1 million compared to December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate concentrations are managed with a goal of optimizing relationship-driven commercial loans, as well as geographic, and business diversity, primarily in our footprint.

Table of Contents 

Loans secured by office properties represented approximately 8 of our total loan portfolio at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, comprised of 57 non-owner occupied, 40 owner occupied, and 3 construction loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 57 non-owner occupied, 39 owner occupied, and 4 construction loans at December 31, 2023. Excluding floating rate loans, which have already repriced to prevailing rates, only 5 of our office portfolio reprices through 2025. Office properties located in suburban markets secure the majority of our office portfolio as only 6 of non-owner occupied loans are located in downtown core business districts. 
 
 Loans secured by multifamily properties, including construction, represented approximately 19 of the total loan portfolio as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These assets continue to perform well due to demand for rental properties in our geographic footprint. Although management believes such concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability, a substantial decline in the economy in general, material increases in interest rates, changes in tax and rent control policies, tightening credit or refinancing markets, or a decline in real estate values in the Bank's primary geographic footprint in particular, could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans.

 Commercial Loans and Leases 
 
 Commercial loans are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, or other projects. We focus on borrowers doing business within our geographic markets. Commercial loans are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and/or the personal guarantee of the business owners. Lease and equipment financing products are designed to address the diverse financing needs of small to large companies, primarily for the acquisition of equipment. As of September 30, 2024, commercial loans held in our loan portfolio were 9.7 billion, an increase of 43.9 million compared to December 31, 2023, which is mainly attributable to credit line utilization during the period.

The leases and equipment finance portfolio represents approximately 17 of the commercial portfolio and 4 of the total loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 18 of the commercial portfolio and 5 of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023. The leasing portfolio has non-performing leases and charge-offs centered in the trucking and transportation portion of the portfolio. Net charge-offs in the FinPac lease portfolio were 20.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 24.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and net charge-offs were up 2.7 million in the remaining commercial portfolio from the prior quarter. Lower delinquencies in the transportation sector of the portfolio resulted in lower charge-off activity for the quarter. Delinquencies and non-accrual loan movements in the transportation and trucking portfolio over the year were anticipated and a slow recovery is in process for this portfolio.

 Residential Real Estate Loans 
 
 Residential real estate loans represent mortgage loans and lines of credit to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. As of September 30, 2024, residential real estate loans held in our loan portfolio were 8.0 billion, a decrease of 133.3 million as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to loan sales of 80.0 million in residential mortgage loans during the period. 
 
 Consumer Loans 
 
 Consumer loans, including secured and unsecured personal loans, home equity and personal lines of credit, and motor vehicle loans, decreased 10.6 million to 185.1 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to normal business activity.

 (2) Excludes certain mortgage loans guaranteed by GNMA, which Columbia has the unilateral right to repurchase but has not done so, totaling 3.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and 1.0 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 there were approximately 67.0 million or 0.18 of total loans, modified due to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, compared to 138.1 million or 0.37 as of December 31, 2023. A decline in economic conditions and other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that loans will not become 90 days or more past due, placed on non-accrual status, restructured, or transferred to other real estate owned in the future. As of September 30, 2024, there was an increase in non-performing loans representative of a more normalized credit environment relative to December 31, 2023.

 The provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. The change in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, reflects credit migration trends and changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models. The decrease in the provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflects the 88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans related to the Merger in 2023. This initial provision, as well as changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models and a recalibration of our CECL calculation in the first quarter of 2024, contributed to the change when compared to the same period in the current year. Net charge-offs were driven by the commercial loan portfolio, comprising 27.4 million of the net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2024 and 29.4 million for the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and percent of loans in each category to total loans and leases as of the dates presented: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Amount loans to total loans Amount loans to total loans Commercial real estate 158,216 52 125,888 52 Commercial 209,037 26 244,821 26 Residential 45,572 21 62,004 21 Consumer other 7,229 1 8,158 1 Allowance for credit losses on loans and leases 420,054 440,871

 To calculate the ACL, the CECL models use a forecast of future economic conditions and are dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables that are relevant to each of the Bank's loan and lease portfolios, as well as qualitative factors to address uncertainty not measured within the quantitative analysis. For the third quarter of 2024, the Bank used Moody's Analytics' August 2024 consensus economic forecast, which shows a similar economic situation from the forecast used in the prior quarter and used upward qualitative overlays, mainly in the commercial portfolio, to align with the S2 scenario and to account for the transportation segment of the lease portfolio. Refer to Note 5 Allowance for Credit Losses for further information. The models for calculating the ACL are sensitive to changes to economic variables, which could result in volatility as these assumptions change over time. 
 
 We believe that the ACL as of September 30, 2024 is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the information available. If the economic conditions decline, the Bank may need additional provisions for credit losses in future periods.

 (1) The changes in valuation inputs and assumptions principally reflect changes in discount rates and prepayment speeds, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates. 
 
 The following table presents information related to our residential serviced loan portfolio as of the dates presented: 
 (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Balance of loans serviced for others 7,965,538 8,175,664 MSR as a percentage of serviced loans 1.28 1.34 
 
 Residential MSR are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and borrowers are able to take advantage of a refinance incentive, prepayments increase, and the total value of existing servicing rights declines as expectations of future servicing fee collections decline. Historically, the fair value of our residential MSR will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall. 
 
 In September 2023, the Company closed the sale of 57.5 million in residential mortgage servicing rights, which related to the non-relationship component of the serviced loan portfolio. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 1.0 billion in goodwill, which was recorded as a result of the Merger. Goodwill is recorded in connection with business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had other intangible assets of 513.3 million, as compared to 603.7 million at December 31, 2023. As part of a business acquisition, the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as core deposits, which includes all deposits except certificates of deposit, was recognized at the Merger Date. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives. The core deposit intangible assets recorded are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of 10 years using the sum-of-the-years-digits method. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment. No impairment losses have been recognized in the periods presented.

 Deposits 
 
 Total deposits were 41.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 92.3 million as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to a reduction in brokered deposits, partially offset by customer deposit growth, largely in commercial customer balances, driven by focused campaigns run by our branch network. The interest-bearing deposit mix increased mainly due to a migration from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts as customers seek higher rates in the current interest rate environment. 
 
 The following table presents the deposit balances by category as of the dates presented: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Amount Amount Non-interest-bearing demand 13,534,065 33 14,256,452 34 Interest-bearing demand 8,444,424 20 8,044,432 19 Money market 11,351,066 27 10,324,454 25 Savings 2,450,924 6 2,754,113 7 Time, greater than 250,000 1,206,242 3 1,034,094 2 Time, 250,000 or less 4,527,967 11 5,193,475 13 Total deposits 41,514,688 100 41,607,020 100 
 
 The Company's total core deposits, which are deposits less time deposits greater than 250,000 and all brokered deposits, were 37.8 billion and 37.4 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company's brokered deposits totaled 2.5 billion and 3.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The FDIC generally insures up to 250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category, as defined by the FDIC. Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over 250,000 if they have funds in different ownership categories and all applicable FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account owner has in the same ownership category at the same bank are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 27.5 billion and 28.1 billion, respectively, of the Bank s deposits were estimated to be insured. Uninsured deposits are an estimated amount based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory requirements. Estimated uninsured deposits were 14.0 billion and 13.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, total available liquidity was 19.4 billion, or 138 of estimated uninsured deposits. 

Borrowings 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase of 183.8 million, a decrease of 68.3 million from December 31, 2023. The Bank had outstanding borrowings consisting of advances from the FHLB and FRB of 3.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 4.0 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to repayment of borrowings as well as general liquidity management. FHLB advances have fixed rates ranging from 5.10 to 5.25 , all of which are set to mature before the end of the first quarter of 2025. Advances from the FHLB are secured by investment securities and loans secured by real estate. The FRB borrowings have interest rates ranging from 4.76 to 4.93 and mature in January 2025, although the Company has the ability to repay balances prior to maturity without penalty. The FRB borrowings are secured by investment securities. 

Junior and Other Subordinated Debentures 
 
 We had junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of 419.6 million and 424.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease is mainly due to a decline of 4.0 million in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value. The change in fair value was driven by increases in credit spreads and modest changes in swap rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over three-month term SOFR.

 Liquidity and Cash Flow 
 
 The principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the Bank's ability to meet the day-to-day cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs. The Bank's liquidity strategy includes maintaining sufficient on-balance sheet liquidity to support balance sheet flexibility, fund growth in lending and investment portfolios, and deleverage non-deposit liabilities as economic conditions permit. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions, as well as meet its working capital and other needs. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources, including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources. 
 
 We monitor the sources and uses of funds daily to maintain an acceptable liquidity position. One source of funds includes public deposits. Individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits, typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of FDIC insurance. Public deposits represented 7 of total deposits at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state, depending on the individual state's risk assessment of depository institutions. Changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits, drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement, or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the Bank. 
 
 The Bank s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Bank s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits were 41.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared with 41.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The Bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of 3.8 billion. 
 
 In addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities, the Bank can sell securities under agreements to repurchase, issue brokered certificates of deposit, or utilize off-balance sheet funding sources. 
 
 The Bank maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include capacity to borrow from uncommitted lines of credit, advances from the FHLB, and the Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window. Availability of the uncommitted lines of credit is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility. These lines are intended to support short-term liquidity needs, and the agreements may restrict consecutive day usage.

 The Company is a separate entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. Substantially all of the Company's revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the Bank. There were 270.0 million of dividends paid by the Bank to the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. FDIC and Oregon Division of Financial Regulation approval is required for quarterly dividends from the Bank to the Company. 
 
 Although we expect the Bank's and the Company's liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during 2024, it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers' behavior in the current economic environment. In addition, in order to generate deposit growth, our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits. We may utilize borrowings or other funding sources, which are generally more costly than deposit funding, to support our liquidity levels. 
 
 Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations- The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. Our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits and borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, time deposits totaled 5.7 billion, of which 5.6 billion mature in a year or less. Total borrowings as of September 30, 2024 were 3.7 billion, all of which mature within one year. These arrangements also include off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various forms of guarantees. As of September 30, 2024, our loan commitments were 10.2 billion, and letter of credit commitments were 238.7 million. A portion of the commitments will eventually result in funded loans and increase our profitability through net interest income when drawn and unused commitment fees prior to being drawn. Refer to Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies for further information. Financing commitments, letters of credit and deferred purchase commitments are presented at contractual amounts and do not necessarily reflect future cash outflows as many are expected to expire unused or partially used.

Capital Resources 
 
 Shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2024 was 5.3 billion, an increase of 278.8 million from December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders' equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was principally due to net income of 390.4 million and other comprehensive income of 106.3 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid of 227.4 million during the period. 
 
 The Company's dividend policy considers, among other things, earnings, regulatory capital levels, the overall payout ratio and expected asset growth to determine the amount of dividends declared, if any, on a quarterly basis. There is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased. We cannot predict the extent of the economic decline that could result in inadequate earnings, regulatory restrictions and limitations, changes to our capital requirements, or a decision to increase capital by retention of earnings, which may result in the inability to pay dividends at previous levels, or at all. 
 
 On August 12, 2024, Columbia declared a cash dividend in the amount of 0.36 per common share based on second quarter 2024 performance, which was paid on September 9, 2024. 
 
 The following table presents cash dividends declared and dividend payout ratios (dividends declared per common share divided by basic earnings per common share) for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Dividend declared per common share

 The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. 
 
 In 2020, the federal bank regulatory authorities finalized a rule to provide banking organizations that implemented CECL in 2020 the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay. The Company elected this capital relief to delay the estimated regulatory capital impact of adopting CECL, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital. Currently, the Company is phasing out the cumulative adjustment as calculated at the end of 2021, by adjusting it by 75 in 2022, 50 through 2023, and 25 in 2024, culminating with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory well-capitalized requirements. 
 
 The following table shows the Company's consolidated and the Bank's capital adequacy ratios compared to the regulatory minimum capital ratio and the regulatory minimum capital ratio needed to qualify as a "well-capitalized" institution, as calculated under regulatory guidelines of the Basel III at the dates presented:

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Our assessment of market risk as of September 30, 2024 indicates there are no material changes in the qualitative disclosures from those in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Interest Rate Simulation Impact on Net Interest Income 
 
 For the scenarios shown, the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates over a twelve-month period and no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet. 
 
 The scenarios are as of the dates presented: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Year 1 Year 2 Year 1 Year 2 Up 300 basis points (0.9) (0.5) (2.1) (1.9) Up 200 basis points (0.5) (0.2) (1.4) (1.1) Up 100 basis points (0.3) (0.7) (0.5) Down 100 basis points 0.5 (0.1) 0.5 0.1 Down 200 basis points 1.3 (0.2) 1.1 (0.2) Down 300 basis points 2.3 (0.6) 1.6 (0.8) 
 
 An interest rate simulation model is used to estimate the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates. This model has inherent limitations, and these results are based on a given set of rate changes and assumptions at one point in time. Our primary analysis assumes a static balance sheet, both in terms of the total size and mix of our balance sheet, meaning cash flows from the maturity or repricing of assets and liabilities are redeployed in the same instrument at modeled rates. We employ estimates based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario, including changes in the size or mix of the balance sheet, new volume rates for new balances, the rate of prepayments, and the correlation of pricing to changes in the interest rate environment. For example, for interest-bearing deposit balances, we utilize a repricing "beta" assumption, which is an estimate for the change in interest-bearing deposit costs given a change in the short-term market interest rate and is calibrated using the experience from prior rate cycles. 
 
 The simulation model does not take into account any future actions management could undertake to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or the impact a change in interest rates may have on our credit risk profile, loan prepayment estimates and spread relationships, which can change regularly. Actions we could undertake include, but are not limited to, growing or contracting the balance sheet, changing the composition of the balance sheet, or changing our pricing strategies for loans or deposits. 
 
 Simulation results indicate limited exposure to interest rate risk in either increasing or decreasing rate environments. The September 30, 2024 sensitivity in the most plausible down rate scenario is nearly unchanged from December 31, 2023. 
 
 The short-term interest rate environment is primarily a function of the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve s focus has gradually shifted toward attaining a specified level of the federal funds rate to achieve the long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth. The federal funds rate is the basis for overnight funding and drives the short end of the yield curve. Longer maturities are influenced by the market s expectations for economic growth and inflation but can also be influenced by Federal Reserve purchases and sales and expectations of monetary policy going forward. 
 
 Starting in March 2022, in response to persistent inflation, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate from 0.00 - 0.25 to 5.25 - 5.50 and maintained the target rate at that level from July 2023 until September 2024 when the target range was lowered to 4.75 - 5.00 . Based on the FOMC Members median expectations for the fed funds target rate, the fed funds rate is projected to decline through 2026. Increases in the federal funds rate and the unwinding of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet could cause overall interest rates to rise, which may negatively impact the U.S. real estate markets and affect deposit growth and pricing. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.

 Economic Value of Equity 
 
 Another interest rate sensitivity measure we utilize is the quantification of economic value changes for all financial assets and liabilities, given an increase or decrease in market interest rates. This approach provides a longer-term view of interest rate risk, capturing all future expected cash flows. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. Importantly, EVE values only the current balance sheet, excluding the growth assumptions used in net interest income sensitivity analyses. Additionally, the results are highly dependent on assumptions for products with embedded prepay optionality and indeterminate maturities. The uncertainty surrounding important assumptions used in EVE analysis may limit its efficacy. Assets and liabilities with option characteristics are measured based on different interest rate path valuations using statistical rate simulation techniques. The projections are by their nature forward-looking and therefore inherently uncertain and include various assumptions regarding cash flows and discount rates. 
 
 The table below illustrates the effects of various instantaneous rate changes on the fair values of financial assets and liabilities compared to the corresponding carrying values and fair values as of the dates presented: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Up 300 basis points (15.9) (21.9) Up 200 basis points (11.9) (14.6) Up 100 basis points (6.0) (7.1) Down 100 basis points 5.6 6.8 Down 200 basis points 9.9 12.0 Down 300 basis points 13.5 15.1 
 
 Our EVE analysis indicates a liability sensitive profile in increasing interest rate scenarios. This suggests a sudden or sustained increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in our estimated EVE, as the decrease in the economic value of our interest-earning assets exceeds the economic value change of interest-bearing liabilities. In declining interest rate scenarios, our EVE increases. This occurs as the increase in the economic value of interest-earning assets exceeds the decline in economic value of interest-bearing liabilities, including the core deposit intangible. As of September 30, 2024, our estimated EVE (fair value of financial assets and liabilities) was above our book value of equity primarily due to the economic value of the core deposit intangible. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to information relating to us that is required to be included in our periodic filings with the SEC. The disclosure controls and procedures were last evaluated by management as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 No change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

The regular annual meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting shall be held on such day and at such time following the close of the Corporation s fiscal year as shall be determined each year by the Board of Directors. If such annual meeting is omitted by oversight or otherwise during such period, a subsequent annual meeting may nonetheless be held, and any business transacted or elections held at such meeting shall be as valid as if the annual meeting had been held during the period provided above. SECTION 1.3 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time by the Chair, the Chief Executive Officer, (the CEO ), the President, a majority of the Board of Directors, or upon the delivery of a written demand of the holders of record of ten (10) percent of the outstanding stock entitled to vote on any issue proposed to be considered at the proposed special meeting to the Secretary of the Corporation (such demand being referred to as a Demand ). SECTION 1.4 Nominations and Business at Annual and Special Meetings. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the shareholders at an annual or special meeting of shareholders may be made only: (A) pursuant to the Corporation s notice of meeting delivered pursuant to Section 1.5 of these bylaws; (B) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof); (C) in the case of an annual meeting, by any shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in Section 1.17 of these bylaws; or (D) in the case of a special meeting: (i) called pursuant to a Demand for a special meeting delivered in accordance with Section 1.3 of these bylaws, as specified in such Demand by the shareholder(s) making such Demand who shall have complied with the notice procedures set forth in Section 1.17 of these bylaws; or (ii) called by the Corporation other than pursuant to a Demand, if directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation s notice of meeting delivered pursuant to Section 1.5 of these bylaws, then nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made by any shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in Section 1.17 of these bylaws. Any such shareholder may nominate such number of persons for election to the Board of Directors as is less than or equal to the number of position(s) as are specified in the Corporation s notice of meeting. 

2 Clauses (C) and (D) of this Section 1.4 shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to make nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors or submit other business before a meeting of shareholders. The notice procedures set forth in Section 1.17 of these bylaws shall be deemed satisfied by a shareholder who seeks to have the shareholder s proposal included in the Corporation s proxy statement and identified as a proposal in the Corporation s form of proxy pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 1934 Act if such shareholder complies with the provisions of that Rule. SECTION 1.5 Notice. Written notice stating the place, day, and hour of the meeting, and in case of a special meeting the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than ten (10) days nor more thatthan sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting (except when the purpose of the meeting includes action on an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, of the Corporation (the Articles of Incorporation ), a plan of merger or share exchange, a proposed sale of assets pursuant to RCWSection 23B.12.020, of the Washington Business Corporation Act (the WBCA ), or the dissolution of the Corporation, in which case notice shall be delivered not less than twenty (20) nor more than sixty (60) days before the meeting date), either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the Chair, the Chief Executive OfficerCEO, the President, the Secretary, or the person or persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the shareholder at histheir address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the Corporation. Each shareholder shall be responsible for providing the Secretary with the shareholder s current mailing address to which notices of meetings and all other corporate notices may be sent. A shareholder may waive any notice required for any meeting by executing a written waiver of notice either before or after said meeting and such waiver shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice. The attendance of a shareholder at a shareholders meeting, in person or by proxy, shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting. SECTION 1.6 Quorum; Vote Required. A majority of the shares entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. When a quorum is present at any meeting, except as set forth below, action on a matter is approved if the votes cast favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or law. The Corporation elects to be governed by Section 23B.10.205 of the Washington Business Corporation Act (WBCA)WBCA with respect to the election of directors, as set forth in this Section 1.6. In any election of directors that is not a contested election the candidates elected are those receiving a majority of votes cast. For purposes of this Section 1.6, a majority of votes cast means that the number of shares voted for a director nominee must exceed the number of shares voted against that director nominee. The following shall not be considered votes cast for this purpose: (i) a share whose ballot is marked as withheld; (ii) a share otherwise present at the meeting but for which there is an abstention; and (iii) a share otherwise present at the meeting as to which a shareholder of record gives no authority or direction. A nominee for director in an election that is not a contested election who does not receive a majority of votes cast, but who was a director at the time of the election, shall continue to serve as a director for a term that shall terminate on the date that is the earlier of: (i) ninety (90) days from the date on which the voting results of the election are determined, (ii) the date on which an individual is selected by the Board of Directors to fill the office held by such director, which selection shall be deemed to constitute the filling of a vacancy by the Board of Directors, or (iii) the date on which the director s resignation is accepted by the Board. In a contested election, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this Section 1.6, a contested election is any meeting of shareholders for which (i) the Secretary of the Corporation receives a notice that a shareholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice requirements for shareholder nominees for director set forth in Section 1.17 of these bylaws, (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such shareholder on or prior to the last date that a notice of nomination for such meeting is timely as determined under 

3 Section 1.17 and (iii) the Board of Directors has not determined before the notice of meeting is given that the shareholder s nominee(s) do not create a bona fide election contest. For purposes of clarity and to resolve any ambiguity under WBCA Section 23B.10.205 of the WBCA, it is assumed that for purposes of determining the number of director nominees, on the last day for delivery of a notice under Section 1.17, there is a candidate nominated by the Board of Directors for each of the director positions to be voted on at the meeting. Nothing in this bylaw is intended to limit the authority of the Board of Directors to determine that a bona fide election contest does not exist, in which event it shall disclose the applicable voting regime in the notice of meeting or, if such determination occurs after such notice has been sent, send a new notice which shall include disclosure of the applicable voting regime. SECTION 1.7 Adjournment. A majority of the shares represented at a meeting, even if less than a quorum, may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally stated in the notice of meeting. The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. SECTION 1.8 Chair of Meeting. The Chair, or in histheir absence, the Chief Executive OfficerCEO, or the President, shall preside at all meetings of the shareholders unless the Board of Directors shall otherwise determine. The Board of Directors may appoint any shareholder to act as chair of the meeting. SECTION 1.9 Secretary of Meeting. The Secretary shall act as a secretary at all meetings of the shareholders, and in histheir absence, the presiding officer may appoint any person to act as secretary. SECTION 1.10 Conduct of Meetings. Shareholder meetings shall be conducted in an orderly and fair manner, but the presiding officer shall not be bound by any technical rules of parliamentary procedure. SECTION 1.11 Voting. Each outstanding share shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders. SECTION 1.12 Proxies. At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by histheir duly authorized attorney in fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be valid after eleven (11) months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. SECTION 1.13 Shareholder Advisor. A shareholder or holder of a valid proxy may be accompanied at any shareholders meeting by one personal advisor, but no such advisor may address the meeting without the consent of the presiding officer. SECTION 1.14 Recording of Proceedings. The proceedings of a shareholders meeting may not be mechanically or electronically recorded other than by the Secretary or acting secretary without the express approval of all individuals in attendance at the meeting. SECTION 1.15 Record Date. For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders. Such date in any case shall not be more than sixty (60) days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such determination of 

4 shareholders is to be taken. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Board declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof. SECTION 1.16 List of Shareholders. The Secretary of the Corporation shall make a complete record of the shareholders entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each as shown on the Corporation s stock transfer books on the record date. Such record shall be kept on file at the registered office of the Corporation for a period of ten (10) days prior to the meeting of shareholders. Such record shall be produced and kept open at the time and place of the shareholders meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the meeting for any proper purpose. SECTION 1.17 Notice of Shareholder Business to be Conducted at a Meeting of Shareholders. In order for a shareholder to properly bring any nomination of a person for election to the Board of Directors or other item of business before a meeting of shareholders, such shareholder (the Noticing Shareholder must give timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation, and, in the case of business other than nominations, such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for shareholder action.

(C) Notwithstanding anything in Section 1.17(A)(i) of this bylaw to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting, a Noticing Shareholder s notice required by this bylaw shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation and such notice otherwise complies with the requirements of this Section 1.17.

The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings of shareholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the Chair shall have the right and authority to convene and adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of the Chair, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting.

Unless and to 

8 the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the Chair, meetings of shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.17, unless otherwise required by applicable law, if the Noticing Shareholder (or a qualified representative of the Noticing Shareholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of shareholders to present a nomination or proposed business previously put forward by or on behalf of such Noticing Shareholder or, immediately prior to the commencement of such meeting, such Noticing Shareholder does not provide a written certification to the Corporation on and as of the date of the applicable meeting that such Noticing Shareholder and each Covered Person, if any, is then in compliance with this Section 1.17, then such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.

Nothing in this bylaw shall be deemed to affect any rights of (a) shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act or (b) holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Articles of Incorporation. (E) For purposes of this bylaw, a Person shall be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, shall be deemed to Beneficially Own and shall be deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of, any Voting Stock (i) that such Person or any of such Person s Affiliates or Associates (as defined under Regulation 12B under the 1934 Act or any successor provision thereto) is deemed to beneficially own within the meaning of Section 13(d) of, and Regulation 13D under, the 1934 Act or any successor provision thereto, or (ii) that is the subject of, or the reference security for or that underlies any Derivative Interest of such Person or any of such Person s Affiliates or Associates (as defined under Regulation 12B under the 1934 Act or any successor provision thereto), with the number of shares of Voting Stock deemed Beneficially Owned being the notional or other number of shares of Voting Stock specified in the documentation evidencing the Derivative Interest as being subject to be acquired upon the exercise or settlement of the Derivative Interest or as the basis upon which the value or settlement amount of such Derivative Interest is to be calculated in whole or in part or, if no such number of shares of Voting Stock is specified in such documentation, as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith to be the number of shares of Voting Stock to which the Derivative Interest relates.

In no event may Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment. Each payment under this Plan shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A. In no event shall the date of termination of the Executive s employment be deemed to occur until the Executive experiences a Separation from Service, and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the date on which such Separation from Service takes place shall be the Date of Termination.

 If Executive is considered a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A (as determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Company as in effect on the date of Separation from Service), any payment that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A that is otherwise due to Executive under this Plan during the six (6)-month period following your separation from service (as determined in accordance with Section 409A) on account of Executive s Separation from Service will be accumulated and paid to Executive on the first business day of the seventh month following your separation from service (or such regular Company payroll date that is within two weeks of such business day, the Delayed Payment Date ). If Executive dies during the postponement period, the amounts and entitlements delayed on account of Section 409A will be paid to the personal representative of Executive s estate on the first to occur of the Delayed Payment Date or thirty (30) calendar days after the date of Executive s death.
