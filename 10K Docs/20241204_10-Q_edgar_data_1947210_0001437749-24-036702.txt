NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy, and plans and objectives of management for future operations are forward-looking statements. In some cases, these statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as believes, estimates, anticipates, expects, plans, intends, may, could, might, will, should, approximately, project, or potential, or negative or other variations of those terms or comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. 
 
 Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events, developments, and circumstances relating to High Roller Technologies, Inc., our industry, and/or general economic or other conditions that may or may not occur in the future or may occur on longer or shorter timelines or to a greater or lesser degree than anticipated. In addition, even if future events, developments and circumstances are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this report, they may not be predictive of results or developments in future periods. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this report, such information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this report as a result of the following factors: 

our ability to effectively compete in the global entertainment and gaming industries; 

our ability to manage current operations and successfully acquire and integrate new operations; 

our ability to obtain and maintain licenses with gaming authorities; 

our inability to recognize deferred tax assets and tax loss carryforwards; 

market and global conditions and economic factors beyond our control, as well as the potential impact of general economic conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates, on our liquidity, operations and personnel; 

significant competition and competitive pressures from other companies worldwide in the industries in which we operate; 

our ability to raise financing in the future; 

our success in retaining or recruiting officers, key employees or directors; 

the risks arising from doing business in foreign countries; 

legislation, regulation, or other governmental action that affects our products, taxes, international trade regulation, or other aspects of our business; 

the costs and effectiveness of our marketing efforts, as well as our ability to promote our brands, future investments in our business, our anticipated capital expenditures, and our estimates regarding our capital requirements, our ability to compete effectively with existing competitors and new market entrants; 

the performance of the Company s information technology systems and its ability to maintain data security; 

litigation and our ability to obtain and maintain the intellectual property needed to adequately protect our products, and our ability to avoid infringing or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties; 

and other risks described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur at all. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 Any forward-looking statements that we make in this report speak only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or to reflect new information, actual results, revised expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required by applicable law. 
 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to we, us, our, and the Company refer to High Roller Technologies, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.

HIGH ROLLER TECHNOLGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(unaudited)

reverse stock split of the Company s outstanding common stock, which became effective on January 16, 2024. Fractional shares, if any, were rounded up or down to the nearest whole share, as appropriate. As a result of this reverse split, all share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for the impact of the reverse stock split for all periods presented. The reverse stock split did not impact the number of authorized shares of common stock, which remained at shares, or the authorized shares of preferred stock, which remained at shares, nor the par value of such shares. 

thousand, an accumulated deficit of thousand and unrestricted cash resources of thousand at September 30, 2024 . During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 , the Company incurred a net loss of thousand and thousand, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company incurred a net loss of thousand and thousand, respectively. 
 
 The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has financed its working capital requirements historically through the continuing financial support of affiliates and related parties. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its continuing obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due, to fund the development and expansion of its business activities, and to generate sustainable operating profits and cash flows in the future. 
 
 As a result of these factors, at September 30, 2024, management had concluded that there was substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are being issued is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and to obtain additional capital financing as may be necessary, of which there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts. The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, has also expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated Financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty. 
 
 In October 2024 the Company completed its initial public offering and listed its common stock on the NYSE American which generated approximately . The Company s pro forma cash position after the completion of its IPO was thousand and its proforma working capital was thousand. 
 
 As market conditions present uncertainty as to the Company s ability to secure additional funds, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, as and when necessary, to continue to conduct and develop operations. 
 
 If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company s ongoing cash requirements, the Company would be required to scale back or discontinue its operations, or obtain funds, if available, through strategic alliances or joint ventures that could require the Company to relinquish rights to and/or control of gaming licenses and/or operations, or to discontinue operations entirely. 

and , respectively, of the Company s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reside in bank accounts located outside of the United States. The Company s primary foreign currency exchange risk occurs between the time when other foreign currencies are exchanged for wagering on the Platform, and when those funds are settled to the Company in Euro. The relatively stable status of the Euro reduces but does not eliminate the Company s exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. In addition, gains and losses related to translating certain cash balances from the Euro to the U.S. Dollar, as well as payable balances also impact net income. As the Company s foreign operations expand, results may be impacted further by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which the Company does business. The Company has not used any derivative financial instruments to manage its foreign currency exchange risk exposure. 

In most of the Company s operations, the Company transacts primarily in the Euro, including wagered amounts, net revenue, revenue share, and employee-related compensation costs. Operating arrangements with payment service providers who convert player funds to the Euro from other currencies, for example the Canadian Dollar, could further negatively impact foreign currency exchange risk if the exchange spot rates used are unfavorable as compared to European Central Bank exchange rates. Foreign currency gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in net loss and are included within general and administrative expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company incurred foreign currency transaction losses of thousand and thousand, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company incurred foreign currency transaction losses of thousand and thousand, respectively. While the Company expects these losses to persist through 2024 , it continues to manage and negotiate contracts with payment providers. 
 
 The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders equity (deficit) as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency fluctuations between the functional and reporting currency can significantly impact the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have a material impact on the Company s financial statement presentation or disclosures.

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company excluded the outstanding securities summarized below, which entitle the holders thereof to acquire shares of common stock, from its calculation of earnings per share for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The additional securities excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation are as follows: 

Stock options 
 Restricted stock units 

shares of common stock was reserved for grant and issuance pursuant to the equity incentive plan. 

A summary of option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023 is presented below: 

Granted 
 Exercised 
 Modified/Cancelled 
 Expired/Forfeited 
 Outstanding - December 31, 2023 
 Granted 9.56 
 Exercised 
 Modified/Cancelled 
 Expired/Forfeited 
 Outstanding - September 30, 2024 
 Exercisable - September 30, 2024 

Options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions. There were options granted during the year ended December 31, 2023 . 

Expected term (years) 5.14 - 5.52 
 Risk-free interest rate - 
 Expected volatility 
 Expected dividends yield 
 Exercise price 

The Company estimates its expected volatility by using a combination of historical share price volatilities of similar companies within the Company s industry. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates for the appropriate term of the Company s options on a grant date. The expected option term assumption is estimated using the simplified method and is based on the mid-point between vest date and the remaining contractual term of the option, since the Company does not have sufficient exercise history to estimate expected term of its historical option awards. 
 
 Share-based compensation related to options is included in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as follows: 

Advertising and promotions 
 Product software and development 
 Total 

Compensation cost related to non-vested option awards not yet recognized as of September 30, 2024 was thousand and will be recognized over the next 2.58 years. 
 
 On March 8, 2023, the Company amended a stock option agreement originally issued on September 1, 2022 to purchase shares of common stock at the initial public offering price.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 
 Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this MD A to the Company, we, us, or our refer to the company, High Roller Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Our Business 
 
 We are an evolving and growth-oriented iCasino and entertainment company that focuses primarily on online casino betting in Europe and other markets. Our mission is to offer consistently superior customer experience by (i) providing fast onboarding, easy log-in and re-log-in, (ii) assuring efficient and secure payment processing, (iii) providing prompt payouts on player winnings, (iv) offering generous bonuses, bonus play and free spins on popular games, (v) utilizing an interactive environment for player engagement leading to longer stays online and more play, (vi) maintaining 24/7/365 customer service to assure customer satisfaction and (vii) providing an array of responsible gaming tools and AI models to ensure a safe gaming experience. 
 
 High Roller Technologies, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2021 as a holding company, with the intent to seek an initial public offering on a United States securities exchange. In January 2022 we launched HighRoller.com to deliver more immersive real money gaming experiences for the iCasino market. Prior to our transition to the HighRoller.com Platform we operated our online iCasino activities under the casinoroom.com domain name. We operate an online gaming business offering casino games to customers in various jurisdictions worldwide under the HighRoller.com and fruta.com domain names principally utilizing our Curacao license, and under our Happy Hour Solutions Agreements accessing revenue generated under the Estonian license. Unless further extended, the Happy Hour Solutions Agreements terminate on the earlier of our receipt of an Estonian license or December 31, 2025. 
 
 Through our Platform we provide iCasino, or online casino, consisting of the full suite of games available in land-based casinos, such as blackjack, roulette, baccarat, poker, and slot machines. We generate revenue through hold, or gross winnings, as users play against the house. We believe iCasino provides lower volatility versus land-based casinos due to easier advance-based predictions on gaming rules and statistics. 
 
 We currently are present and active in several markets around the world. Our focus will primarily be to enter regulated markets in Europe, North and South America. We intend to seek entry into one or more regulated North American markets utilizing proceeds from this offering but have not identified any target or budgeted any amount for such entries. We currently expect that initial entry into any of these regulated North American markets to occur in approximately twelve months from the receipt of proceeds from this initial public offering. No assurance can be given that these efforts will prove successful. Our business may suffer if we are unable to open new geographical markets or if we are unable to continue expanding within existing markets. 

23

We are implementing a multi-brand strategy to launch new brands utilizing our current licenses and using our existing resources. The scalability of our Platform allows the Company to use existing resources to launch new brands that provide access to new target demographics and generate new revenues through existing player acquisition channels while maintaining the current cost structure with nominal incremental costs. The conversion of marketing spend into new player acquisition or existing player reactivation on our current and future portfolio of brands will ultimately determine where player acquisition funds are spent on a market-to-market basis. While no assurances can be given that these efforts will be successful, and management s time as well as nominal incremental costs may be spent with limited financial results, management believes that this strategy mitigates any material negative impact on operations or financial position by leveraging scalable processes and technologies within our Platform. If market reception is successful, a new brand may generate material revenue. We soft launched our second active brand, Fruta.com, in December 2023, allowing select players to test the website prior to going live in February 2024. We are currently exploring opportunities for other future brand launches. We expect to launch at least one new brand over the next twelve months to expand our market share in existing markets and reduce customer acquisition costs and attrition rates through cross-selling and brand diversification. 
 
 We obtain our iCasino game offerings from over 70 suppliers such as Pragmatic Play, Push Gaming, Evolution Gaming for Live Dealer Services, Big Time Gaming, Red Tiger Gaming, Play n Go, Netent, Quickspin and others. These content and gaming licenses are subject to standard revenue-share agreements, whereby suppliers receive a percentage of the net gaming revenue generated from their respective casino games and payment combinations, including agreed upon fixed costs. 
 
 Our plan is to excite the iCasino industry by focusing on streaming and social experiences based on real money gaming experiences for the customer. 
 
 During the first half of 2022, we rebranded our iCasino operations from CasinoRoom.com to HighRoller.com and concurrently commenced to reposition our legacy gaming operator CasinoRoom.com into an online casino ratings and reviews portal that would generate high-value leads and targeted search engine traffic (SEO) for HighRoller.com and customer leads for other casinos particularly in markets that we do not serve. We believe that our new CasinoRoom.com affiliate model site may further enable us to support future brands which we may launch or acquire with targeted traffic. 
 
 Spike Up Media, an affiliate of our founders, is one of a handful of globally foremost providers of lead generation and we believe that our association with Spike Up Media provides high-quality, cost-effective lead generation converting into active customers which together with our favorable customer acquisition costs and customer retention will result in favorable gross operating margins. 
 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 
 On January 16, 2024, our Board of Directors approved and our shareholders ratified a 1-for-3.95689 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock, which became effective on that date. All share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated.

Revenue 
 
 Revenue decreased by 2,658 thousand or 12 , to 19,826 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 22,484 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the exit from Hungary due to a change in the regulatory environment in the second half of 2023, further impacted by decreases across some of our existing markets, partially offset by increases in Finland. The amount of real money bets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and 2023 was approximately 505,707 thousand and 535,300 thousand, respectively. Although total real money bets decreased by approximately 1 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the decrease in revenue of approximately 12 during the same periods was the result of a higher return to players. We expect to see further increases in revenue from Finland continuing through the end of 2024, offsetting, at least in part, the decrease in revenue resulting from our exit from Hungary. 
 
 Revenue was flat, decreasing by 53 thousand or less than 1 , to 7,516 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7,569 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Loss from operations 
 
 Loss from operations was 3,779 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 957 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the decreases in revenue due primarily to the exit of a market in the second half of 2023, while the loss is partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses over the same period. 
 
 Loss from operations was 474 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 185 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the decrease in revenue offset with the decrease in operating expenses.

 Other Trends Impacting Our Business 
 
 Our results of operations can and generally do fluctuate due to other factors such as level of customer engagement, online casino results and other factors that are outside of our control or that we cannot reasonably predict. Our quarterly financial performance depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Customer engagement in our online offerings may vary due to, among other things, customer satisfaction with our platform, our offerings and those of our competitors, our marketing efforts, public sentiment or an economic downturn. As customer engagement varies, so may our quarterly financial performance. 
 
 Our quarterly and annual financial results may also be impacted by the number and amount of betting losses and jackpot payouts we experience. Although our losses are limited per stake to a maximum payout in our online casino offering, when looking at bets across a period of time, these losses can be significant. As part of our online casino offerings, we offer local progressive jackpot games that are operated by us and larger progressive jackpots which are global, operating across multiple operators and guaranteed by our game suppliers, generally Games Global or Netent. Each time a customer plays one of our local progressive jackpot games, we contribute a portion of the amount bet to the jackpot for that game or group of games. When a progressive jackpot is won, the jackpot is paid out and is reset to a predetermined base amount. As winning the jackpot is determined by a random mechanism, we cannot foresee when a jackpot will be won and we do not insure against jackpot payouts. Paying the local progressive jackpot decreases our cash position and, depending upon the size of the jackpot, payouts may have a significant negative affect on our cash flow and financial condition. Global progressive jackpots are guaranteed and paid by the game suppliers and are not a liability directly affecting us. 
 
 We operate within the global gaming and entertainment industry, which is comprised of diverse products and offerings that compete for consumers time and disposable income. We face and expect to continue to face significant competition from other industry players both within existing and new markets including from competitors with access to more resources or experience. Customer demands for new and innovative offerings and features require us to continue to invest in new technologies and content to improve the customer experience. Many jurisdictions in which we operate or intend to operate in the future have unique regulatory and/or technological requirements, which require us to have robust, scalable networks and infrastructure, and agile engineering and software development capabilities. The global gaming and entertainment industry has seen significant consolidation, regulatory change and technological development over the last few years, and we expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future, which may create opportunities for us but may also create competitive and margin pressures. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital and capital expenditure needs, contractual obligations and other commitments, with cash flows from operations. Our current working capital needs relate mainly to supporting our existing businesses, the growth of these businesses in their existing markets and their expansion into other geographic regions, as well as our employees compensation and benefits. Historically, we have relied on affiliates and related party relationships to support our working capital needs for operations. 

29

We had 2,087 thousand in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 (excluding customer cash deposits, which we segregate from our operating cash balances on behalf of our real-money customers for all jurisdictions and products, and restricted cash). For the year ended December 31, 2023 we had net loss of 2,818 thousand, had net cash provided by operations of 763 thousand, an accumulated deficit of 21,220 thousand, and negative working capital of 4,577 thousand. 
 
 We had 1,329 thousand in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 (excluding customer cash deposits, which we segregate from our operating cash balances on behalf of our real-money customers for all jurisdictions and products, and restricted cash). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we had net loss of 3,854 thousand, had net cash used in operations of 1,355 thousand, an accumulated deficit of 25,074 thousand and negative working capital of 8,776 thousand. On June 6, 2024, the Company entered into interest free short-term unsecured loans with existing shareholders for 500 thousand. The loans are due and payable on or before December 31, 2024. If not paid on or before maturity the notes will accrue interest at a rate of 10 per year from the date of funds receipt. The loans are expected to be repaid substantially from operations. We believe that our existing cash resources and the expected revenue and cash flows from operations together with net proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next 18 to 24 months. 
 
 In June 2023 we entered into a debt conversion agreement with Ellmount Interactive A.B. and Spike Up Media A.B. pursuant to which we issued 631,809 shares of common stock, valued at 7.91 per share, to Spike Up in exchange for 5,000 thousand that we owed to Spike Up through June 30, 2023 for services provided to our subsidiary, HR Entertainment Ltd. Following this stock issuance, we owed Spike Up a balance of approximately 421 thousand, for such services, that was paid in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 The report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, includes a going concern explanatory paragraph in which such firm expressed that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report do not include any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet continuing obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, to fund the development and expansion of our business activities, and to generate sustainable profitable operations and cash flows in the future. Management s plan is to provide for our capital requirements by raising equity capital through one or more private placements or public offerings. No assurance can be given that we will be able to secure sufficient additional financing as and when necessary and on acceptable terms, or at all, to sustain and improve operating results and cash flows under the new business model. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off-balance sheet arrangements.

Net cash used in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 1,934 thousand to 1,355 thousand as compared to net cash provided by operations of 579 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to a a net increase in the various operating asset and liability accounts, particularly the net increase in due from/due to affiliates, as well as an increase in stock based compensation expense. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was 325 thousand as compared to net cash used by investing activities of 394 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The change is due to an increase in capitalized internal-use software costs and the purchase of property and equipment during the period. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 334 thousand as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 319 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , and is related to the payment of deferred offering costs and a loan made by existing shareholders. 
 
 Restricted cash (current) was 1,592 thousand and 1,958 thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to assumptions used in accruals for potential legal and other liabilities, recovery of amounts held in escrow, realization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, accrued jackpots and the realization of deferred tax assets. 

31

The following critical accounting estimates affect the more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 Our long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, operating lease-right of use assets and indefinite lived assets (i.e. trademarks and domain names). 
 
 We evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The factors that would be considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the long-lived asset is used and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. If indicators of impairment are identified, we perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis of the long-lived assets. Asset groups are written down only to the extent that their carrying value is lower than their respective fair value. Fair values of the asset group are determined by discounting the cash flows at a rate that approximates the cost of capital of a market participant. 
 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and domain names. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather they are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, management evaluates whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Impairment tests are performed, at a minimum, in the fourth quarter of each year. 
 
 To test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative impairment test is performed. The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows. 
 
 We evaluated qualitative factors at December 31, 2023 related to the HighRoller domain name and concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. Therefore, no further impairment considerations were deemed necessary on the HighRoller domain name as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 We did not have any impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2023 or the period ended September 30, 2024. 

32

Share-Based Compensation 
 
 We record share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ASC 718 and recognize share-based compensation expense in the period in which a grantee is required to provide service, which is generally over the vesting period of the individual share-based payment award. Compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is not recognized until it is probable that the performance target will be achieved. Compensation expense for awards is recognized over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. 
 
 Unit awards are classified as either an equity award or a liability award depending on whether the award contains certain repurchase provisions. Equity-classified awards are valued as of the grant date based upon the price of the underlying unit or share and a number of assumptions, including volatility, performance period, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Liability-classified awards are valued at fair value at each reporting date. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 We comply with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ), which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances in respect of deferred tax assets are provided for, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be realized. 
 
 ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition. Any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be recognized as a component of income tax expense. 
 
 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have a material impact on our financial statement presentation or disclosures. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Accounting Election 
 
 Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can choose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, and any such election to not take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and has elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. The Company remains an emerging growth company and is expected to continue to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period. This may make it difficult or impossible to compare the Company financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions for emerging growth companies because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 

33

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item 3. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, we did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures at the reasonable assurance level, as described below. 

During 2022, certain issues were identified that indicated the existence of deficiencies in the Company s internal ability to prepare consolidated financial statements, reflecting material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

During 2023, the Company expanded its financial and accounting staff, which included adding a Chief Financial Officer, a Controller, a Director of Accounting and Financial Reporting, as well as requisite supporting staff. As a result, the Company believes that it has adequate staff resources to address accounting and reporting requirements under U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting standards, and to implement internal controls. 

The Company has retained the services of qualified outside consultants with expertise to perform specific accounting and finance tasks or functions, and to assist in the design and installation of accounting and internal control systems. The Company has not yet completed the process to establish adequate internal controls over financial reporting, and it expects that this process will continue through the remainder of 2024, and possibly longer. 

While the deficiencies described above did not result in any material misstatements to the Company s condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements for the period ending September 30, 2024, they did represent a material weakness as of September 30, 2024, since there existed a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Management s Remediation Measures 
 
 Management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. Accordingly, management is in the process of implementing a plan to remediate the material weakness described above as soon as possible. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except as described above, there were no significant changes in the internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting. 

34

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, management does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or the internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Company may be subject to claims and litigation. The Company reviews its legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections, and other legal matters on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions are required. If necessary, the Company establishes accruals for those contingencies when the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and the Company discloses the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. The Company does not record an accrual when the likelihood of loss being incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, or when the loss is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote, although disclosures will be made for material matters as required by ASC 450-20, Contingencies. 
 
 The Company had certain pending or threatened legal claims or actions in which there was a probable outcome. Ellmount Entertainment, Ltd., a subsidiary of the Company, has litigation pending in Austria and Germany regarding player claims and related legal fees. The Company currently is not targeting these markets and does not anticipate further claims of a similar nature that may be material in these markets. The Company is also currently subject to administrative claims initiated by the Czech Ministry of Finance regarding the operation of gaming activities in 2018 without a license and has been ordered to pay a fine of approximately 216 thousand, which is under appeal. The Company is not currently aware of any other material regulatory or tax claims. The Company has provided appropriate provision for these claims in accrued expenses in its consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and 2022 to the extent that such claims can be reasonably estimated. See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should also carefully review and consider the risk factors contained in our other registration statements, reports and periodic filings with the SEC that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors we have identified and discussed, however, do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.
