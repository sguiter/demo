FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on our current expectations and estimates, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 our future operating results; 
 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 
 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 
 the impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our business; 
 the impact of increased competition; 
 an economic downturn and its impact on the ability of our portfolio companies to operate and the investment opportunities available to us; 
 the impact of interest rate volatility on our business and our portfolio companies; 
 the impact of supply chain constraints and labor difficulties on our portfolio companies and the global economy; 
 the level of inflation, and its impact on our portfolio companies and on the industries in which we invest; 
 the impact of geopolitical conditions, including the conflict between Ukraine and Russia and in the Middle East, and their impact on financial market volatility, global economic markets, and various sectors, industries and markets for commodities globally, such as oil and natural gas; 
 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 the valuation of our investments in portfolio companies, particularly those having no liquid trading market; 
 actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Advisers, and/or their respective affiliates; 
 the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 
 the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments; 
 the adequacy of our financing sources and working capital; 
 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies;

 1 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this report. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements except as otherwise provided by law.

 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when a payment default occurs or if management otherwise believes that the issuer of the loan will not be able to make contractual interest payments or principal payments. The Company will cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal and interest is current through payment or until a restructuring occurs, such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. However, the Company remains contractually entitled to this interest. The Company may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. Accrued interest is written-off when it becomes probable that the interest will not be collected and the amount of uncollectible interest can be reasonably estimated.

 First-Lien Debt in the amount of , Subordinated Debt in the amount of and equity investments in the amount of at December 31, 2023 have been excluded from the table above, because the investments are valued using a recent transaction. 
 Debt investments are generally valued using the yield method. Under the yield method, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to the expected life, portfolio company performance since close, and other terms and risks associated with an investment. Among other factors, a determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to its total enterprise value, and the rights and remedies of the Company s investment within the portfolio company s capital structure. Debt investments may also be valued using a market approach, The market approach utilizes market value (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. Certain factors are considered when selecting the appropriate companies whose multiples are used in the valuation. These factors may include the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued and, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. A recent transaction, if applicable, also may be factored into the valuation if the transaction price is believed to be an indicator of value. 
 Equity investments are generally valued using a market approach, which utilizes market value (EBITDA or revenue) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The selected multiple is used to estimate the enterprise value of the underlying investment. 
 
 The significant unobservable input used under the yield method is a discount rate based on comparable market yields. Significant increases in discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. The significant unobservable input used in the market approach is the performance multiple, which may include a revenue multiple, EBITDA multiple, or forward-looking metrics. The multiple is used to estimate the enterprise value of the underlying investment. An increase or decrease in the multiple would result in an increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value.

of the daily weighted average principal amount of the Liquid Investments managed by Nuveen Asset Management pursuant to the NAM Sub-Advisory Agreement. The fees payable to Nuveen Asset Management pursuant to the NAM Sub-Advisory Agreement will not impact the advisory fees payable by the Company's shareholders. 
 Advisory agreements remain in effect for an initial period of and will remain in effect on a year-to-year basis thereafter if approved annually either by the Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of our Independent Directors.

The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities may also terminate any of the Advisory Agreements without penalty. 
 Compensation of the Adviser - Management Fee 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, for the first five quarters beginning with the calendar quarter in which the IPO was consummated (i.e., beginning with the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2024 through the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2025), the management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of average total assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents and including assets financed using leverage Average Total Assets ), at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and thereafter, the management fee will step up to of Average Total Assets. For purposes of this calculation, cash and cash equivalents include any temporary investments in cash-equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality investment grade debt investments that mature in 12 months or less from the date of investment. Any management fees will be payable quarterly in arrears. 
 Compensation of the Adviser - Incentive Fee 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is waiving the incentive fee on income and incentive fee on capital gains for the first five quarters beginning with the calendar quarter in which the IPO was consummated (i.e., beginning with the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2024 through the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2025). Following the expiration of the fee waiver, the Company will pay an incentive fee to the Adviser that will consist of two parts. The incentive fees will be based on income and capital gains, each as described below. The portion of the incentive fee based on income will be calculated, subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ), and payable quarterly in arrears based on pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the current calendar quarter and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (or, if fewer, the number of calendar quarters beginning with the calendar quarter in which the IPO was consummated) (such period, the Trailing Twelve Quarters commencing from the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the IPO was consummated, as follows: 
 no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income (as defined below) in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters does not exceed the hurdle rate of annually) for such Trailing Twelve Quarters;

 (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data) 

of our aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than in any calendar quarter following the consummation of the IPO. The Company refers to this portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as the catch-up provision. The catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds multiplied by our NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters; and 
 of the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters that exceeds . 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, the incentive fee on income for a particular quarter will be subject to the Incentive Fee Cap. The Incentive Fee Cap will be equal to the difference between (x) of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) over the Trailing Twelve Quarters and (y) the aggregate incentive fee on income that was paid to the Adviser by the Company in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or, if fewer, the number of calendar quarters beginning with the calendar quarter in which the IPO was consummated) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. These calculations will be adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable calendar quarter. 
 
 Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters, beginning with the calendar quarter in which the IPO was consummated, means (x) the pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters less (y) any Net Capital Loss (as defined below), if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company will pay no incentive fee on income to the Adviser in respect of that quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the incentive fee on income that is payable to the Adviser for such quarter calculated as described above, the Company will pay an incentive fee on income to the Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee Cap in respect of such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the incentive fee on income that is payable to the Adviser for such quarter calculated as described above, the Company will pay an incentive fee on income to the Adviser equal to the incentive fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap. 
 
 Net Capital Loss in respect of a particular period, beginning with the calendar quarter in which the IPO was consummated, means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in respect of such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in respect of such period. 
 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the relevant calendar quarters, minus operating expenses for the relevant calendar quarters (including the management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income will include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred shares with PIK dividends and zero-coupon securities, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. The Adviser is not under any obligation to reimburse the Company for any part of the incentive fee it received that was based on accrued interest that the Company never received. Pre-incentive fee net investment income will not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. If any distributions from portfolio companies are characterized as a return of capital, such returns of capital would affect the capital gains incentive fee to the extent a gain or loss is realized. 
 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, the second part of the incentive fee will be a capital gains incentive fee that will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals of our realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year following the IPO. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Advisers Act, including Section 205 thereof.

Share Repurchase Plan 
 
 On March 5, 2024, the Company entered into a share repurchase plan (the Company 10b5-1 Plan ), pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to in the aggregate of its outstanding shares of common stock in the open market at prices below its NAV per share over a specified period. Any purchase of the shares pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan are conducted in accordance with the guidelines and conditions of Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The Company adopted the Company 10b5-1 Plan because it believes that, if its common stock is trading below its then-current NAV per share, it will be in the best interest of its stockholders for the Company to reinvest in its portfolio. 
 
 The Company 10b5-1 Plan is designed to allow the Company to repurchase its shares of common stock at times when the Company otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires BofA Securities, Inc., as agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on the Company's behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported NAV per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by the Company to any previously announced NAV per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of the shares of the Company's common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any share repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of the shares of the Company's common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of shares of the common stock will be repurchased. 
 
 The purchase of shares of common stock pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan is intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and will otherwise be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M, which may prohibit purchases under certain circumstances. 
 
 The Company 10b5-1 Plan became effective on March 29, 2024 and commenced on April 1, 2024. The 10b5-1 Plan will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) 12-months from the effective date (tolled for periods during which the Company 10b5-1 Plan is suspended), (ii) the end of the trading day on which the aggregate purchase price for all shares of common stock purchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan equals and (iii) the occurrence of certain other events described in the Company 10b5-1 Plan.

This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements. 
 
 Overview 
 We were formed on March 13, 2018 as a Delaware limited liability company and converted into a Maryland corporation on June 18, 2019, prior to the commencement of operations. We are a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). In addition, we have elected, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). 
 Our investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns primarily through current income by investing primarily in senior secured loans to private equity-owned U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies with approximately 10 million to 250 million of annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ). We primarily focus on investing in U.S. middle market companies, with 10 million to 100 million in EBITDA, which we consider the core middle market. Our portfolio is comprised primarily of first-lien senior secured debt and unitranche loans. Although it is not our primary strategy, we also opportunistically invest in junior capital opportunities, including second-lien loans, subordinated debt, and equity co-investments and similar equity-related securities. 
 We have entered into an investment advisory agreement (as amended and restated, the Advisory Agreement with Churchill DLC Advisor LLC (f/k/a Nuveen Churchill Advisors LLC) (the Adviser ), under which the Adviser has delegated substantially all of its day-to-day portfolio management obligations through a sub-advisory agreement (as amended and restated, the CAM Sub-Advisory Agreement to Churchill Asset Management LLC Churchill ). In addition, the Adviser and Churchill have engaged Nuveen Asset Management, LLC Nuveen Asset Management and together with the Adviser and Churchill, the "Advisers") pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement (the "NAM Sub-Advisory Agreement"), pursuant to which Nuveen Asset Management may manage a portion of our portfolio consisting of cash and cash equivalents, liquid fixed-income securities (including broadly syndicated loans) and other liquid credit instruments, subject to the pace and amount of investment activity in the middle market investment program. Under the administration agreement (the Administration Agreement ), we are provided with certain services by an administrator, Churchill BDC Administration LLC (f/k/a Nuveen Churchill Administration LLC) (the Administrator ). The Adviser, Churchill, Nuveen Asset Management and Administrator are all affiliates and subsidiaries of Nuveen, LLC Nuveen ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America TIAA ). 
 Churchill NCDLC CLO-I, LLC CLO-I ), Churchill NCDLC CLO-II, LLC CLO-II ), Churchill NCDLC CLO-III, LLC CLO-III ), Nuveen Churchill BDC SPV IV, LLC SPV IV ), Nuveen Churchill BDC SPV V, LLC SPV V and NCDL Equity Holdings LLC ("NCDL Equity Holdings") are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company and are consolidated in these financial statements commencing from the date of their formation. CLO-I, CLO-II and CLO-III completed term debt securitizations in May 2022, December 2023 and March 2024, respectively. SPV IV and SPV V primarily invest in first-lien senior secured debt and unitranche loans. NCDL Equity Holdings was formed to hold certain equity-related securities. 
 Beginning with our initial closing in March 2020, we conducted private offerings ("Private Offerings") of our shares of common stock to accredited investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). We held our final closing on April 28, 2023. 
 On January 29, 2024, we closed our initial public offering IPO and our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the symbol NCDL on January 25, 2024.

Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity varies substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount we have available to invest as well as the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity in the middle market, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. To the extent we continue to qualify as a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S federal income tax on any income we timely distribute to our shareholders. 
 As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we are generally required to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. 
 As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Under the 1940 Act, the term eligible portfolio company includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than 250.0 million. In addition, we must be organized in the United States to qualify as a BDC. 
 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, and capital gains on the sales of loans or debt and equity securities. Our debt investments generally bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). Interest on these debt investments is generally paid quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity dates. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also may reflect the proceeds of sales of securities. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, consulting or prepayment fees associated with our investment activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered by us to portfolio companies and other investment related income.

 1 Gross commitments at par includes unfunded investment commitments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our debt portfolio reflected the following characteristics, based on fair value: 
 Weighted average reported annual EBITDA of 76.8 million. 1 
 Weighted average of 2.1x interest coverage ratio for our first-lien loans 2 
 Weighted average of 4.85x net leverage. 3 
 Approximately 83 of our debt investments have financial covenants. 4 
 ________________________________________ 
 1 These calculations include all private debt investments for which fair value is determined by the Adviser in its capacity as the Valuation Designee of the Company's board of directors (the Board ), and excludes quoted assets. Amounts are weighted based on fair market value of each respective investment as of its most recent quarterly valuation, which are derived from the most recently available portfolio company financial statements. 
 84 

2 The interest coverage ratio calculation is derived from the most recently available portfolio company financial information received by the Adviser, and is a weighted average based on the fair market value of each respective first lien loan investment as of its most recent reporting to lenders. Such reporting may include assumptions regarding the impact of interest rate hedges established by borrowers to reduce their exposure to floating interest rates (resulting in a reduced hedging rate being used for the total interest expense in respect of such hedges, rather than any higher rates applicable under the documentation for such loans), even if such hedging instruments are not pledged as collateral to lenders in respect of such loans and do not secure the loans themselves. The interest rate coverage ratio excludes junior capital investments and equity co-investments, and applies solely to traditional middle market first lien loans held by us, which also excludes any upper middle market or other first lien loans investments that do not have maintenance financial covenants, and first lien loans that the Adviser has assigned a risk rating of 8 or higher, as well as any portfolio companies with net senior leverage of 15x or greater. As a result of the foregoing exclusions, the interest coverage ratio shown herein applies to 73.99 of our total investments, and 82.15 of our total first lien loan investments, in each case based upon fair value. 
 3 Net leverage is the ratio of total debt minus cash divided by EBITDA, taking into account only the debt issued through the tranche in which we are a lender. Leverage is derived from the most recently available portfolio company financial statements, and weighted by the fair value of each investment. Net leverage presented excludes equity investments as well as debt instruments to which the Adviser has assigned a risk rating of 8 or higher, and any portfolio companies with net leverage of 15x or greater. 
 4 Represents the percentage of debt investments with one or more maintenance financial covenants.

 The weighted average yields of our investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Weighted average yield on debt and income producing investments, at cost 1 
 10.86 11.72 Weighted average yield on debt and income producing investments, at fair value 2 
 10.94 11.94 Percentage of debt investments bearing a floating rate 94.25 94.61 Percentage of debt investments bearing a fixed rate 5.75 5.39 
 _____________________ 
 1 Weighted average yield inclusive of debt and income producing investments on non-accrual status, at cost, as of September 30, 2024 was 10.70 . There were no investments on non-accrual as of December 31, 2023. 
 2 Weighted average yield inclusive of debt and income producing investments on non-accrual status, at fair value, as of September 30, 2024 was 10.87 . There were no investments on non-accrual as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 93.83 and 93.93 of our debt and income producing investments at cost and at fair value, respectively, had interest rate floors that govern the minimum applicable interest rates on such loans. As of December 31, 2023, 94.43 and 94.55 of our debt and income producing investments at cost and at fair value, respectively, had interest rate floors that govern the minimum applicable interest rates on such loans. 
 
 86 

The weighted average yield of our debt and income producing securities is not the same as a return on investment for our shareholders, but rather relates to our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of each respective date, including accretion of original issue discount, but excluding any investments on non-accrual status, if any. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level. Total weighted average yields of our debt and income producing investments, at cost, decreased from 11.72 to 10.86 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The decrease in weighted average yields was primarily due to the tightening of spreads in newly originated investments made year to date in 2024. We also saw an increase in repricing transactions for existing portfolio investments in the first three quarters of 2024. 
 
 As financial markets stabilize and private equity firms become more active in an effort to deploy dry powder and return capital to their investors we are seeing private equity mergers and acquisitions ("M A") volumes increase, leading to higher levels of demand for middle-market financings. Prepayment activity is also increasing as a result, driven primarily by M A activity, but also in part by repricing and refinancing while spreads continue to tighten. While prepayments serve as an offset to new transaction activity, we believe that lenders who are well positioned with available liquidity as well as incumbent positions in portfolio companies will benefit from increased levels of activity in the market. 
 Keeping the macro-economic environment in mind, we are closely monitoring the impacts to our portfolio companies, and we will continue to seek to invest in defensive businesses with low levels of cyclicality and strong levels of free cash flow generation. While we are not seeing signs of a broad-based deterioration in our performance or that of our portfolio companies at this time, there can be no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our future results. 
 Asset Quality 
 In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, we use the Advisers investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. Churchill, in its capacity as sub-adviser, utilizes a systematic, consistent approach to credit evaluation, with a particular focus on an acceptable level of debt repayment and deleveraging under a base case set of projections (the Base Case ), which reflects a more conservative estimate than the set of projections provided by a prospective portfolio company (the Management Case ). The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 
 1. Performing - Superior: Borrower is performing significantly above Management Case. 
 2. Performing - High: Borrower is performing at or near the Management Case (i.e., in a range slightly below to slightly above). 
 3. Performing - Low Risk: Borrower is operating well ahead of the Base Case to slightly below the Management Case. 
 4. Performing - Stable Risk: Borrower is operating at or near the Base Case (i.e., in a range slightly below to slightly above). This is the initial rating assigned to all new borrowers. 
 5. Performing - Management Notice: Borrower is operating below the Base Case. Adverse trends in business conditions and/or industry outlook are viewed as temporary. There is no immediate risk of payment default and only a low to moderate risk of covenant default. 
 6. Watch List - Low Maintenance: Borrower is operating below the Base Case, with declining margin of protection. Adverse trends in business conditions and/or industry outlook are viewed as probably lasting for more than a year. Payment default is still considered unlikely, but there is a moderate to high risk of covenant default. 
 7. Watch List - Medium Maintenance: Borrower is operating well below the Base Case, but has adequate liquidity. Adverse trends are more pronounced than in Internal Risk Rating 6 above. There is a high risk of covenant default, or it may have already occurred. Payments are current, although subject to greater uncertainty, and there is a moderate to high risk of payment default. 
 8. Watch List - High Maintenance: Borrower is operating well below the Base Case. Liquidity may be strained. Covenant default is imminent or may have occurred. Payments are current, but there is a high risk of payment default. Negotiations to restructure or refinance debt on normal terms may have begun. Further significant deterioration appears unlikely and no loss of principal is currently anticipated. 
 9. Watch List - Possible Loss: At the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Liquidity is strained. Payment default may have occurred or is very likely in the short term unless creditors grant some relief. Loss of principal is possible. 
 87 

10. Watch List - Probable Loss: At the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Payment default is very likely or may have already occurred. Liquidity is extremely limited. The prospects for improvement in the borrower s situation are sufficiently negative that loss of some or all principal is probable. 
 Churchill regularly monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment rating assigned to each investment in our portfolio. Each investment team will review the investment ratings in connection with monthly or quarterly portfolio reviews. 
 The following table shows the investment ratings of the investments in our portfolio (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Fair Value of Portfolio Number of Portfolio Companies Fair Value of Portfolio Number of Portfolio Companies 1 2 3 126,013 6.16 9 80,342 4.89 7 4 1,690,401 82.58 157 1,353,243 82.44 140 5 115,092 5.62 19 138,916 8.46 21 6 56,683 2.77 8 35,686 2.17 6 7 47,007 2.30 6 27,653 1.68 4 8 2,341 0.11 1 5,846 0.36 1 9 10 9,350 0.46 2 Total 2,046,887 100.00 202 1,641,686 100.00 179 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average Internal Risk Rating of our investment portfolio. at fair value, was 4.15 and 4.14, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there were three portfolio companies on non-accrual. As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost of the portfolio companies on non-accrual status were 29.1 million, which represents approximately 1.40 of total investments at amortized cost. As of December 31, 2023, there were no loans on non-accrual. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (dollars amounts in thousands):

 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, expenses, the recognition of realized gains and losses, and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. 
 Investment income 
 Investment income, attributable to interest and fees on our debt investments, increased to 60.3 million and 167.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 41.7 million and 112.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 respectively, primarily due to increased investment activity driven by an increase in our deployed capital, slightly offset by a decrease in the weighted average yield of our debt and income producing investments as a result of market spread tightening and a decline in SOFR. As of September 30, 2024, the size of our portfolio increased to 2.1 billion from 1.5 billion as of September 30, 2023, at cost. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average yield of our debt and income 
 89 

producing investments decreased to 10.86 from 11.60 as of September 30, 2023 on cost, primarily due to overall tightening of spreads in newly originated investments, the refinancing and repricing of existing portfolio companies, and the decline in base interest rates. Shifting base interest rates, such as SOFR and any applicable alternate rates, may affect our investment income in the future. 
 Expenses 
 Total expenses before expense support and waived incentive fees increased to 34.3 million and 87.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 20.1 million and 54.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Interest and debt financing expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher average daily borrowings, higher average interest rates, the use of the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) in the third quarter of 2023 and the completion of the 2023 Debt Securitization and the 2024 Debt Securitization (each as defined below) on December 7, 2023 and March 14, 2024, respectively. The average daily borrowings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,156.7 million and 974.7 million, respectively, compared to 819.0 million and 777.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The average annual interest rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.74 and 7.70 , respectively, compared to 7.51 and 7.17 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The increases in management fees increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable periods in 2023 were driven by increases in our total assets. Incentive fees based on income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 5.5 million and 13.0 million, respectively, were waived in accordance with our Advisory Agreement. 
 Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, valuation, and other professional fees incurred related to the management of us. Administrative fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of the our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer, and their respective staffs. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, rating agencies, subscriptions and other costs. The increases in professional, administration, and other general and administrative fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable periods in 2023 was primarily driven by growing needs of the business given the increase in the Company's size year over year. 
 The expense support amount represents the amount of expenses paid by the Adviser on our behalf in accordance with the Expense Support Agreement (described further below). These expenses were primarily related to professional fees, specifically ordinary course legal expenses incurred by the Company. The Expense Support Agreement automatically terminated pursuant to its terms upon the consummation of the IPO. Refer to the "Related Party Transactions" section below for further details on the Expense Support Agreement. 
 Net realized gain (loss) and Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net realized gain on investments of 1.1 million compared to a net realized loss of (13.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net realized gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by full or partial repayments and sales of certain of our investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net realized loss on investments of (1.5) million, compared to a net realized loss of (6.4) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net realized loss the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a final realization of an underperforming debt position which generated a realized loss in the first quarter of 2024, offset by realized gains in the second and third quarters of 2024. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net change in unrealized gain of 4.1 million, which resulted from an increase in fair value primarily attributable to market spread tightening and net positive credit performance of our portfolio companies in the third quarter of 2024. We recorded a net change in unrealized loss of (4.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted from a decrease in fair value of two underperforming portfolio companies in the second quarter of 2024, offset by unrealized gains driven primarily from a reversal of unrealized losses on certain of our underperforming debt positions that were ultimately realized in the first quarter of 2024 and the overall tightening in market spreads. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net unrealized gain of 11.6 million primarily attributable to modest softening of certain of our portfolio companies' credit metrics partially offset by tightening in market spreads. We recorded a net unrealized loss of (3.8) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to modest softening of certain of our portfolio companies' credit metrics.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Due to the diverse capital resources available to us at this time, we believe we have adequate liquidity to support our near-term capital requirements. Our liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from cash flows from income earned from our investments and principal repayments, and our net borrowings from our credit facilities and CLO debt issuances (discussed further below). Prior to our IPO on January 29, 2024, we also generated cash flow from the proceeds of capital drawdowns of our privately placed capital commitments. In the future, we may also generate cash flow from future offerings of securities including issuances of debt and/or equity securities through both public registered offerings using a shelf registration statement and private offerings. Due to an uncertain economic outlook and current market volatility, we regularly evaluate our overall liquidity position and take proactive steps to maintain that position based on such circumstances. The primary uses of our cash are (i) purchases of investments in portfolio companies, (ii) funding the cost of our operations (including fees paid to our Adviser), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of our borrowings, (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our shares, and (v) share repurchases under the Company 10b5-1 Plan (defined below). 
 We are generally permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our shares if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150 , if certain requirements are met. In connection with our organization, our Board and TIAA (as our initial shareholder) authorized us to adopt the 150 asset coverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 189.89 and 178.57 , respectively. 
 Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, taken together with the availability under our credit facilities, are expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of September 30, 2024, we had 130.0 million available under our Wells Fargo Financing Facility (as defined below), 24.2 million available under our SMBC Financing Facility (as defined below), and 137.3 million available under our SMBC Corporate Revolver (as defined below), subject to asset coverage limitations. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by 1.9 million. During that period, 309.2 million was used in operating activities, primarily relating to investment purchases of 712.5 million, offset by 310.5 million in repayments and sales of investments in portfolio companies. During the same period, 311.1 million was provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of proceeds from issuance of common shares and secured borrowings of 241.7 million and 717.8 million, respectively, net of shareholder distributions and repayments of secured borrowings of 67.4 million and 567.7 million, respectively. 
 
 Equity 
 Our authorized stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of stock, par value 0.01 per share, all of which are initially designated as common stock. 
 IPO and Private Offerings 
 On January 29, 2024, we closed our IPO, issuing 5,500,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of 18.05 per share. We received total cash proceeds of 99.3 million. Our common stock began trading on the NYSE under the symbol NCDL on January 25, 2024. 
 Prior to April 28, 2023, in connection with our Private Offerings, we entered into subscription agreements Subscription Agreements with investors, pursuant to which investors were required to fund drawdowns to purchase our shares of common stock up to the amount of their respective capital commitment each time we delivered a drawdown notice. Following the final drawdown notice dated December 21, 2023 and due on January 5, 2024, all capital commitments had been drawn.

 Dividends and Distributions 
 To the extent that we have taxable income, we intend to make quarterly distributions to our common shareholders. Dividends and distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the applicable record date. The amount to be distributed to common shareholders is determined by our Board each quarter and is generally based upon the taxable earnings estimated by management and available cash. Net realized capital gains, if any, will generally be distributed at least annually, although we may decide to retain such capital gains for investment. 
 In connection with the IPO, our Board approved an amended and restated dividend reinvestment plan (the "Amended DRIP"), which became effective on January 29, 2024, concurrent with the consummation of the IPO. 
 
 The Amended DRIP changed the dividend reinvestment plan from an opt in dividend reinvestment plan to an opt out dividend reinvestment plan. As a result of the foregoing, if our Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or distribution, shareholders that acquired their shares in the IPO and do not opt out of the Amended DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares rather than receiving cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a shareholder s election (or deemed election) under the dividend reinvestment plan, dated December 19, 2019, will remain in effect for such shareholder and no further action is required by such shareholder with respect to their election under the Amended DRIP. 
 
 With respect to each distribution under the Amended DRIP, our Board reserves the right to either issue new shares of common stock or purchase shares of common stock in the open market for the accounts of participants in the Amended DRIP. If newly issued shares are used to implement the Amended DRIP, the number of shares to be issued to a shareholder will be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such participant by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading of the NYSE on the distribution payment date, or if no sale is reported for such day, the average of the reported bid and asked prices. However, if the market price per share on the distribution payment date exceeds the most recently computed NAV per share, we will issue shares at the greater of (i) the most recently computed NAV per share and (ii) 95 of the current market price per share (or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeds the most recently computed NAV per share). If shares are purchased in the open market to implement the Amended DRIP, the number of shares to be issued to a participant will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the distribution payable to such participant by the weighted 
 92 

average price per share for all shares of common stock purchased by the plan administrator in the open market in connection with the dividend or distribution. Although each participant may from time to time have an undivided fractional interest in a share, no certificates for a fractional share will be issued. However, dividends and distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participant s account.

The distributions declared were derived from investment company taxable income and net capital gain, if any. The federal income tax characterization of distributions declared and paid for the fiscal year will be determined at fiscal year-end based upon our investment company taxable income for the full fiscal year and distributions paid during the full year.

 Share Repurchase Plan 
 On March 5, 2024, we entered into a share repurchase plan (the Company 10b5-1 Plan ), pursuant to which we may purchase up to 99.3 million in the aggregate of its outstanding shares of common stock in the open market at prices below its net asset value NAV per share over a specified period. Any purchase of the shares pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines and conditions of Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We adopted the Company 10b5-1 Plan because we believes that, if our common stock is trading below its then-current NAV per share, it will be in the best interest of its stockholders for us to reinvest in our portfolio. 
 
 The Company 10b5-1 Plan is designed to allow us to repurchase our shares of common stock at times when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires BofA Securities, Inc., as agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on the Company's behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported NAV per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by us to any previously announced NAV per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of the shares of the our common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any share repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of the shares of our common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of shares of the common stock will be repurchased. 
 
 The purchase of shares of common stock pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan is intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and will otherwise be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M, which may prohibit purchases under certain circumstances. 
 
 The Company 10b5-1 Plan became effective on March 29, 2024 and commenced on April 1, 2024. The 10b5-1 Plan will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) 12-months from the effective date (tolled for periods during which the Company 10b5-1 Plan 
 94 

is suspended), (ii) the end of the trading day on which the aggregate purchase price for all shares of common stock purchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan equals 99.3 million and (iii) the occurrence of certain other events described in the Company 10b5-1 Plan. 

The following table reflects the shares repurchased pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan for each month from inception through September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data):

 Shareholder Transfer Restrictions 
 
 With respect to any shares of common stock held by a shareholder prior to the date of the IPO prospectus (January 24, 2024), without the prior written consent of the Board: 
 
 for 365 days following the date of the IPO prospectus (January 24, 2024), a shareholder that is affiliated with the Advisers is not permitted to transfer (whether by sale, gift, merger, by operation of law or otherwise), exchange, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber any shares of common stock held by such shareholder prior January 24, 2024; 
 
 for 90 days following the date of the date of the IPO prospectus (January 24, 2024), a shareholder (other than certain individuals and entities affiliated with the Advisers, who are subject to the 365-day restriction above) is not permitted to transfer (whether by sale, gift, merger, by operation of law or otherwise), exchange, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber any shares of common stock held by such shareholder prior to January 24, 2024; 
 
 beginning with the 91st day following the date of the IPO prospectus (January 24, 2024) through the 180th day following the date of the IPO prospectus (January 24, 2024), a shareholder (other than certain individuals and entities affiliated with the Advisers, who are subject to the 365-day restriction above) is not permitted to transfer (whether by sale, gift, merger, by operation of law or otherwise), exchange, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber 85 of the shares of common stock held by such shareholder prior to January 24, 2024; and 
 
 beginning with the 181st day following the date of the IPO prospectus (January 24, 2024) through the 270th day following the date of the IPO prospectus (January 24, 2024), a shareholder (other than certain individuals and entities affiliated with the Advisers, who are subject to the 365-day restriction above) is not permitted to transfer (whether by sale, gift, merger, by operation of law or otherwise), exchange, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber 50 of the shares of common stock held by such shareholder prior to January 24, 2024. 
 
 Beginning with the 271st day following the date of the IPO prospectus (January 24, 2024), a shareholder (other than certain individuals and entities affiliated with the Advisers, who are subject to the 365-day restriction above) may transfer (whether by sale, gift, merger, by operation of law or otherwise), exchange, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber all of the shares of common stock held by such shareholder prior to the date of the IPO. 
 
 This means that, as a result of these transfer restrictions, without the consent of the Board, a shareholder (other than certain individuals and entities affiliated with the Advisers, who are subject to the 365-day restriction above) who owned 100 shares of common stock on January 24, 2024 could not sell any of such shares for 90 days following January 24, 2024; 91 days following 
 95 

January 24, 2024, such shareholder could only sell up to 15 of such shares; 181 days following January 24, 2024, such shareholder could only sell up to 50 of such shares; 271 days following January 24, 2024, such shareholder could sell all of such shares. 
 Income Taxes 
 
 We have elected and intend to qualify annually to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Code. If we qualify as a RIC, we will not be taxed on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed, or deemed to be distributed, to shareholders on a timely basis. 
 Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized. Dividends declared and paid by us in a year may differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income or the distribution of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the current year. Distributions also may include returns of capital. 
 To qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute, with respect to each taxable year, at least 90 of our investment company net taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any). If we qualify as a RIC, we may also be subject to a U.S. federal excise tax, based on distribution requirements of our taxable income on a calendar year basis. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next year and pay a 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such income. Any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year that generated such taxable income. 
 We intend to distribute to our shareholders between 90 and 100 of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income). We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. We cannot assure shareholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.

Secured Borrowings 
 See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our secured borrowings. 
 Subscription Facility 
 On September 10, 2020, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Subscription Facility Agreement and the facility thereunder, the Subscription Facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation SMBC ), as the administrative agent for certain secured parties, the syndication agent, the lead arranger, the book manager, the letter of credit issuer and the lender. The Subscription Facility had a maximum commitment of 50 million, subject to availability under the "Borrowing Base." The Borrowing Base was calculated based on the unfunded capital commitments of certain investors that had subscribed to purchase shares of the Company, to the extent the capital commitments of such investors also had been approved by SMBC for inclusion in the Borrowing base and met certain additional criteria. The Subscription Facility Agreement expired on September 8, 2023, and we fully paid down the outstanding balance including the accrued interest expense. 
 Wells Fargo Financing Facility 
 On December 31, 2019, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a credit agreement ("the Wells Fargo Financing Facility and the agreement relating thereto, as amended from time to time, the Wells Fargo Financing Facility Agreement ), with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as lender Wells Fargo and administrative agent. The Wells Fargo Financing Facility Agreement was amended on October 28, 2020, March 31, 2022, March 14, 2024 and August 27, 2024. The most recent amendment on August 27, 2024, among other things, increased the maximum facility amount available from 150 million to 225 million. 
 The Wells Fargo Financing Facility reinvestment period expires on March 31, 2025 and has a maturity date of March 31, 2027. The Wells Fargo Financing Facility Agreement also requires the Company to maintain an asset coverage ratio equal to at least 1.50:1.00. The amount of the borrowings under the Wells Fargo Financing Facility equals the amount of the outstanding advances. Advances under the Wells Fargo Financing Facility may be prepaid and reborrowed at any time during the reinvestment period, but any termination or reduction of the facility amount prior to the first anniversary of the date of the amendment (subject to certain exceptions) is subject to a commitment reduction fee of 1 . Under the Wells Fargo Financing Facility Agreement, we paid a fee on daily undrawn amounts under the Wells Fargo Financing Facility of 0.25 per annum during the period ended June 14, 2024. For the six months following June 14, 2024, the Company pays a fee on daily undrawn amounts under the Wells Fargo Facility of 0.50 per annum. and, thereafter, will pay 0.50 per annum on undrawn amounts of up to 40 of the maximum facility amount and 1.50 per annum on undrawn amounts in excess of 40 of the maximum facility amount. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Wells Fargo Financing Facility bore interest at a rate of SOFR, reset daily, plus 2.20 per annum. 
 On March 14, 2024, SPV V entered into the borrower joinder agreement to become party to the Wells Fargo Financing Facility Agreement and pledged all of its assets to the collateral agent to secure their obligations under the Wells Fargo Financing Facility. The Company, and SPV V have made customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various financial covenants related to liquidity and other maintenance covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar facilities. 
 SMBC Financing Facility 
 On November 24, 2020, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the SMBC Financing Facility and the agreement relating thereto the SMBC Financing Facility Agreement with SMBC, as the administrative agent, the collateral agent and the lender. On October 19, 2023, SPV IV entered into the borrower joinder agreement (the SMBC Joinder to become party to the SMBC Financing Facility Agreement. 
 97 

The SMBC Financing Facility Agreement was amended on December 23, 2021, June 29, 2022 and November 21, 2023. The most recent amendment on November 21, 2023 (the "SMBC Financing Facility Amendment"), among other things: (i) extended the reinvestment period from November 24, 2023 to November 24, 2024 and the stated maturity date from November 24, 2025 to November 24, 2026; (ii) changed the interest rate for loans under the SMBC Financing Facility Agreement from (A) either the Base Rate (as defined in the SMBC Financing Facility Agreement) plus 1.15 or the Term SOFR (as defined in the SMBC Financing Facility Agreement) plus 2.15 to (B) either the Base Rate plus 1.65 or Term SOFR plus 2.65 ; (iii) reduced the maximum facility amount from 300 million to 150 million upon the occurrence of a permitted securitization, subject to a subsequent increase to 250 million, in the sole discretion of the administrative agent, if so requested by the borrowers; and (iv) provide for an unused commitment fee of, from the three month anniversary of the SMBC Financing Facility Amendment date to the six month anniversary of the Amendment date, 0.50 per annum on the unused commitments and on or after the six month anniversary of the SMBC Financing Facility Amendment date, 0.50 per annum on the unused commitments if such unused commitments are less than 50 of the total commitments and 1.00 per annum on the unused commitments if such unused commitments are greater than or equal to 50 of the total commitments. In connection with the SMBC Financing Facility Amendment, the borrowers paid an extension fee of 450 thousand plus an annualized fee of 0.30 multiplied by 150 million based on the length of time (in years) until the occurrence of a permitted securitization. Advances under the SMBC Financing Facility Agreement may be prepaid and reborrowed at any time during the reinvestment period. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the SMBC Financing Facility bore interest at one-month SOFR plus 2.65 and one-month SOFR plus 2.65 , respectively, per annum. 
 Effective December 7, 2023, following the closing of the 2023 Debt Securitization (discussed further below), the maximum facility amount available was reduced to 150 million from 300 million and SPV IV began borrowing under the SMBC Financing Facility. 
 SPV IV, beginning October 19, 2023, has pledged all of its assets to the collateral agent to secure its obligations under the SMBC Financing Facility. The Company and SPV IV have made customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various financial covenants related to liquidity and other maintenance covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar facilities. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On June 23, 2023, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement (the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement and facility thereunder, the Revolving Credit Facility and together with the Wells Fargo Financing Facility and SMBC Financing Facility, the Financing Facilities with SMBC as the lender, administrative agent, and one of the lead arrangers along with Wells Fargo. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by NCDL Equity Holdings and will be guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries that are formed or acquired in the future (collectively, the Guarantors ). 
 The Revolving Credit Facility was amended on April 9, 2024. The amendment, among other things, increased the maximum principal amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility from 185 million to 250 million pursuant to the accordion feature, subject to availability under the borrowing base,, subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on our portfolio investments and other outstanding indebtedness. Maximum capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased to 300 million through the exercise by us of an uncommitted accordion feature through which existing and new lenders may, at their option, agree to provide additional financing. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority interest in substantially all of the portfolio investments held by the Company and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions, and includes a 25 million limit for swingline loans. 
 The availability period under the Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on June 23, 2027 (the Commitment Termination Date and will mature on June 23, 2028 (the Final Maturity Date ). During the period from the Commitment Termination Date to the Final Maturity Date, we will be obligated to make mandatory prepayments out of the proceeds of certain asset sales and other recovery events and equity and debt issuances. 
 We may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Amounts drawn in U.S. dollars will bear interest at either term SOFR plus a margin, or the prime rate plus a margin. We may elect either the term SOFR or prime rate at the time of drawdown, and loans denominated in U.S. dollars may be converted from one rate to another at any time at our option, subject to certain conditions. Amounts drawn in other permitted currencies will bear interest at the relevant rate specified therein plus an applicable margin. We also will pay a fee of 0.375 on average daily undrawn amounts. As of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at one-month SOFR plus 2.25 per annum. 
 The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement includes customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence by the Company of additional indebtedness and on the Company s ability to make distributions to its shareholders, or redeem, repurchase or retire shares of stock, upon the occurrence of certain events, and certain financial covenants related to asset coverage and minimum shareholders equity, as well as customary events of default.

Related-Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 the Advisory Agreement; 
 the CAM Sub-Advisory Agreement; 
 the NAM Sub-Advisory Agreement; 
 the Administration Agreement; and 
 the Expense Support Agreement. 
 On June 7, 2019, the SEC granted an exemptive order (the Order that permits us to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions with certain other funds and accounts sponsored or managed by either of the Advisers and/or their affiliates, subject to the conditions of the Order. Pursuant to the Order, the Company is permitted to co-invest with its affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board's independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company's stockholders and is consistent with its then-current investment objective and strategies. Neither we nor the affiliated funds are obligated to invest or co-invest when investment opportunities are referred to us or them. 
 In addition, pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC on April 8, 2020 and applicable to all BDCs through December 31, 2020 (the Temporary Relief ), the Company was permitted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to complete follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company. Without the Temporary Relief, such private funds would not be able to participate in such follow-on investments with us unless the private funds had previously acquired securities of the portfolio company in a co-investment transaction with the Company. Although the Temporary Relief expired on December 31, 2020, the SEC s Division of Investment Management had indicated that until March 31, 2022, it would not recommend enforcement action, to the extent that any BDC with an existing co-investment order continues to engage in certain transactions described in the Temporary Relief, pursuant to the same terms and conditions described therein. The conditional exemptive order is no longer effective; however, on October 14, 2022, the SEC granted an exemptive order to permit the Company to continue to complete follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company, subject to certain conditions. 
 Expense Support Agreement 
 On December 31, 2019, we entered into the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. The Expense Support Agreement automatically terminated pursuant to its terms upon the consummation of the IPO on January 29, 2024. Under the Expense Support Agreement, the Adviser was able to pay certain of our expenses (each, an Expense Payment ), provided that no portion of the payment was used to pay any of our interest expense. Such Expense Payment was made in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after a written commitment from the Adviser to pay such expense, and/or by an offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser or its affiliates. The cumulative amount of expense payments by the Adviser under the Expense Support Agreement was 2,979, of which 1,101 was reimbursed by the Company prior to the termination of the Expense Support Agreement. 
 101 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the ordinary course of its business, the Company enters into contracts or agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could occur which may give rise to liabilities arising from these provisions against us. We believe that the likelihood of such an event is remote; however, the maximum potential exposure is unknown. No accrual has been made in these consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We have in the past and may in the future become obligated to fund commitments such as delayed draw commitments, revolvers, and equity investment commitments. 
 For more information on our off-balance sheet arrangements, commitments and contingencies see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report Form 10-Q. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies and estimates, including those relating to the valuation of our portfolio investments, are described below. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Valuation of Portfolio Investments, Revenue Recognition, and U.S. Federal Income Taxes, are described below. The valuation of investments is our most significant critical estimate. The critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 At all times, consistent with U.S. GAAP and the 1940 Act, we conduct a valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value is determined. 
 Our assets are valued on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Adviser as the Company's valuation designee (the Valuation Designee to determine the fair value of the Company's investments that do not have readily available market quotations, which became effective beginning with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Company's valuation policy approved by the Board, a valuation committee comprised of employees of the Adviser (the Valuation Committee is responsible for determining the fair value of the Company's assets for which market quotations are not readily available, subject to the oversight of the Board. 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. Market quotations are obtained from independent pricing services, where available. Generally investments marked in this manner will be marked at the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we or an independent third-party valuation firm engaged by the Valuation Designee, will take into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including and in combination of: comparison to publicly traded securities, including factors such as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality; the enterprise value of a portfolio company; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows; and the markets in which the portfolio company does business. Investment performance data utilized are the most recently available financial statements and compliance certificates received from the portfolio companies as of the measurement date which in many cases may reflect a lag in information. The independent third-party valuation firm provides a fair valuation report, a description of the methodology used to determine the fair value and their analysis and calculations to support their conclusion. 
 When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale or paydown occurs, we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation. 
 U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the level of observability of market price inputs used in measuring investments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment and state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Investments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value. W e review pricing and methodologies in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. 
 102 

Our accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the consolidated financial statements. 
 For more information on the fair value hierarchies, our framework for determining fair value and the composition of our portfolio see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report Form 10-Q. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Our revenue recognition policies are as follows: 
 Net realized gains (losses) on investments: Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method. 
 Investment Income: Interest income, including amortization of premium and accretion of discount on loans are recorded on the accrual basis. We accrue interest income based on the effective yield if we expect that, ultimately, we will be able to collect such income. We may have loans in our portfolio that contain payment-in-kind PIK income provisions. PIK represents interest that is accrued and recorded as interest income at the contractual rates, increases the loan principal on the respective capitalization dates, and is generally due at maturity. 
 Other income may include income such as consent, waiver, amendment, unused, and prepayment fees associated with our investment activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered by us to our portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. 
 Non-accrual: Generally, if a payment default occurs on a loan in the portfolio, or if management otherwise believes that the issuer of the loan will not be able to make contractual interest payments or principal payments, the Sub-Adviser will place the loan on non-accrual status and we will cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal and interest is current through payment or until a restructuring occurs, such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible even though we remain contractually entitled to this interest. We may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. Accrued interest is written off when it becomes probable that the interest will not be collected and the amount of uncollectible interest can be reasonably estimated. 
 U.S. Federal Income Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as we maintain our qualification as a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our stockholders and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
 We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria, nor did the Company have any unrecognized tax benefits. 
 Our accounting policy on income taxes is critical because if we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we would be required to record a provision for U.S. federal income taxes which may be significant to our financial results. 
 103 

Recent Developments 
 On October 4, 2024, we entered into a second amendment (the Second Amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, among the Company, as borrower, the lenders and issuing banks from time to time party thereto, SMBC, as administrative agent and sole bookrunner, and SMBC and Wells Fargo as joint lead arrangers. The Second Amendment, among other things, (x) added a term loan tranche, (y) increased the total committed facility amount from 250 million to 325 million and (z) reduced (i) the applicable margin from 2.125 to 2.00 and (ii) the credit spread adjustment from 0.15 to 0.10 for Term SOFR borrowings with a three-month tenor and from 0.25 to 0.10 for Term SOFR borrowings with a six-month tenor. 
 On October 29, 2024, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors, approved the renewal of each Advisory Agreement in accordance with, and on the basis of, an evaluation satisfactory to such directors as required by the 1940 Act for an additional one-year term expiring on December 1, 2025. 
 On November 4, 2024, the Board declared a fourth quarter regular dividend of 0.45 per share payable on or around January 28, 2025 to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2024. 
 On November 5, 2024, the Company terminated in full the SMBC Financing Facility Agreement, dated as of November 24, 2020, and the SMBC Financing Facility thereunder. In connection with the termination of the SMBC Financing Facility, the Company also terminated the security interest over the collateral granted to SMBC and the lenders pursuant to the SMBC Financing Facility Agreement. The SMBC Financing Facility was terminated concurrent with the satisfaction of all obligations and liabilities of the Company to the lenders thereunder, including, without limitation, payments of principal and interest, other fees, breakage costs and other amounts owing to the lenders. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Uncertainty with respect to, among other things, elevated interest rates, inflationary pressures, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the ongoing war in the Middle East, and the failure of major financial institutions introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility has materially impacted and could continue to materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments do not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, as the Valuation Designee, in accordance with our valuation policy subject to the oversight of the Board and, based on, among other things, the input of the independent third-party valuation firms engaged by the Valuation Designee. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing internals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Our net investment income is also affected by fluctuations in various interest rates, including the replacement of LIBOR with alternate rates and prime rates, to the extent our debt investments include floating interest rates. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 On September 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in four years by 0.50 , bringing it to the 4.75 to 5.00 range. Although, the Federal Reserve has signaled in favor of cutting its benchmark rates again in the fourth quarter of 2024 they still remain focused on mitigating inflationary pressures, and there can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will continue to make downward adjustments to the federal funds rate in the future. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will not make upward adjustments to the federal funds rate in the future. In a high interest rate environment, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. It is possible that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle could result the United States into a recession, which would likely decrease interest rates. A prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in base rates, such as SOFR or other alternate rates, are not offset by corresponding increases in the spread over such base rate that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses, or a decrease in the interest rate associated with our borrowings. 
 104 

As of September 30, 2024, on a fair value basis, approximately 5.75 of our debt investments bear interest at a fixed rate and approximately 94.25 of our debt investments bear interest at a floating rate. As of September 30, 2024, 99.59 of our floating rate debt investments are subject to interest rate floors. Our credit facilities along with our debt issued in our collateralized loan obligations are predominantly subject to floating interest rates and are currently paid based on floating SOFR rates. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income and expenses, should interest rates increase or decrease by 100, 200 or 300 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our portfolio of investments held on September 30, 2024. Interest expense is calculated based on the terms of the credit facilities and the collateralized loan obligations using the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. Interest expense on the credit facilities and the debt issued in our collateralized loan obligations is calculated using the interest rate as of September 30, 2024, adjusted for the impact of hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Based on that evaluation, we, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 We, and our consolidated subsidiaries, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceedings threatened against us or them. From time to time, we, our consolidated subsidiaries and/or the Adviser and Sub-Adviser may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business also is subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the information under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024, which is accessible on the SEC s website at sec.gov. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Sales of Unregistered Securities 
 Except as previously reported by us on our Current Reports on Form 8-K, we did not sell any securities during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On March 5, 2024, the Company entered into a share repurchase plan (the Company 10b5-1 Plan ), pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to 99,275 in the aggregate of its outstanding shares of common stock in the open market at prices below its NAV per share over a specified period. Any purchase of the shares pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines and conditions of Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The Company adopted the Company 10b5-1 Plan because it believes that, if its common stock is trading below its then-current NAV per share, it will be in the best interest of its stockholders for the Company to reinvest in its portfolio. 
 
 The Company 10b5-1 Plan is designed to allow the Company to repurchase its shares of common stock at times when the Company otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company 10b5-1 Plan requires BofA Securities, Inc., as agent, to repurchase shares of common stock on the Company's behalf when the market price per share is below the most recently reported NAV per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by the Company to any previously announced NAV per share). Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made as the price of the shares of the Company's common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any share repurchases will depend on the terms and conditions of the Company 10b5-1 Plan, the market price of the shares of the Company's common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of shares of the common stock will be repurchased. 
 
 The purchase of shares of common stock pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan is intended to satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and will otherwise be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M, which may prohibit purchases under certain circumstances. 
 
 The Company 10b5-1 Plan became effective on March 29, 2024 and commenced on April 1, 2024. The 10b5-1 Plan will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) 12-months from the effective date (tolled for periods during which the Company 10b5-1 Plan is suspended), (ii) the end of the trading day on which the aggregate purchase price for all shares of common stock purchased under the Company 10b5-1 Plan equals 99,275 and (iii) the occurrence of certain other events described in the Company 10b5-1 Plan. 
 
 107 

The following table reflects the shares repurchased pursuant to the Company 10b5-1 Plan for each month from inception through September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data):
