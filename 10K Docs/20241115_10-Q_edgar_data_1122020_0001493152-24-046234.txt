as of September 30, 2024, related to contractual commitments with customers where the performance
obligation will be satisfied within the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025. The revenue associated with these performance obligations is
recognized as the obligation is satisfied. The Company had of deferred revenue as of March 31, 2024. 

Most
of our contracts with customers contain transaction prices with fixed consideration; however, some contracts may contain variable consideration
in the form of discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties, and other similar
items. When a contract includes variable consideration, we evaluate the estimate of variable consideration to determine whether the estimate
needs to be constrained; therefore, we include the variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable
that a significant reversal of the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable
consideration is subsequently resolved. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a
product or service to a customer. This can result in recognition of revenue over time as we perform services or at a point in time when
the deliverable is transferred to the customer, depending on an evaluation of the criteria for over time recognition in FASB ASC 606.
For certain fixed-fee per transaction contracts, such as delivering training courses or conducting workshops, revenue is recognized during
the period in which services are delivered in accordance with the pricing outlined in the contracts.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Cautionary
Statements for Purposes of Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: 

Except
for historical facts, all matters discussed in this Annual Report, which are forward-looking, involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty.
Certain statements in this Annual Report set forth management s intentions, plans, beliefs, expectations, or predictions of the
future based on current facts and analyses. When we use the words believe, expect, anticipate, 
 estimate, intend, or similar expressions, we intend to identify forward-looking statements. You should not
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such statements,
due to a variety of factors, risks, and uncertainties. Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, competitive
pressures from other companies within the Educational Industries, economic conditions in the Company s primary markets, exchange
rate fluctuation, reduced product demand, increased competition, inability to produce required capacity, unavailability of financing,
government action, weather conditions and other uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. We assume no duty to update
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1, Condensed Financial Statements , in Part I of this Quarterly Report. 

Overview
of Current and Planned Operations 

PCS
Edventures!, Inc. sells STEM / STEAM products to educational and recreational entities serving youth. Currently, we do not attempt to
align our products to fit in the classroom setting although we are aware that some of our customers use our products to fill enrichment
time blocks in the classroom during formal school time. Classroom curriculum must align with specific state standards to be considered
for use. Each state has their own unique set of standards, making classroom curriculum development a state by-state endeavor. 

12 

On
the other hand, out of school programs are not subject to state governmental standards alignment, although these programs often require
that educational programs align with various sets of state or national educational standards. This difference makes it easier to penetrate
out-of-school programs, as more freedom exists for curriculum development. We focus our efforts on these out-of-school programs, which
include summer school, summer camps, YMCA programs, Boys and Girls club programs, and various other programs offered outside of the classroom,
at all times of the year, that are too numerous to list. Oftentimes, these programs are sponsored, administered, and/or supported by
local school districts, and we employ considerable efforts to build relationships with these types of school districts to provide desired
programing for their out-of-school programs. The majority of the time, the out-of-school programs offered are funded with grants; however,
some programs are run on a for-profit basis. The Company sells to all of these types of entities. 

We
offer professional development training for instructors using our products; and typically charge a fee for this service, with the fee
primarily covering our expenses. Management does not view this service as a profit center, but rather as a customer service component
of our products that adds to its uniqueness and value in the marketplace, and as a market development endeavor to build out the Company s
addressable market. 

The
nature of our target market produces considerable seasonality for the Company s revenue. The quarter ended June 30 tends to be
the peak of this seasonality, while the quarter ended December 31 tends to be the low point of our seasonality. The Table below reflects
this seasonality.

The
Company, through winning a competitive Request For Proposal, added the Air Force Junior Reserve Officers Training
Corp AFJROTC as a customer in the second half of calendar year 2022. The Company experienced elevated sales due to the
fulfillment of the AFJROTC orders for the quarters ended December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023. One of the AFJROTC
revenue quarters was December 31, 2022, which corresponds with the lowest seasonal revenue quarter, so the effects of seasonality in
2022 were not as readily apparent as in other calendar years. The table below removes the AFJROTC revenue to highlight the seasonality
that the Company experiences.

Sales and marketing activities remain fairly constant throughout the year.

Revenue 

For
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our revenue was 2,267,338, which was 1,499,988 less than our revenue for the quarter ended September
30, 2023 of 3,767,326. The decrease in revenue was largely due to the difference between two (2) large customer orders that we fulfilled
in the September 30, 2023, quarter, amounting to 1,246,236 (Air Force JROTC) and 801,301 (Iowa Scale-UP). During the September 30,
2024, quarter, these two (2) customers accounted for 445,113 and 0 of revenue, respectively. The difference in revenue received by
these two (2) customers was 1,602,424 between the two (2) quarters, whereas the difference in total revenue for the two (2) quarters
was 1,499,988. 

13 

For
the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue was 5,427,262, which was 946,345 less than our revenue for the six (6) months
ended September 30, 2023, of 6,372,607. As with the case above, the decrease in revenue was largely due to the difference in the Company s
revenue from the Air Force JROTC and Iowa Scale-Up, amounting to 1,246,236 and 801,301, respectively during the six (6) month period
ending September 30, 2023. During the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024, these two (2) customers accounted for 445,113 and 0
of revenue, respectively. The difference in revenue received by these two (2) customers was 1,602,424 between the two (2) periods, whereas
the difference in total revenue for the two (2) periods was 946,345. 

Excluding
the revenue from the Air Force JROTC and Iowa Scale-Up would produce the following revenue:

We
believe that we can continue to experience success in soliciting larger customers, but we can offer no assurances that success will be
certain, nor can we offer any numerical framework in describing the success that may occur. Risk factors include anything that would
negatively affect educational funding in the United States; finding and retaining employees that meet our high standards; and anything
that would negatively affect our supply chain of critical components. 

Cost
of Sales 

We
strive to have a cost of sales that is less than 40 of revenue. We price our products once per year, at the beginning of the calendar
year, and maintain that pricing level throughout the year. During inflationary environments, when the price level of the Company s
raw materials is increasing, the Company must absorb that negative impact to gross margins until it can reprice its products at the beginning
of the next calendar year. This repricing analysis considers the current pricing level of materials, as well as the likely increase in
those levels in the year ahead. We attempt to incorporate shipping costs into the cost of raw materials, but oftentimes during the course
of the year, we are compelled to ship in a more expedient manner, which is more expensive than our baseline assumptions. 

14 

For
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our cost of sales was 912,651, or 40.3 of revenue. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023,
our cost of sales was 1,188,826, or 31.6 of revenue. For any given quarter, and especially in low revenue quarters, the cost of sales
can vary significantly from our desired 40 or less of revenue. However, for any given year, the calculation is relevant and desired
to be 40 or less of revenue. The difference in the cost of sale for the two (2) quarters was due to the product mix of sales. Some of
our products carry higher margins than others, and we had a more favorable mix in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, versus that for
the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

For
the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024, our cost of sales was 2,111,087, or 38.9 of revenue. For the six (6) months ended September
30, 2023, our cost of sales was 2,192,896, or 34.4 of revenue.

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses are divided into two (2) categories salary + wages, and general + administrative. Salary and wages tend to increase
over time as the Company has been increasing its number of employees, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Also, the Company
desires to retain employees over the long term, which requires periodic increases in compensation as their value to the Company increases. 

The
Company also has a discretionary quarterly bonus program based on qualified revenue. Qualified revenue is defined as revenue where there
are no reseller fees or other price adjustments associated with that revenue. Thus, all reseller sales are disqualified from the discretionary
quarterly bonus calculation, as are other miscellaneous transactions where the Company did not receive a full margin. During quarters
with higher revenue, salaries and wages will increase, all other things equal. 

Salary
and wages were 485,734 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, salaries and wages were 513,676.
Salaries and wages decreased during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, due to
the lower revenue in the September 30, 2024, quarter, producing lower bonus amounts than those for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.
This effect offset a higher employee count for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, versus that for the quarter ended September 30,
2023. 

For
the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024, salary and wages were 1,004,031 versus 959,952 for the six (6) months ended September
30, 2023. Salaries and wages increased slightly during the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the six (6) months ended
September 30, 2023, as increases in salaries and employee additions outweighed a lower bonus amount. 

General
and administrative expenses include all operating expenses outside of salaries and wages. These include the following categories: 

1. 
 Advertising
 and marketing expenses 

2. 
 Trade
 show and travel expenses 

3. 
 Product
 development expenses 

4. 
 Finance
 charges 

5. 
 Contract
 labor expenses 

6. 
 Lease
 expenses 

7. 
 Insurance
 premiums 

8. 
 Workers 
 compensation expenses 

9. 
 Office
 supplies and repairs 

10. 
 Professional
 expenses 

11. 
 Licenses 

12. 
 State
 sales tax expenses 

13. 
 Office
 and warehouse infrastructure expenses 

15 

Most
of these expenses are not correlated with changes in revenue, but they tend to increase over time. General and administrative expenses
were 356,154 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, general and administrative expenses
were 294,807. This increase in general and administrative expenses this quarter versus last year s quarter was due to significant
increases in annual state income tax estimates that the Company uses to make quarterly estimated state tax payments. For the quarter
ended September 30, 2023, state income taxes paid was 38,192. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, state income taxes paid was
 85,141. Annual state tax estimates for the next year are based on the current year s earnings experience. Last year, the Company s
estimated tax payments understated the actual taxes owed. Because revenue was down this year versus last year, it is likely that the
Company is paying more taxes, based on the estimates, than the taxes that the Company will ultimately owe for calendar year 2024. 

For
the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 715,924 compared to 589,641 for the six (6) months
ended September 30, 2023. As above, state income tax estimates increasing significantly is the largest contributor to the increase in
general and administrative expenses for the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024. 

Additional
expenses associated with being an SEC reporting company under the Exchange Act also contributed to the rise in general
and administrative expenses for both the three (3) and six (6) months ending September 30, 2024, versus the year-ago periods. 

Other
Income 

Interest
income was the sole source of other income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and was 37,613. For the quarter ended September
30, 2023, interest income was 10,315, while income associated with the Employee Retention Tax Credit ERTC was 31,258,
producing total other income of 41,573 for the period. 

For
the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024, interest income was the sole source of other income and was 59,123. For the six (6) months
ended September 30, 2023, other income was 41,850 and consisted of interest income of 11,240 and income associated with the ERTC of
 30,610. 

For
comparisons for both periods, interest income rose substantially as our cash invested in our money market savings account increased significantly.
The Company s surplus cash is invested in a Vanguard money market fund that invests exclusively in repurchase agreements
and short-term U.S. government securities. The ticker symbol of this fund is VMFXX. 

Net
Income Before Tax 

For
the three (3) months ended September 30, 2024, net income before tax was 550,412 versus 1,811,590 for the three (3) months ended September
30, 2023. Lower revenue and lower gross margin during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, versus those for the quarter ended September
30, 2023, were responsible for the variance in net income before taxes. 

For
the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024, net income before tax was 1,655,343 versus 2,671,968 for the six (6) months ended September
30, 2023. Lower revenue and lower gross margin during the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024, versus those for the six (6) months
ended September 30, 2023, were responsible for the variance in net income before taxes. 

16 

Taxes 

The
Company has a significant tax-loss carry-forward asset, which arose due to past losses. At March 31, 2024, the Company had net operating
losses of approximately 9.2 million that may be offset against future taxable income. 

Prior
to fiscal year 2023, the Company offset its potential tax benefit from the operating loss carry-forwards with a valuation allowance in
the same amount. As it became clear that the Company will more likely than not use its tax loss carry-forward amounts, the valuation
allowance was partially removed for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, such that the tax benefit recognized by us in fiscal year 2023
was 1,011,466. The valuation allowance was fully removed as of March 31, 2024, resulting in a tax benefit of 1,529,793 for fiscal year
2024. 

While
we do not expect to pay federal income taxes for fiscal year 2025, the deferred tax asset will be adjusted on a quarterly basis to reflect
the amount of taxes it is offsetting for the quarter. The provision for income tax is an unwinding of the tax benefit we recorded in
prior periods when we recognized the value of the deferred tax asset on income statement. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Cash
Flow from Operations 

For
the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operations was 2,852,232 compared to cash provided by operations of 1,749,146
for the six (6) months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by operations increased significantly, despite a difference in net income
of 1,383,464), largely due to the difference in the change in accounts receivable. For the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024,
accounts receivable decreased by 940,170, compared to an increasing accounts receivable balance of 1,219,554 for the six (6) months
ended September 30, 2023, which had the effect of reducing cash provided by operations by the same amount for the period. 

As
of September 30, 2024, total current assets were 6,992,836 and total current liabilities were 486,760, resulting in working capital
of 6,506,076. As of March 31, 2024, total current assets were 5,425,141 and total current liabilities were 416,154, resulting in working
capital of 5,008,987. The Company had a current ratio as of September 30, 2024, of 14.4 compared to a current ratio of 13.0 as of March
31, 2024. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 4,005,145 in cash and cash equivalents compared to 1,329,708 in cash as of March 31, 2024. The improvements
in working capital and cash on hand are due to a reduction in accounts receivable and a positive net income during the period. 

Cash
Flow from Investing Activities 

For
the six (6) months ended September 30, 2024, cash used by investing activities was 32,982 compared to cash used by investing activities
of 8,656 for the six (6) months ended September 30, 2023. We purchased a forklift for the warehouse for 26,829 during the six (6) months
ended September 30, 2024, which accounts for the majority of the difference between the two (2) periods. 

Cash
Flow from Financing Activities 

For
the three (6) months ended September 30, 2024, cash used by financing activities was 143,813 compared to cash used by financing activities
of 64,933 for the six (6) months ended September 30, 2023. In both periods, cash used by financing activities was solely due to the
purchase of the Company s common stock, by the Company, in private transactions with shareholders who solicited the Company for
an offer. In all cases, the common stock purchased by the Company was retired. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
had no Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements during the three (3) month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, nor did we have any such
Arrangements during the six (6) month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

The
Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and is not required to provide the information required
under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure
that material information relating to us is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior
management and the Board of Directors. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our President, who acts as our Principal Financial Officer, have evaluated
the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2024, of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30,
2024, because of inadequate control and expertise over preparation of the preliminary financial statements and schedules for our auditor s
review, resulting in some minor errors in applying Accounting Standards Codifications used in the United States to organize
and present accounting standards and principles. Management has concluded that we will take appropriate action to add additional expertise
to assist us in the preparation of our future interim financial statements for our auditor s review to ameliorate this weakness.
Management acknowledges that as a smaller reporting entity, it is difficult to have adequate accounting staff to perform appropriate
additional reviews of the financial statements. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
has contracted with additional expertise to assist us in the preparation of our future interim financial statements to ameliorate any
internal control weakness and to assist us in designing and implementing a system of adequate controls over the preparation of our financial
statements and schedules. There have been no other actions or changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. However, improving our internal controls over financial reporting is an ongoing process.
