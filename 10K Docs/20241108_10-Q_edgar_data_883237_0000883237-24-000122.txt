We use a multi-manager, multi-style approach, offering investment strategies from our investment managers, each having its own distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and individual brand, as well as from select unaffiliated managers for certain of our funds. By offering a broad array of products, we believe we can appeal to a greater number of investors and have offerings across market cycles and through changes in investor preferences. Our earnings are primarily from asset-based fees charged for services relating to these various products, including investment management, fund administration, distribution, and shareholder services.

Table of Contents 

Average fees earned represent investment management fees, net of revenue-related adjustments, and excluding the impact of consolidated investment products ("CIP") divided by average net assets. Revenue-related adjustments are based on specific agreements and reflect the portion of investment management fees passed-through to third-party client intermediaries for services to investors in sponsored investment products. Fund fees are calculated based on average daily or weekly net assets. Retail separate account fees are calculated based on the end of the preceding or current quarter s asset values or on an average of month-end balances. Institutional account fees are calculated based on an average of month-end balances, an average of current quarter s asset values or on a combination of the underlying cash flows and the principal value of the product. Average fees earned will vary based on several factors, including the asset mix and expense reimbursements to the funds. 
 
 The average fee rate earned on all products was flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year.

 Investment Management Fees 
 Investment management fees are earned based on a percentage of assets under management and are paid pursuant to the terms of the respective investment management agreements, which generally require monthly or quarterly payments. Investment management fees increased by 9.0 million, or 4.9 , and 44.5 million, or 8.4 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the increase in average assets under management. 
 
 Distribution and Service Fees

Distribution and service fees decreased by 0.8 million, or 5.3 , and 1.6 million, or 3.8 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to lower sales and average assets under management for open-end funds in share classes that have sales- and asset-based distribution and service fees. 
 
 Administration and Shareholder Service Fees 
 Administration and shareholder service fees represent fees earned for fund administration and shareholder services from our U.S. retail funds, ETFs and certain closed-end funds. Fund administration and shareholder service fees decreased by 0.5 million, or 2.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and remained consistent during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease during the three-month period is due to the decrease in average assets under management of our U.S. retail funds. 
 
 Other Income and Fees 
 Other income and fees primarily represent fees related to other fee-earning assets and marketing fees earned on certain ETFs. Other income and fees remained consistent during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year.

 Employment Expenses 
 Employment expenses consist of fixed and variable compensation and related employee benefit costs. Employment expenses of 105.6 million increased by 4.0 million, or 3.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in sales- and profit-based compensation. Employment expenses increased by 21.5 million, or 7.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in profit- and sales-based compensation and the addition of AlphaSimplex. 
 
 Distribution and Other Asset-Based Expenses 
 Distribution and other asset-based expenses consist primarily of payments to third-party client intermediaries for providing services to investors in sponsored investment products. These payments are primarily based on assets under management. Distribution and other asset-based expenses remained consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased by 1.1 million, or 1.5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease during the nine-month period was primarily due to decreases in assets under management in share classes that have asset-based distribution and other asset-based expenses. 
 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Other operating expenses primarily consist of investment research and data costs, software application and development expenses, professional fees, travel and distribution-related costs, rent and occupancy expenses, and other business costs. Other operating expenses remained consistent during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year.

The increase during the nine-month period was primarily due to the refinancing of two CLOs in the current year to date period. 
 
 Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration 
 Contingent consideration related to the Company's acquisitions are fair valued on each reporting date incorporating changes in various estimates, including underlying performance estimates, discount rates and the amount of time until the conditions of the contingent payments are achieved. The change in fair value is recorded in the current period as a gain or loss. The 4.0 million and 0.5 million changes in fair value of contingent consideration for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year were primarily attributable to changes in underlying performance estimates.

Amortization expense decreased 2.5 million, or 16.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the current year period. Amortization expense decreased by 2.2 million, or 4.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the current year period partially offset by the addition of AlphaSimplex intangible assets in the second quarter of the prior year.

 Interest and dividend income remained consistent during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
 
 Interest and Dividend Income of Investments of CIP 
 Interest and dividend income of investments of CIP increased 0.8 million, or 1.7 , and 9.6 million, or 6.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were primarily due to the addition of a CLO in the third quarter of 2023 and higher average interest rates during the current year periods. 
 
 Interest Expense of CIP 
 Interest expense of CIP represents interest expense on the notes payable of CIP. Interest expense of CIP remained consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year and increased by 7.9 million, or 7.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase for the current year to date period is primarily attributable to the addition of a CLO in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 The provision for income taxes reflected U.S. federal, state and local taxes at an estimated effective tax rate of 24.4 and 23.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The higher estimated effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a change in excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation.

 Uses of Capital 
 Our operating expenses consist of employee compensation and related benefit costs and other operating expenses, which primarily consist of investment research and data costs, software application and development expenses, professional fees, distribution and occupancy costs, as well as interest on our indebtedness and income taxes. Annual incentive compensation, our largest annual operating cash expenditure, is paid in the first quarter of the year. In 2024 and 2023, we paid 146.1 million and 142.1 million, respectively, in incentive compensation earned during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 In addition to operating activities, other uses of cash could include: (i) investments in organic growth, including seeding or launching new products and expanding distribution; (ii) debt principal payments through scheduled amortization or additional paydowns; (iii) dividend payments to common stockholders; (iv) repurchases of our common stock, or withholding obligations for the net settlement of employee share transactions; (v) investments in our technology infrastructure; (vi) investments in inorganic growth opportunities that may require upfront and/or future payments; (vii) integration costs, including restructuring and severance, related to acquisitions, if any; and (viii) purchases of affiliate equity interests. 
 
 Capital and Reserve Requirements 
 Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC, Central Bank of Ireland or other regulators that subject them to certain rules regarding minimum net capital. Failure to meet these requirements could result in adverse consequences to us, including additional reporting requirements, or interruption of our business. At September 30, 2024, these subsidiaries were in compliance with all minimum net capital requirements. 
 
 Balance Sheet 
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and money market fund investments. Investments consist primarily of investments in our sponsored funds. CIP represent investment products for which we provide investment management services and where we have either a controlling financial interest or are considered the primary beneficiary of an investment product that is considered a variable interest entity.

 Net cash provided by operating activities of 104.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 125.3 million from net cash provided by operating activities of 229.8 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease of 139.4 million in net sales of investments by CIP in the current year period.
