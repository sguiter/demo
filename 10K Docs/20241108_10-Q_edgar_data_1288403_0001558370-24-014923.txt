The Company also assumed the related asset retirement obligations AROs associated with these assets. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition, which requires that the total purchase price, including transaction costs, be allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. The fair value measurements of the oil and natural gas properties acquired and ARO assumed were derived utilizing an income approach and based, in part, on significant inputs not observable in the market. These inputs represent Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy and include, but are not limited to, estimates of reserves, future operating and development costs, future commodity prices, estimated future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. These inputs required significant judgments and estimates by the Company s management at the time of the valuation.

 million of the reductions taken. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has accrued million related to this matter, consisting of million for the disallowed reductions and million for estimated penalties. The Company disagrees with the position taken by the ONRR and filed an appeal with the ONRR. The Company has continued to pursue its legal rights and, at present, the case is in front of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana where both parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment and opposition briefs. The Company has filed a Reply in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, and the government has in turn filed its Reply brief. With briefing now completed, the Company is waiting for the district court s ruling on the merits. ONRR Audit of Historical Refund Claims In 2023, the Company received notification from the ONRR regarding results of an audit performed on the Company s historical refund claims taken on various properties for alleged royalties owed to the ONRR. The review process is ongoing, and the Company does not believe any accrual is necessary at this time. Bonding Disputes On August 14, 2024, the Company filed a complaint seeking declaratory relief (the Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas against Endurance Assurance Corporation and Lexon Insurance Company (the Sompo Sureties ), providers of government-required surety bonds that secure decommissioning obligations the Company may have with respect to certain oil and gas assets of the Company. As described in the Complaint, the Company has paid all premiums associated with the bonds issued by the Sompo Sureties prior to the Complaint and has not suffered a material change to its financial status. Notwithstanding, the Sompo Sureties have issued written demands to the Company requesting the Company provide certain collateral to the Sompo Sureties, which are inconsistent with the requests of other surety entities who are not party to the Complaint. On October 9, 2024, the Sompo Sureties filed an answer and counterclaim alleging breach of contract due to the Company s failure to provide the collateral demanded by the Sompo Sureties. The Sompo Sureties have issued approximately million in surety bonds on behalf of the Company and have requested million in cash collateral. On October 21, 2024, a separate surety entity, U.S. Specialty Insurance Company USSIC filed a petition in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, alleging, among other things, breach of the indemnity agreement between the Company and USSIC and seeking to compel the Company to provide the collateral demanded by USSIC. On October 25, 2024, the Company filed a notice of removal with the District Court of Harris County, Texas, seeking to remove the case to U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas as a result of the existing Complaint. USSIC has issued approximately million in surety bonds on behalf of the Company and has requested million in cash collateral. In each of the above cases, the Company believes that compliance with the collateral demands of the applicable surety entity would be contrary to the demands of other entities that provide government-required surety bonds to the Company. In addition, the Company believes compliance with these collateral demands could prompt escalating collateral requirements. As a result of the foregoing litigation, the Company may be required to provide the collateral demanded by the surety entities, or the Company may be required to or choose to replace the surety bonds provided by the applicable surety with surety bonds from different surety entities. The Company is seeking to negotiate a reasonable resolution with respect to collateral provision amongst the surety entities and other surety entities with conflicting or different collateral requests.

 million in costs related to these decommissioning obligations and reassessed the existing decommissioning obligations, recording an additional million. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining loss contingency recorded related to the anticipated decommissioning obligations was million. Although it is reasonably possible that the Company could receive state or federal decommissioning orders in the future or be notified of defaulting third parties in existing leases, the Company cannot predict with certainty, if, how or when such orders or notices will be resolved or estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from such orders. However, the Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise the Company s opinion regarding the outcome of certain notices or matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and the Company s cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. To the extent the Company does incur costs associated with these properties in future periods, the Company intends to seek contribution from other parties that owned an interest in the facilities. Other Claims In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a party to various pending or threatened claims and complaints seeking damages or other remedies concerning commercial operations and other matters. In addition, claims or contingencies may arise related to matters occurring prior to the Company s acquisition of properties or related to matters occurring subsequent to the Company s sale of properties. In certain cases, the Company has indemnified the sellers of properties acquired, and in other cases, has indemnified the buyers of properties sold. The Company is also subject to federal and state administrative proceedings conducted in the ordinary course of business including matters related to alleged royalty underpayments on certain federal-owned properties. Although the Company can give no assurance about the outcome of pending legal and federal or state administrative proceedings and the effect such an outcome may have, the Company believes that any ultimate liability resulting from the outcome of such proceedings, to the extent not otherwise provided for or covered by insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. million. The Company contributed of its working interest in certain undeveloped drilling projects to Monza and retained of its working interest. The Joint Venture Drilling Program is structured so that the Company initially received an aggregate of of the revenues less expenses, through the direct ownership from the retained working interest in the Monza projects and the Company s indirect interest through its interest in Monza, for contributing of the estimated total well costs plus associated leases and providing access to available infrastructure at agreed-upon rates.

The grant date fair value of the RSUs was million. This amount will be expensed over the service period. The PSUs are subject to performance criteria of total shareholder return and relative shareholder return (collectively, the TSR PSUs and cash return on capital employed (the CROCE PSUs ). The performance period for the measurement of the performance goal began on January 1, 2024 and ends on December 31, 2026. To be eligible to receive the earned PSUs, employees must be employed from the grant date through December 31, 2026. Different levels of achievement across these metrics will affect the percentage of PSUs that the employee receives upon the satisfaction of the service requirement. The percentage of PSUs received upon vesting ranges from to . The TSR PSUs will account for of the target PSUs granted to employees. The TSR PSUs contain both a service condition and a market condition. The grant date fair value of the TSR PSUs was million and was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. This amount will be expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period. The CROCE PSUs will account for of the target PSUS granted to employees. The CROCE PSUs contain both a service condition and a performance condition. The grant date fair value of the CROCE PSUs was million. The cumulative compensation cost that will be recognized will be equal to the grant date fair value of the awards deemed probable of vesting multiplied by the percentage of the requisite service period that has been rendered. Unlike the TSR PSUs, if the performance condition is not satisfied, any previously recognized compensation expense is not reversed. and , respectively. These effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of nondeductible compensation and adjustments to the Company s valuation allowance. The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was not meaningful primarily as a result of changes in the valuation allowance against the Company s deferred tax assets. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was .

Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this Quarterly Report to us, we and our are to W T Offshore, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The information in this Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report, regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to several risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. If the risks or uncertainties materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect, our results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and assumptions. When used in this Quarterly Report, the words could, believe, anticipate, intend, estimate, expect, project, forecast, may, objective, plan, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We assume no obligation, nor do we intend, to update these forward-looking statements, unless required by law. The information included in this Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects. Such statements specifically include our expectations as to our future financial position, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations and business strategy, potential acquisition opportunities, other plans and objectives for operations, capital for sustained production levels, expected production and operating costs, reserves, hedging activities, capital expenditures, return of capital, improvement of recovery factors and other guidance. Actual results may differ from anticipated results, sometimes materially, and reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. For any such forward-looking statement that includes a statement of the assumptions or bases underlying such forward-looking statement, we caution that, while we believe such assumptions or bases to be reasonable and make them in good faith, assumed facts or bases almost always vary from actual results, sometimes materially. Known material risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations are discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and market risks are discussed in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk , of our 2023 Annual Report, and may be discussed or updated from time to time in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data, and the price and cost assumptions made by reservoir engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing, and production activities, or changes in commodity prices, may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Quarterly Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue.

 BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are an independent oil and natural gas producer, active in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico. As of September 30, 2024, we hold working interests in 53 producing offshore fields in federal and state waters (which include 46 fields in federal waters and seven in state waters). We currently have under lease approximately 673,100 gross acres (515,400 net acres) spanning across the outer continental shelf off the coasts of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama, with approximately 5,600 gross acres in Alabama state waters, 514,000 gross acres on the conventional shelf and approximately 153,500 gross acres in the deepwater. A majority of our daily production is derived from wells we operate. Recent Developments Since our operations are in the Gulf of Mexico, we are particularly vulnerable to the effects of hurricanes on production and operations. Significant hurricane impacts include reductions and/or deferrals of future oil and natural gas production and revenues, increased lease operating expenses for evacuations and repairs and possible acceleration of plugging and abandonment costs. In its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook published in October 2024, the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA estimated that Hurricane Francine, which made landfall on the Louisiana coast on September 11, 2024, resulted in the shut-in of up to 42 of oil production and 53 of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico GOM ). Production capacity in the GOM was unable to return to full capacity because Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm, went through a nearby area two weeks later, extensively disrupting energy systems. Our production was impacted due to precautionary shut-ins of facilities and evacuations associated with both Hurricane Francine and Hurricane Helene. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we estimate deferred production related to Hurricane Francine was approximately 132.8 MBoe and affected 35 fields, and deferred production related to Hurricane Helene was approximately 16.0 MBoe and affected five fields. Production downtime following these hurricanes was extended as a result of damage and power loss at third party downstream facilities, including oil terminals, natural gas processing plants and refineries, causing them to remain offline for several weeks. While our assets and infrastructure did not suffer significant damage during the storm, unplanned costs for minor repairs and restoring production, as well as evacuating employees and contractors, were incurred as a result of the hurricane and are reflected in lease operating expense. On November 7, 2024, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 0.01 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect to pay the dividend on November 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 21, 2024. Business Outlook Our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations are significantly affected by the volume of our oil, NGLs and natural gas production and the prices that we receive for such production. Changes in the prices that we receive for our production impact all aspects of our business; most notably our cash flows from operations, revenues, capital allocation and budgeting decisions and our reserves volumes. Prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas have historically been volatile and can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by weather conditions, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, domestic production activities and political issues, and international geopolitical and economic events. Spot prices for West Texas Intermediate WTI oil averaged 70.24 per barrel in September 2024, down 8 from August 2024. Prices fell in September 2024 as concerns about global oil demand growth outweighed declines in oil inventories and OPEC+ members decisions to delay production increases until December 2024. However, after recent military actions involving Israel, Lebanon and Iran, the spot price for WTI rose to 77.76 per barrel on October 7, 2024, up 13 from a week earlier. In its latest STEO, the EIA is forecasting that WTI spot prices are expected to average 73.13 per barrel in 2025, reflecting a reduction for global oil demand in 2025. However, the conflict between Israel,

 Lebanon and Iran has escalated in recent weeks with no timeline for potential resolution, increasing the possibility for supply disruptions and price volatility. Spot prices for Henry Hub natural gas averaged 2.28 per MMBtu in September, 15 higher than the August 2024 average of 1.98 per MMBtu, as natural gas production fell slightly from August 2024. The decline in production was partly due to an 11 drop in natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico primarily as a result of Hurricanes Francine and Helene. The EIA is forecasting that Henry Hub spot prices are expected to average 2.81 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 3.06 in 2025. The EIA is expecting natural gas prices to rise in 2025 as liquid natural gas exports increase while domestic consumption and production is expected to remain relatively flat. Our average realized sales price for oil and natural gas differs from the WTI average price and the NYMEX Henry Hub average price, respectively, primarily due to premiums or discounts, quality adjustments, location adjustments and volume weighting (collectively referred to as differentials). Oil price differentials primarily represent the transportation costs in moving produced oil at the wellhead to a refinery and are based on the availability of pipeline, rail and other transportation. Natural gas price differentials are strongly impacted by local market fundamentals, availability of transportation capacity from producing areas and seasonal impacts. Prices and differentials for NGLs are related to the supply and demand for the products making up these liquids. Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products which are used as feedstock. In addition to the impact of volatile commodity prices on our operations, continuing inflation could also impact our sales margins and profitability. The annual inflation rate for September 2024 was 2.4 , a slight decrease from the 2.5 rate for August 2024. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered the target federal funds range by 50 basis points to 4.75 to 5.00 , easing monetary policy for the first time in four years due to progress in inflation moving sustainably toward 2 . The Summary of Economic Projections published by the Federal Reserve in September 2024 points to another 50 basis points of cuts in 2024 and another 100 basis points of cuts in 2025. However, if inflation were to begin to rise again, it is possible the Federal Reserve would continue to take action they deem necessary to bring inflation down and to ensure price stability, including rate increases, which could have the effects of raising the cost of capital and depressing economic growth, either or both of which could negatively impact our business.

Changes in average sales prices and production volumes caused the following changes to our oil, NGL and natural gas revenues between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

Price Volume Total Oil (8,125) (1,344) (9,469) NGLs 59 (1,838) (1,779) Natural gas (2,870) (6,497) (9,367) (10,936) (9,679) (20,615) Production volumes decreased by 448 MBoe to 2,854 MBoe during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily related to approximately 3.5 MBoe per day of downtime mainly due to hurricanes and third-party downtime. These decreases were partially offset by increased production from wells acquired in January 2024 .

On a component basis, base lease operating expenses increased 7.2 million, workover expenses decreased 0.9 million, facilities maintenance expense increased 3.9 million and hurricane expenses increased 0.4 million. Expenses for direct labor, materials, supplies, repair, third-party costs and insurance comprise the most significant portion of our base lease operating expense. Base lease operating expenses increased primarily due to the fields acquired in January 2024 and September 2023. Workover and facilities maintenance expenses consist of costs associated with major remedial operations on completed wells to restore, maintain or improve the well s production. Hurricane expenses consist of costs for minor repairs and restoring production, as well as evacuating employees and contractors incurred as a result of the hurricanes. These types of expenses are not necessarily comparable from period to period and can change due to the timing and mix of projects undertaken. Gathering, transportation and production taxes Gathering, transportation and production taxes decreased 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the decrease in production volumes. Depreciation, depletion and amortization DD A DD A increased 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The DD A rate increased to 11.99 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.15 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The DD A rate per Boe increased primarily as a result of a higher depreciable base due to our January 2024 acquisition, increases in capital expenditures, future development costs and capitalized ARO and lower proved reserves.

 Asset retirement obligations accretion expense Accretion expense is the expensing of the changes in value of our ARO as a result of the passage of time over the estimated productive life of the related assets as the discounted liabilities are accreted to their expected settlement values. Accretion expense increased 1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the increase in our ARO liability as a result of our January 2024 acquisition and revisions to the estimates used in calculating the liability. General and administrative G A expenses G A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were relatively flat compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other Income and Expense Items The following table presents the components of other income and expense items for the periods presented and corresponding changes (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Interest expense, net 9,992 9,925 67 Derivative gain, net (3,199) (1,491) (1,708) Other expense, net 15,709 1,927 13,782 Income tax (benefit) expense (4,545) 4,777 (9,322) Interest expense, net Interest expense, net, was relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on the lower outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan, partially offset by a decrease in interest income. Derivative gain, net During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 3.2 million derivative gain for our natural gas derivative contracts consisting of 1.8 million of unrealized gain from the increase in the fair value of our open natural gas contracts and 1.4 million of realized gains. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 1.5 million derivative gain for our natural gas derivative contracts consisting of 2.0 million in realized losses and a 3.5 million unrealized gain from the increase in the fair value of our open natural gas contracts. Unrealized gains or losses on open derivative contracts are recorded as a gain or loss on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations at the end of each month. As a result of the derivative contracts we have on our anticipated production volumes through April 2028, we expect these activities to continue to impact net income (loss) based on fluctuations in market prices for natural gas. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 4 Financial Instruments of this Quarterly Report for additional information. Other expense (income), net Other expense, net increased 13.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily related to the accrual of additional expenses for net abandonment obligations pertaining to a number of legacy Gulf of Mexico properties, partially offset by fees paid by producers to tie into our subsea equipment at one of our wells. Income tax (benefit) expense Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.0 . The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate was primarily due to the impact of nondeductible compensation and adjustments to the valuation allowance. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was not meaningful primarily as a result of changes in the Company s valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.

On a component basis, base lease operating expenses increased 29.3 million, workover expenses decreased 9.6 million, facilities maintenance expense increased 4.1 million and hurricane expenses increased 0.4 million. Base lease operating expenses increased primarily due to nine months of expenses at the fields acquired in January 2024 and September 2023, as well as higher repair, maintenance and labor costs at other fields. Workover and facilities maintenance expenses consist of costs associated with major remedial operations on completed wells to restore, maintain or improve the well s production. Hurricane expenses consist of costs for minor repairs and restoring production, as well as evacuating employees and contractors incurred as a result of the hurricanes. These types of expenses are not necessarily comparable from period to period and can change due to the timing and mix of projects undertaken. Gathering, transportation and production taxes Gathering, transportation and production taxes increased 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher processing fees for our Mobile Bay production that had to be re-routed to a different processing plant, partially offset by lower production volumes. DD A DD A increased 23.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The DD A rate increased to 11.36 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.45 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 G A expenses G A expenses increased 4.3 million to 61.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 57.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to non-recurring professional and legal services and higher medical claims. Other Income and Expense Items The following table presents the components of other income and expense items for the periods presented and corresponding changes (in thousands):

Derivative gain, net During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 5.7 million derivative gain for our natural gas derivative contracts consisting of 5.5 million of realized gains and a 0.2 million unrealized gain from the increase in the fair value of our open natural gas contracts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 41.6 million derivative gain for our natural gas derivative contracts consisting of an unrealized gain of 44.1 million from the increase in the fair value of our open derivative contracts offset by 2.5 million of realized losses. Other expense, net Other expense, net increased 20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily related to the accrual of additional expenses for net abandonment obligations pertaining to a number of legacy Gulf of Mexico properties, partially offset by fees paid by producers to tie into our subsea equipment at one of our wells. Income tax (benefit) expense Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 11.3 and 50.6 , respectively. The effective tax rates differed from the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the impact of state income taxes, nondeductible compensation, and adjustments to the Company s valuation allowance. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Overview Our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital and operating expenditures and strategic acquisitions to allow us to replace our oil and natural gas reserves, repay and service outstanding borrowings, operate our properties and satisfy our ARO. We have funded such activities in the past with cash on hand, net cash provided by operating activities, sales of property, securities offerings and bank and other borrowings, and expect to continue to do so in the future. 

 24 

Table of Contents 
 We expect to support our business requirements primarily with cash on hand and cash generated from operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had 126.5 million of unrestricted cash on hand and 50.0 million available under our Credit Agreement, based on a borrowing base of 50.0 million. We also have up to approximately 83.0 million of availability through our at-the-market equity offering program, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time. Based on our current financial condition and current expectations of future market conditions, we believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and access to the equity markets from our at-the-market equity offering program will provide us with additional liquidity to continue our growth and will allow us to meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding 275.0 million principal amount of the 11.75 Notes. We have commenced discussions with potential lenders and institutional investors regarding a potential refinancing of all or a portion of the 11.75 Notes prior to maturity, although there is no assurance as to the terms of any such refinancing or whether or when such refinancing will occur. We also may seek financings with longer tenors and market-based covenants to continue to provide working and potential acquisition capital. The terms of such financings, which may replace or augment our Credit Agreement, the Term Loan and refinance all or a portion of the 11.75 Notes, may vary significantly from those under the Credit Agreement, the Term Loan and the 11.75 Notes. We may also consider using a portion of our cash balances to reduce the amount required to be refinanced. While the nearing maturity of the 11.75 Notes creates risk with respect to our future liquidity, management believes that the actions being taken to fully repay the 11.75 Notes, including from cash on hand, cash to be generated through operations, a refinancing transaction and from the proceeds of a potential equity sale of up to 83.0 million available under the ATM program, would allow us to repay the 11.75 Notes prior to their maturity. However, there is no guarantee we will be successful in achieving these objectives. We continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to uncertainty created by geopolitical events, a pandemic or a significant decline in oil and natural gas prices, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Cash Flow Information The following table summarizes cash flows provided by (used in) by type of activity for the following periods (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Operating activities 63,856 79,662 (15,806) Investing activities (104,034) (79,451) (24,583) Financing activities (6,616) (312,575) 305,959 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 15.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This was primarily due to a 31.3 million decrease in net (loss) income adjusted for certain noncash items offset by a 15.5 million increase in operating cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in net (loss) income adjusted for certain noncash items was primarily related to a 4.6 million increase in revenues and a 12.3 million increase in derivative cash receipts, partially offset by increases in cash operating expenses. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities is primarily related to lower accounts receivable balances due to decreased revenues partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances in the current period. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased 24.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This was primarily due to an increase of 51.8 million in the acquisition of property interests costs, partially offset by a decrease of 6.4 million in investment in oil and natural gas properties and equipment.

Table of Contents 
 Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased by 306.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This was primarily due to the redemption of the 552.5 million principal amount outstanding of the 9.75 Notes in February 2023 partially offset by the net cash proceeds of 275.0 million received from the issuance of the 11.75 Notes in January 2023. Capital Expenditures The level of our investment in oil and natural gas properties changes from time to time depending on numerous factors, including the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas, acquisition opportunities, liquidity and financing options and the results of our exploration and development activities. The following table presents our capital expenditures for exploration, development, acquisitions and other leasehold costs (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Exploration and development Conventional shelf (1) 14,917 10,461 Deepwater 6,027 19,554 Acquisitions of interests 80,635 28,863 Seismic and other 383 944 Investments in oil and gas property/equipment accrual basis 101,962 59,822 (1) Includes exploration and development capital expenditures in Alabama state waters. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we expect to incur an additional 8.0 million to 10.0 million of capital expenditures in the remainder of 2024, which excludes acquisitions. In our view of the outlook for the remainder of 2024, we believe this level of capital expenditure will leave us with sufficient liquidity to operate our business, while providing liquidity to make strategic acquisitions. At current pricing levels, we expect our cash flows to cover our liquidity requirements, and we expect additional financing sources to be available if needed. If our liquidity becomes stressed from significant or prolonged reductions in realized prices, we have flexibility in our capital expenditure budget to reduce investments. We strive to maintain flexibility in our capital expenditure projects and if commodity prices improve, we may increase our investments. Acquisitions We have grown by making strategic acquisitions of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico. We seek opportunities where we can exploit additional drilling projects and reduce costs. In January 2024, we closed on the acquisition of rights, titles and interest in and to certain leases, wells and personal property in the central shelf region of the Gulf of Mexico, among other assets, for 77.3 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The transaction was funded with cash on hand. We also received a final settlement statement for our September 2023 acquisition of certain oil and natural gas producing assets in the central and eastern shelf region of the Gulf of Mexico and recorded an additional 3.3 million of oil and natural gas properties. Any future acquisitions are subject to the completion of satisfactory due diligence, the negotiation and resolution of significant legal issues, the negotiation, documentation and completion of mutually satisfactory definitive agreements among the parties, the consent of our lenders, our ability to finance the acquisition and approval of our board of directors. We cannot guarantee that any such potential transaction would be completed on acceptable terms, if at all.

 Asset Retirement Obligations We have obligations to plug and abandon wells, remove platforms, pipelines, facilities and equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. Through the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have paid 20.3 million related to these obligations, and we expect to incur an additional 15.0 million to 25.0 million of payments during the remainder of 2024. Our ARO estimates as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 555.0 million and 498.8 million, respectively. As our ARO estimates are for work to be performed in the future, and in the case of our non-current ARO, extend from one to many years in the future, actual expenditures could be substantially different than our estimates. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors , of our 2023 Annual Report for additional information. Debt As of September 30, 2024, we have 399.4 million in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt outstanding, with 22.4 million in aggregate principal coming due over the next twelve months. For additional information about our long-term debt, see Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements Note 3 Debt of this Quarterly Report and Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in our 2023 Annual Report. Dividend s In November 2023, our board of directors approved the implementation of a quarterly cash dividend payable to holders of common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have paid three cash dividends, totaling approximately 4.5 million, to holders of our common stock. The amount and frequency of future dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our material cash commitments from known contractual and other obligations consist primarily of obligations for long-term debt and related interest, operating leases, ARO and other obligations as part of normal operations. Except as disclosed herein, contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 did not change materially from the disclosures in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our 2023 Annual Report.

 THE SUBSIDIARY BORROWERS Aquasition LLC and Aquasition II LLC are both indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of us through their parent, Aquasition Energy LLC (collectively, the Aquasition Entities ). We designated the Aquasition Entities as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture governing the 11.75 Notes. Having been so designated, the Aquasition Entities do not guarantee the 11.75 Notes, and the liens on the assets sold to the Aquasition entities have been released under the Credit Agreement. The Aquasition Entities are not bound by the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement or the indenture governing the 11.75 Notes. Under the Term Loan and related instruments, assets of the Aquasition Entities may not be available to mortgage or pledge as security to secure new indebtedness of us and our other subsidiaries. Below is consolidating balance sheet information reflecting the elimination of the accounts of the Aquasition Entities from our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

Nine Months Ended September 30, Production Volumes: 2024 2023 Oil (MBbls) 11 12 NGLs (MBbls) 627 699 Natural gas (MMcf) 15,572 18,565 Total oil equivalent (MBoe) 3,233 3,805 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our major market risk exposure is the fluctuation of prices for oil, NGL and natural gas. These fluctuations have a direct impact on our revenues, earnings and cash flow. For example, assuming a 10 decline in our average realized oil, NGL and natural gas sales prices in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and assuming no other items had changed, our revenue would have decreased by approximately 12.0 million and 7.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We attempt to mitigate commodity price risk and stabilize cash flows associated with our forecasted sales of natural gas production through the use of swaps, purchased calls and purchased puts. Our derivatives will not mitigate all the commodity price risks of our forecasted sales of natural gas production and, as a result, we will be subject to commodity price risks on our remaining forecasted production.

 The following table summarizes the historical results of our natural gas derivatives: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Natural Gas /Mcf) Average realized sales price, before the effects of derivative settlements 2.79 3.14 2.59 2.88 Effects of realized commodity derivatives 0.17 (0.19) 0.21 (0.09) Average realized sales price, including realized commodity derivatives 2.96 2.95 2.80 2.79 Our exposure to interest rate risk has not changed materially from the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our 2023 Annual Report. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC and that any material information relating to us is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), our CEO and CFO performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have each concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that our controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
