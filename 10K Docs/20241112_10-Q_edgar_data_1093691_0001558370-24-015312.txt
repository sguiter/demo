Income Taxes The Company recorded 0.1 million of income tax expense and 4.7 million of income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company has not changed its overall conclusion with respect to the need for a valuation allowance against its domestic net deferred tax assets, which remain fully reserved, and its valuation allowances recorded in foreign jurisdictions. The domestic net deferred tax asset generated from the Company s net operating loss has been offset by a full valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the net operating loss carryforward will not be realized. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of income tax expense.

The total amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the 2022 Amazon Warrant during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.0 million and 1.6 million, respectively. The total amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the 2022 Amazon Warrant during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4.4 million and 4.3 million, respectively. The assumptions used to calculate the valuations of the 2022 Amazon Warrant as of August 24, 2022 and September 30, 2024 are as follows: 

Tranches 1-3 Tranche 4 August 24, 2022 September 30, 2024 Risk-free interest rate 3.15 3.51 Volatility 75.00 95.00 Expected average term (years) 7.00 1.15 Exercise price 22.98 2.03 Stock price 20.36 2.26 Walmart Transaction Agreement On July 20, 2017, the Company and Walmart entered into a Transaction Agreement (the Walmart Transaction Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to Walmart a warrant (the Walmart Warrant to acquire up to 55,286,696 shares of the Company s common stock, subject to certain vesting events (the Walmart Warrant Shares ). The Company and Walmart entered into the Walmart Transaction Agreement in connection with existing commercial agreements between the Company and Walmart with respect to the deployment of the Company s GenKey fuel cell technology across various Walmart distribution centers. The existing commercial agreements contemplate, but do not guarantee, future purchase orders for the Company s fuel cell technology. The vesting of the warrant shares was conditioned upon payments made by Walmart or its affiliates (directly or indirectly through third parties) pursuant to transactions entered into after January 1, 2017 under existing commercial agreements. The exercise price for the first and second tranches of Walmart Warrant Shares was 2.1231 per share. After Walmart has made payments to the Company totaling 200.0 million, the third tranche of 20,368,784 Walmart Warrant Shares will vest in eight installments of 2,546,098 Walmart Warrant Shares each time Walmart or its affiliates, directly or indirectly through third parties, make an aggregate of 50.0 million in payments for goods and services to the Company, up to payments totaling 400.0 million in the aggregate. The exercise price of the third tranche of the Walmart Warrant Shares is 6.28 per share, which was determined pursuant to the terms of the Walmart Warrant as an amount equal to 90 of the 30-day volume weighted average share price of the Company s common stock as of October 30, 2023, the final vesting date of the second tranche of the Walmart Warrant Shares. The Walmart Warrant is exercisable through July 20, 2027. The Walmart Warrant provides for net share settlement that, if elected by the holder, will reduce the number of shares issued upon exercise to reflect net settlement of the exercise price. The Walmart Warrant provides for certain adjustments that may be made to the exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise due

 to customary anti-dilution provisions based on future events. The Walmart Warrant is classified as an equity instrument. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of the contract asset related to the Walmart Warrant was 5.4 million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 40,010,108 and 34,917,912 of the Walmart Warrant Shares had vested, respectively, and the Walmart Warrant was exercised with respect to 13,094,217 shares of the Company s common stock. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no exercises with respect to the Walmart Warrant. The total amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the Walmart Warrant during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.9 million compared to a negative provision for common stock warrants recorded as an addition to revenue of 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The total amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the Walmart Warrant during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 11.6 million and 8.4 million, respectively. Operating and Finance Lease Liabilities As of September 30 , 2024, the Company had operating leases, as lessee, primarily associated with sale/leaseback transactions that are partially secured by restricted cash and security deposits (see also Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies as summarized below. These leases expire over the next one to seven years. Minimum rent payments under operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Leases contain termination clauses with associated penalties, the amount of which cause the likelihood of cancellation to be remote. At the end of the lease term, the leased assets may be returned to the lessor by the Company, the Company may negotiate with the lessor to purchase the assets at fair market value, or the Company may negotiate with the lessor to renew the lease at market rental rates. No residual value guarantees are contained in the leases. No financial covenants are contained within the lease; however, the lease contains customary operational covenants such as the requirement that the Company properly maintain the leased assets and carry appropriate insurance. The leases include credit support in the form of either cash, collateral or letters of credit. See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies , for a description of cash held as security associated with the leases. The Company has finance leases associated with its property and equipment in Slingerlands, New York and at customer fueling locations. Finance Obligation The Company has sold future services to be performed associated with certain sale/leaseback transactions and recorded the balance as a finance obligation. The outstanding balance of this obligation as of September 30, 2024 was 296.0 million, 77.3 million and 218.7 million of which was classified as short-term and long-term, respectively, on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. The outstanding balance of this obligation at December 31, 2023 was 350.8 million, 74.0 million and 276.8 million of which was classified as short-term and long-term, respectively, on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. The amount is amortized using the effective interest method. Interest expense recorded related to finance obligations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 9.0 million and 10.4 million, respectively. Interest expense recorded related to finance obligations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 28.4 million and 29.4 million, respectively. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into additional failed sale/leaseback transactions that were accounted for as financing obligations resulting in 56.9 million of additional finance obligations. No gain or loss was recorded as a result of these transactions. The outstanding balance of finance obligations related to sale/leaseback transactions as of September 30, 2024 was 65.6 million, 6.0 million and 59.6 million of which was classified as short-term and long-term, respectively, on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet with a residual value of 33.6 million. The outstanding balance of this obligation at December 31, 2023 was 17.6 million, 10.0 million and 7.6 million of which was classified as short-term and long-term, respectively, on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet.

 The fair value of the Company s total finance obligations approximated their carrying value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Restricted Cash In connection with certain of the above noted sale/leaseback agreements, cash of 507.8 million and 573.5 million was required to be restricted as security as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which restricted cash will be released over the lease term. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company also had certain letters of credit backed by security deposits totaling 307.9 million and 370.7 million, respectively, of which 276.5 million and 340.0 million are security for the above noted sale/leaseback agreements, respectively, and 31.4 million and 30.7 million are customs related letters of credit, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 80.0 million and 76.8 million held in escrow related to the construction of certain hydrogen production plants, respectively. The Company also had 0.1 million and 1.2 million of consideration held by our paying agent in connection with each of the Joule and CIS acquisitions, respectively, reported as restricted cash as of September 30, 2024, with a corresponding accrued liability on the Company s unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the Company had 9.3 million and 11.7 million in restricted cash as collateral resulting from the Frames acquisition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Guarantee On May 30, 2023, our joint venture, HyVia, entered into a government grant agreement with Bpifrance. As part of the agreement, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plug Power France, was required to issue a guarantee to Bpifrance in the amount of 20 million through the end of January 2027. Plug Power France is liable to the extent of the guarantee for sums due to Bpifrance from HyVia under the agreement based on the difference between the total amount paid by Bpifrance and the final amount certified by HyVia and Bpifrance. As part of the agreement, there are certain milestones that HyVia is required to meet, and the nonperformance of these milestones or termination of this agreement could result in this guarantee being called upon. As of September 30, 2024, no payments related to this guarantee have been made by the Company and Plug Power France did not record a liability for this guarantee as the likelihood of the guarantee being called upon is remote. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services unconditional purchase obligations ). The Company s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, take or pay contracts and service agreements. For certain vendors, the Company s unconditional obligation to purchase a minimum quantity of raw materials at an agreed upon price is fixed and determinable; while certain other raw material costs will vary due to product forecasting and future economic conditions. Future payments under non-cancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 30, 2024, were as follows (in thousands): 

Remainder of 2024 25,989 2025 8,023 2026 8,023 2027 2,638 2028 2029 and thereafter Total 44,673

 Restructuring In February 2024, in a strategic move to enhance our financial performance and ensure long-term value creation in a competitive market, we approved a comprehensive initiative that encompasses a broad range of measures, including operational consolidation, strategic workforce adjustments, and various other cost-saving actions (the Restructuring Plan ). These measures are aimed at increasing efficiency, improving scalability, and maintaining our leadership position in the renewable energy industry. We began executing the Restructuring Plan in February 2024 and expect the Restructuring Plan to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to local law and consultation requirements. The determination of when we accrue for involuntary termination benefits under restructuring plans depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement or under a one-time benefit arrangement. We account for involuntary termination benefits that are provided pursuant to one-time benefit arrangements in accordance with ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations ASC 420 whereas involuntary termination benefits that are part of an ongoing written or substantive plan are accounted for in accordance with ASC 712, Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits ASC 712 ). We accrue a liability for termination benefits under ASC 420 in the period in which the plan is communicated to the employees and the plan is not expected to change significantly. For ongoing benefit arrangements, inclusive of statutory requirements, we accrue a liability for termination benefits under ASC 712 when the existing situation or set of circumstances indicates that an obligation has been incurred, it is probable the benefits will be paid, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The restructuring charges that have been incurred but not yet paid are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets, as they are expected to be paid within the next twelve months. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 0.6 million in restructuring costs recorded as severance expenses of 0.1 million and other restructuring costs of 0.5 million in the restructuring financial statement line item in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 8.2 million in restructuring costs recorded as severance expenses of 6.9 million and other restructuring costs of 1.3 million in the restructuring financial statement line item in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations. Future restructuring costs are not expected to be material in subsequent quarters. The actual timing and amount of costs associated with these restructuring actions may differ from our current expectations and estimates and such differences may be material. Severance expense recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in accordance with ASC 420 was a result of the separation of full-time employees associated with the Restructuring Plan. As of September 30, 2024, 0.1 million of accrued severance-related costs were included in accrued expenses in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets and are expected to be paid during the fourth quarter of 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other costs were represented by 0.5 million of other one-time employee termination benefits. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other costs were represented by (1) 0.2 million of legal and professional services costs, and (2) 1.1 million of other one-time employee termination benefits. As of September 30, 2024, 29 thousand of accrued other costs were included in accrued expenses in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets and are expected to be paid during the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Extended Maintenance Contracts On a quarterly basis, we evaluate any potential losses related to our extended maintenance contracts for sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other that have been sold. The following table shows the roll forward of balances in the accrual for loss contracts, including changes due to the provision for loss accrual, releases to service cost of sales, increase to loss accrual related to customer warrants, and foreign currency translation adjustment (in thousands): 

Nine months ended Year ended September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Beginning balance 137,853 81,066 Provision for loss accrual 37,997 85,375 Releases to service cost of sales (38,823) (29,713) Increase to loss accrual related to customer warrants 268 971 Foreign currency translation adjustment 214 154 Ending balance 137,509 137,853 Critical Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition, valuation of inventories, intangible assets, valuation of long-lived assets, accrual for service loss contracts, operating and finance leases, allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, unbilled revenue, common stock warrants, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about (1) the carrying values of assets and liabilities and (2) the amount of revenue and expenses realized that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no changes in our critical accounting estimates from those reported in our 2023 Form 10-K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance There have been no significant changes in our reported financial position or results of operations and cash flows resulting from the adoption of new accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued and Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Other than the standards mentioned in our 2023 Form 10-K, all issued but not yet effective accounting and reporting standards as of September 30, 2024 are either not applicable to the Company or are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There has been no material change from the information provided in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K under the section titled Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk .

 Item 4 Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer) as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Part II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1 Legal Proceeding s See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies , within Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion regarding material legal proceedings. Except as otherwise noted, there have been no material developments in legal proceedings. For previously reported information about legal proceedings, refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings , of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. Item 1A Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors that could materially affect the Company s business, financial condition or future results discussed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and the Company s Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 in Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors . The risks described in the 2023 Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 are not the only risks that could affect the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results in the future. As a supplement to the risk factors identified in the 2023 Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, below we have set forth updated risk factors. Other than as provided below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors identified in the 2023 Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024. The funding of the loan guarantee from the Department of Energy may be delayed, and we may not be able to satisfy all of the technical, legal, environmental or financial conditions acceptable to the Department of Energy to receive the loan guarantee. As previously announced, the Company received a conditional commitment for an up to 1.66 billion loan guarantee from the Department of Energy s DOE Loan Programs Office to finance the development, construction, and ownership of up to six green hydrogen production facilities. Our ability to benefit from this loan guarantee is subject to 

 61 

Table of Contents 
 certain technical, legal, environmental and financial conditions, including negotiation of definitive financing documents, to be satisfied before funding of the loan guarantee. Whether and when our DOE loan guarantee will be funded is subject to a number of factors outside of our control, including political administration changes, legislative enactments, administrative actions. The funding of such loan guarantee may take longer than we expect, and if we are not able to satisfy all of the technical, legal, environmental or financial conditions acceptable to the DOE to receive the loan guarantee, our business may be adversely affected. We are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that could harm our business. We are currently, and in the future may continue to be, subject to legal proceedings and similar disputes. In connection with any disputes or litigation in which we are involved, we may incur costs and expenses in connection with defending ourselves or in connection with the payment of any settlement or judgment or compliance with any ruling in connection therewith. It is often challenging to predict the outcome of legal proceedings and similar disputes with certainty. Determining reserves for any litigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment calls. There can be no assurance that our expectations will prove correct, and even if these matters are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, including diversion of management resources, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Item 2 - Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds (a) Not applicable. (b) Not applicable. (c) None. Item 3 Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4 Mine Safety Disclosures None. Item 5 Other Information (c) Director and Officer Trading Arrangements During the three months ended September 30, 2024, of the Company s directors or officers (as defined in Rule a (f) of the Securities Exchange Act) adopted, terminated or modified a Rule b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).

 44 

 pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the Holder s total purchase price (including reasonable and documented brokerage commissions and other reasonable and documented out of pocket expenses, if any) for the Common Shares so purchased (the Buy-In Price ), at which point the Company s obligation to deliver such certificate (and to issue such Common Shares) shall terminate, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to deliver such Common Shares in accordance with Section (4)(b)(i)(1) and pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of (A) such number of Common Shares multiplied by (B) the Closing Price on the Conversion Date, and compliance by the Company with the foregoing will constitute a cure of any default or Event of Default for failing to so comply with its obligations to issue and deliver Common Shares to the Holder pursuant to Section (4)(b)(i)(1) to which the Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion of any Conversion Amount; provided, the Company shall only be permitted to cure such an Event of Default for failing to comply with its obligations to issue and deliver Common Shares to the Holder by timely satisfying its obligations under this Section (4)(b)(ii) and for which the Holder exercised its Buy-in right on two (2) occasions during the term of this Debenture, and any subsequent Event of Default for failing to comply with its obligations to issue and deliver Common Shares to the Holder and for which the Holder exercised its Buy-in right shall not be curable by timely satisfying its obligations under this Section (4)(b)(ii). 3.

For the purposes hereof, if the Company in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities (other than shares issued or sold by the Company in connection with any Excluded Securities) and the lowest price per share for which one Common Share is issuable upon such conversion or exchange or exercise thereof is less than the Applicable Price (without giving effect to any make-whole shares issuable in connection with a fundamental change, change of control, delisting or liquidation or dissolution or a redemption (in each case, however so defined)), then such Common Shares shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. No further adjustment of the Fixed Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Shares upon conversion or exchange or exercise of such Convertible Securities. Q. Other Events . If any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of Section (5)(a) or (b) but not expressly provided for by such provisions, then the Company s Board of Directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the Fixed Price so as to protect the rights of the Holder under this Debenture; provided that no such adjustment will increase the Fixed Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section (5). If the Company issues 
 48 

 any Convertible Securities with a variable conversion formula that is more favorable than this Debenture, then at the option of the Holder, the Market Price formula shall be changed to match that of the new Convertible Securities (it being understood that a customary make-whole provision for conversions in connection with certain change of control transactions, delisting events or the approval of a liquidation or dissolution or redemptions does not constitute a variable conversion formula). R. Other Corporate Events . In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of Common Shares are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Shares (a Corporate Event ), the Company shall make appropriate provision to ensure that the Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of this Debenture such securities or other assets received by the holders of Common Shares in connection with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as the Holder would have been entitled to receive had this Debenture initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to Common Shares) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Price (as of the effective date of the Corporate Event). Provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders. The provisions of this Section (5)(d) shall apply similarly and equally to successive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of this Debenture. S. Whenever the Fixed Price, Market Price formula or Floor Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section (5), the Company shall promptly provide the Holder with a written notice setting forth the Fixed Price, Market Price formula and Floor Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. T. Whenever there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Shares of any shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, that are, or, when issued, will be, listed or admitted for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange (a Spin-Off ), the Fixed Price shall be decreased based on the following formula: FxP 1 = FxP 0 MP 0 FMV + MP 0 
 where, FxP 0 = the Fixed Price in effect immediately prior to the end of the Fx Valuation Period; FxP 1 = the Fixed Price in effect immediately after the end of the Fx Valuation Period; FMV 0 = the average of the VWAP of the capital stock distributed to holders of the Common Shares applicable to one Common Share over the first 10 consecutive Trading Day period after, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date of the Spin-Off (the Fx Valuation Period and MP 0 = the average of the VWAP of the Common Shares over the Fx Valuation Period. 
 49 

 The decrease to the Fixed Price under the preceding paragraph shall occur on the last Trading Day of the Fx Valuation Period ; provided that if the relevant Conversion Date occurs during the Fx Valuation Period , references to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed to be replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Ex-Dividend Date of such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date in determining the Fixed Price U. Whenever there has been a Spin-Off, the Floor Price shall be decreased based on the following formula: FlP 1 = FxP 0 MP 0 FMV + MP 0 
 where, FlP 0 = the Floor Price in effect immediately prior to the end of the Fl Valuation Period; FlP 1 = the Floor Price in effect immediately after the end of the Fl Valuation Period; FMV 0 = the average of the VWAP of the capital stock distributed to holders of the Common Shares applicable to one Common Share over the first 10 consecutive Trading Day period after, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date of the Spin-Off (the Fl Valuation Period and MP 0 = the average of the VWAP of the Common Shares over the Fl Valuation Period. The decrease to the Floor Price under the preceding paragraph shall occur on the last Trading Day of the Fl Valuation Period; provided that if the relevant Conversion Date occurs during the Fl Valuation Period, references to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed to be replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Ex-Dividend Date of such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date in determining the Floor Price.
