These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our industry and market sizes, and future opportunities for us. Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 
 In addition to factors identified elsewhere in this Report, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 
 our ability to remain a going concern; 
 risk that we may not be able to execute our growth strategies or achieve profitability; 
 risk that we will not be able to raise additional capital to execute our business plan, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, or pay our debts as they come due; 
 restrictions in our existing and any future credit facilities; 
 risks of operations in China; 
 the effects of mechanics liens filed by contractors that we do not have sufficient funds to pay; 
 the effects of existing and future litigation;

 changes in availability and price of raw materials; 
 labor relations, including the ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and contract personnel;

 risk that we are unable to secure or protect our intellectual property; 
 risk that our customers or third-party suppliers are unable to meet their obligations fully or in a timely manner; 
 risk that our customers will adjust, cancel or suspend their orders for our products; 
 risk of product liability or regulatory lawsuits or proceedings relating to our products or services; 
 the effectiveness of our information technology and operational technology systems and practices to detect and defend against evolving cyberattacks; 
 changing laws regarding cybersecurity and data privacy, and any cybersecurity threat or event;

and , gross profit of and , net profit of and net loss of , and operating cash outflow of and , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Group reported revenues of and , gross profit of and , net loss of (including a impairment loss from long-lived assets) and , and operating cash outflow of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Group had working capital of , shareholders' equity of (including an accumulated deficit of ), and cash and cash equivalents of . The Group also held outstanding borrowings of , with due within the next 12 months, and other current liabilities of , which include accounts payable, notes payable, and accrued expenses. Additionally, the Group had in purchase commitments primarily related to inventory as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Group has made significant investments to expand its capacity, particularly in its Huzhou, China, and Clarksville, Tennessee facilities. The Huzhou Phase 3.1 expansion is now contributing revenue following its completion in the third quarter of 2023 and the Huzhou Phase 3.2 expansion is in process which requires additional capital expenditure. The Tennessee expansion has been paused. Initially intended to produce 53.5Ah cells for the Group's ESS solutions, the Tennessee facility is now being evaluated for a potential shift to lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cell production, which better aligns with the Group s evolving ESS strategy. The Tennessee facility will require additional financing, and the timing for resuming the project is currently under review. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Group had outstanding payables of related to the Tennessee facility. The Group is actively working with suppliers. Some of those suppliers have filed liens while others have entered settlement agreements that include payment adjustments and lien releases. 
 
 The above factors raise substantial doubt about the Group s ability to continue as a going concern within the next twelve months from the date of issuance of its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Management has secured a bank loan in the third quarter of 2024, with an additional received in October 2024. Further details can be found in Note 7 Bank Borrowings.Workforce reductions were made in the U.S. during the second and third quarters of 2024, delivering cost savings and enhanced cash flow. Further plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include: 
 
 Operational Improvements: With profitability achieved in the third quarter of 2024, management expects that continued execution of its strategies will generate positive cash flow from operations over the next twelve months. 
 
 Asset Sales: The Group is actively pursuing the sale of non-core U.S. real estate assets, with an expectation of increasing liquidity without affecting core operations. 
 
 Additional Funding Options: Although no additional binding financing agreement has been entered into besides those disclosed in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Group is actively engaged in discussions with third parties to explore further funding options.

 The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at lease inception. Operating leases are required to record in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients, which allows the Company not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts as of the adoption date are or contain a lease, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases as of the adoption date and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases as of the adoption date. The Company also elected the practical expedient not to separate lease and non-lease components of contracts. Lastly, for lease assets other than real estate, such as printing machines and electronic appliances, the Company elected the short-term lease exemption as their lease terms are 12 months or less. 
 As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated in a portfolio approach to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments in a similar economic environment. Lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

During the first half year of 2024, the Company decided to pause the construction of the battery plant in Tennessee until additional funding for the remaining capital expenditure is secured. As a result, the Company reassessed the recoverability of the long-lived assets in the U.S. and utilized the residual method to estimate the fair value of the plant under construction located in Tennessee. For other long-lived assets in the U.S., the Company estimated market value or estimated cash flow from disposition of the assets. The Company recorded impairment loss of long-lived assets of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in operating expenses. The Company recorded impairment loss of long-lived assets of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in operating expenses.

 Restricted Stock Units 
 Following the Business Combination, the Company granted restricted stock units RSUs and performance-based restricted stock units PSUs subject to service, performance and/or market conditions. The service condition requires the participant s continued services or employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date, and the performance condition requires the achievement of the performance criteria defined in the award agreement. The market condition is based on the Company s TSR relative to a comparator group during a specified performance period. 
 The fair value of RSUs is determined by the market closing price of Common Stock at the grant date and is amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. The fair value of PSUs that include vesting based on market conditions are estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method. For PSUs with performance conditions, share-based compensation expense is only recognized if the performance conditions become probable to be satisfied. Compensation cost for these awards is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. Accordingly, the Company recorded share-based compensation expense of and related to these RSUs and and related to these PSUs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded share-based compensation expense of and related to these RSUs and and related to these PSUs, respectively.

 The Group is also involved in other litigation, claims, and proceedings. The Group evaluates the status of each legal matter and assesses the potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceedings or litigation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Group accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of a loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimated. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, based on the information currently available, the Group believes that any loss contingencies that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings cannot be accurately quantified at this time and thus cannot determine whether they will have a material adverse effect on the Group s business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 References in this Report to the Company, Microvast Holdings, Inc., Microvast, our, us or we refer to Microvast Holdings, Inc. The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim condensed financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 
 
 Business 
 Microvast Holdings, Inc., an advanced battery technology company, is headquartered in Stafford, Texas, and publicly traded on the NASDAQ. We specialize in the design, development, and manufacturing of high-performance lithium-ion battery systems and components, primarily for electric commercial vehicles ('EVs') and utility-scale energy storage systems ('ESS'). Since our inception in 2006, our mission has been to drive the transition to clean energy by accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions through innovative battery technology. 
 Our company was founded on the principle of true innovation in battery design eschewing legacy technologies and embracing a fresh, pioneering approach to lithium-ion battery development. This ethos distinguishes Microvast from competitors who have adapted existing battery technologies to new markets, such as electric vehicles. We focus on ground-up innovation to address the specific needs of these evolving sectors. 
 Microvast has a fully vertically integrated approach to battery development, allowing us to control every aspect of the production process, from cell materials (cathode, anode, electrolyte, separator) to system cooling and proprietary software controls. This capability enables us to innovate across the entire battery system, improving efficiency, energy density, charging speed, and safety, which are critical for commercial EVs and energy storage systems. 
 Our flagship product is the 53.5Ah high-energy nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) battery cell, which is designed specifically for electric vehicles. The 53.5Ah cell combines fast charging capabilities, high energy density, and long cycle life, making it an ideal solution for demanding commercial applications. To bring this product to market, we have made significant investments in our fully automated production facilities in Huzhou, China, which now supports large-scale production of the 53.5Ah cell. 
 Since the launch of our first ultra-fast charging battery system in 2009, we have delivered approximately 5,576.4 megawatt hours MWh of battery systems for electric vehicles. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we reported a 27 increase in revenue, reaching 101.4 million compared to 80.1 million in the same period in 2023. Our order backlog as of September 30, 2024, stands at 277.7 million for EV battery systems, representing approximately 1,144.1 MWh, with over 58 of these orders attributable to Europe and U.S. markets. We expect to fulfill a majority of our electric vehicle battery backlog within 2024 and 2025. 
 Looking forward, Microvast aims to expand its focus on ESS to capitalize on the growing demand for renewable energy solutions. We are committed to becoming a global leader in the ESS market, recognizing that electric vehicles are only as green as the energy that powers them. Addressing this relationship between clean energy and electrification is at the core of our research and development strategy and will shape our future growth. 
 We originally intended to produce 53.5Ah cells from our Clarksville, Tennessee facility for our ESS and EV products and had made significant investments in our capacity expansion there. However, due to market demand, regulation policies, and our competitors lowering their selling prices, we believe lithium iron phosphate LFP cells are a better battery fit for our ESS solutions and intend to produce LFP cells from our Tennessee facility instead of 53.5Ah cells. As such, we expect that all of our production of 53.5Ah cells will be from our facilities in China, and in the United States we will focus on LFP production for our energy storage solutions to customers worldwide. We believe this strategic shift towards LFP technology in the U.S. leverages cost benefits, safety features, regulatory compliance, and lower environmental impact for the following reasons: 
 
 Production and Application Suitability. While NMC batteries provide high energy density and performance suitable for electric vehicles, we believe these characteristics are less critical for energy storage systems. LFP batteries, in contrast, offer performance parameters that align well with ESS requirements due to their stability and durability over longer discharge periods. 
 
 Cost Efficiency and Resource Utilization. LFP batteries are generally 20-40 less expensive per kilowatt-hour compared to NMC batteries. We believe this cost advantage, coupled with the reduced reliance on scarce minerals such as cobalt, makes LFP an economically and environmentally preferable choice for ESS. The extended lifecycle of our LFP

 batteries enhances their cost-effectiveness over prolonged operational durations, presenting a compelling value proposition for large-scale energy storage applications. 
 
 Reliability Enhancements. LFP batteries demonstrate better structural stability and higher thermal thresholds, reducing risks associated with overheating and thermal runaway. Our proprietary technology, which incorporates nitrogen protection systems within our ESS containers, further enhances the reliability profile of our ESS solutions, demonstrating our dedication to risk mitigation in the energy storage sector. 
 
 Tax Incentives. Our domestically produced LFP batteries and energy storage containers are expected to qualify with U.S. domestic content requirements and qualify for the Inflation Reduction Act Section 45X energy efficiency incentives, thereby enhancing the economic viability of our ESS solutions. 
 
 Environmental Impact. LFP batteries do not contain cobalt, which is often associated with significant environmental degradation and ethical concerns related to its mining practices. This attribute underscores our commitment to environmental sustainability and positions LFP batteries as a more eco-friendly option in the energy storage market. 
 
 While we believe these advantages make LFP batteries better suited for meeting the current and future demands of our ESS solutions, we are in the early stages of exploring this new product which is currently in the pilot stage in China. We can provide no assurance as to whether and when our LFP product will become available, when our Clarksville, Tennessee facility will be completed, or if our LFP batteries will ever be marketable. The lithium-based battery market is highly competitive and there can be no assurance that the use of our LFP product or ESS solutions will gain market acceptance. Additionally, we might encounter practical difficulties and may incur additional costs during the scale-up of our LFP operations. 
 
 Completion of the Business Combination 
 On July 23, 2021, Microvast Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Tuscan Holdings Corp.) consummated the previously announced acquisition of Microvast, Inc., a Delaware corporation, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 1, 2021, between Tuscan, Microvast and TSCN Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Microvast, with Microvast surviving the merger. 
 
 Going Concern 
 In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 205-40, Going Concern, we evaluate whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This evaluation includes considerations related to our liquidity resource. Given the uncertainties around our liquidity as described in Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report and in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of the unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. For more information, see Note 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report and the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 "There is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern", "We may be unable to meet our current capital requirements and will require additional capital to meet our outstanding accounts payable and current liabilities". 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe that our future success will be dependent on several factors, including those discussed below. While these areas represent opportunities for us, they also represent challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to continue the growth of our business and improve our results of operations. 
 Technology and Product Innovation 
 Our financial performance is driven by development and sales of new products with innovative technology. Our ability to develop innovative technology has been and will continue to be dependent on our dedicated research team. As part of our efforts to develop innovative technology, in October 2021, we expanded our R D footprint in the U.S. We also plan to continue leveraging our knowledge base in our overseas locations, including China and to continue expanding our R D efforts on a global basis. We expect our results of operations will continue to be impacted by our ability to develop new products with improved performance and reduced ownership cost, as well as the cost of our R D efforts.

 Market Demand 
 Our revenue and profitability depend substantially on the demand for battery systems and battery components, which is driven by the growth of the commercial and passenger electric vehicle and energy storage markets. Many factors contribute to the development of the electric vehicle and battery energy storage sector, including product innovation, general economic and political conditions, environmental concerns, energy demand, government support and economic incentives (e.g., the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and the E.U. Green Deal, E.U. Fit for 55). While governmental economic incentives and mandates can drive market demand for the markets in which we operate and, as a result, battery systems and components, governmental economic incentives can always be gradually reduced or eliminated. Any reduction or elimination of governmental economic incentives may result in reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our financial performance. 
 Manufacturing Capacity 
 Our growth depends on being able to meet anticipated demand for our products. As of September 30, 2024, we had a backlog of approximately 277.7 million for our electric vehicles battery systems, equivalent to approximately 1,144.1 MWh. To increase our manufacturing output, address our backlog and capture growing market opportunities, we have made significant investment in capacity expansions in both Huzhou, China and Tennessee, United States. 
 In the third quarter of 2023, we successfully completed the 2 GWh cell, module and tray capacity expansion for our 53.5Ah cell technology in Huzhou, China which is now in operation and generating revenue from sales of electric battery systems. 
 The Tennessee expansion was originally scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was intended for production of 53.5Ah cells for our ESS solutions. However, we believe LFP cells are a better battery fit for our ESS solutions and intend to produce LFP cells from the Tennessee facility instead of 53.5Ah cells. As such, we expect that all our production of 53.5Ah cells will be from our facilities in China, and in the United States we will focus on LFP production for our energy storage solutions to customers worldwide. Additionally, our ESS products previously assembled in Colorado are now planned to be assembled at our Tennessee facility. In order to complete the Tennessee expansion, we need to secure financing to meet the remaining capital expenditure needs, and the timing of when this project will be in operation remains uncertain. We are in the process of evaluating the amount of capital expenditures needed to complete the Tennessee expansion in light of the intended production shift from NMC cells to LFP cells. 
 Future capacity expansions will require significant capital expenditures and will require a corresponding expansion of our supporting infrastructure, further development of our sales and marketing team, an expansion of our customer base and strengthened quality control. This capacity expansion will be carried out in a measured manner based on our ongoing assessment of medium- and long-term demand for our solutions. 
 Sales Geographic Mix 
 After initially being focused on the Asia Pacific regions, we have expanded and continue to expand our presence and product promotion to Europe and the U.S. to capitalize on the rapidly growing electric vehicle and battery energy storage markets in those geographies. As we continue to expand our geographic focus to Europe and the U.S., we believe sales of our products in Europe and the U.S. will have the potential to generate higher gross margins because average sales prices for customers in Europe and the U.S. are typically significantly higher than the average sales prices in China. It has been our experience that buyers in Europe and the U.S. are more motivated by the technologies and quality of our products than are buyers in China, making them less sensitive to the price of our products than are similarly situated buyers in China where we are also faced with intense competition from local Chinese battery manufacturers. Therefore, the geographic sources of our revenue will have an impact on our revenue and gross margins. 
 Manufacturing Costs 
 Our profitability may also be affected by our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing costs are affected by fluctuations in the price of raw materials. If raw material prices increase, we will have to offset these higher costs either through price increases to our customers or through productivity improvements. Our ability to control our raw materials costs is also dependent on our ability to negotiate with our suppliers for a better price and our ability to source raw materials from reliable suppliers in a cost-efficient manner. In addition, we expect that an increase in our sales volume will enable us to lower our manufacturing costs through economies of scale.

 Regulatory Landscape 
 We operate in an industry that is subject to many established environmental regulations, which have generally become more stringent over time, particularly with respect to hazardous waste generation and disposal and pollution control. These regulations affect the cost of our products and our gross margins. We are also affected by regulations in our target markets, such as economic incentives to purchasers of electric vehicles, tax credits for electric vehicle manufacturers or developers of renewable energy projects, and economic penalties that may apply to a car manufacturer based on its fleet-wide emissions or more generally legislation aimed at reducing GHGs. Each of these regulations may expand the market size for both electric vehicles and energy storage , which would, in turn, benefit us. We have operations and sales in China, the Asia Pacific region, Europe and the U.S. and, as a result, changes in trade restrictions and tariffs could impact our ability to meet projected sales or margins. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 We currently conduct our business through one operating segment. Our historical results are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in U.S. dollars. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 We derive revenue from the sales of our electric battery products, including LpTO, LpCO, MpCO, HpCO and HnCo battery power systems. While we have historically marketed and sold our products primarily in China and the wider Asia-Pacific region, While we have historically marketed and sold our products primarily in China and the broader Asia-Pacific region, we are also expanding our international sales presence, with notable revenue growth in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) region. This expansion reflects increasing demand and positive growth trends in EMEA as we continue to broaden our global market reach. The following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue by major geographic regions in which our customers are located, for the periods indicated:

 Revenue from such customers represented less than 10 of our revenue during the respective periods. 
 Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit 
 
 Cost of revenues includes direct and indirect materials, manufacturing overhead (including depreciation, freight and logistics), warranty reserves and expenses, write-down of obsolete inventories, and labor costs and related personnel expenses, including stock-based compensation and other related expenses that are directly attributable to the manufacturing of products. 
 Gross profit is equal to revenues less cost of revenues. Gross profit margin is equal to gross profit divided by revenues. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses consist of selling and marketing, general and administrative and research and development expenses. 
 Selling and marketing expenses . Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs associated with our sales and marketing functions, including share-based compensation, and other expenses related to advertising and promotions of our products. We intend to hire additional sales personnel, initiate additional marketing programs and build additional relationships with our customers. Accordingly, we expect that our selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the long term as we expand our business. 
 General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses associated with our executive team members, including share-based compensation, legal, finance, human resource and information technology functions, as well as fees for professional services, depreciation and amortization and insurance expenses. We expect to incur additional costs as we hire personnel and enhance our infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business. 
 Research and development expenses . Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including share-based compensation, raw material expenses relating to materials used for experiments, utility expenses and depreciation expenses attributable to research and development activities. Over time, we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to make significant investments in developing new products, applications, functionality and other offerings.

 Subsidy Income 
 Government subsidies represent government grants received from local government authorities. The amounts of and conditions attached to each subsidy were determined at the sole discretion of the relevant governmental authorities. Our subsidy income is non-recurring in nature. 
 Other Income and Expenses 
 Other income and expenses consist primarily of interest expense associated with our debt financing arrangements, interest income earned on our cash balances, gains and losses from foreign exchange conversion, and gains and losses on disposal of assets. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business, namely the PRC, Germany and the UK. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the U.S. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the absorption of foreign tax credits, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from the examination of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ), and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our income tax reserves and expense. Should actual events or results differ from our current expectations, charges or credits to our income tax expense may become necessary. Any such adjustments could have a significant impact on our results of operations. 
 Income tax in the PRC is generally calculated at 25 of the estimated assessable profit of our subsidiaries in the PRC, except that two of our PRC subsidiaries were qualified as High and New Tech Enterprises and thus enjoyed a preferential income tax rate of 15 . Federal corporate income tax rate of 21 is applied for our U.S. entity. Income tax in the UK is calculated at an average tax rate of 19 of the estimated assessable profit of our subsidiary in the UK. German enterprise income tax, which is a combination of corporate income tax and trade tax, is calculated at 29.9 of the estimated assessable profit of our subsidiary in Germany.

The decrease in Research and Development expenses was primarily due to 2.8 million of decreased share-based compensation expenses, offset by other investments in R D activities. 
 
 Impairment loss of long-lived assets 
 
 The impairment loss of long-lived assets was 64.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by a 64.8 million impairment loss in our U.S. operations in the second quarter of 2024. During the first half year of 2024, we initiated a strategic shift towards LFP technology in the U.S., and we decided to pause the construction of our battery plant in Tennessee until additional funding for the remaining capital expenditure is secured. As a result of these events and circumstances in the second quarter, we conducted impairment testing for our long-lived assets in the U.S. and recognized an impairment loss of 64.8 million. 
 
 Other income 
 
 For the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 7.9 million of other income mainly due to 7.7 million gain on the payable concession during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Changes in fair value of warrant and convertible loan 
 
 For the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a gain of 1.2 million mainly due to the change in fair value of convertible loan with shareholder of 1.2 million, details please see Note 14 Convertible loan with shareholder measured at fair value. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily from capital contributions from equity holders, the issuance of convertible notes and bank borrowings. 
 
 The consolidated net cash position as of September 30, 2024 included cash and cash equivalents of 29.6 million and 19.3 million held by our PRC and European subsidiaries, respectively, that is not available to fund our U.S. operations unless funds are repatriated. Should we need to repatriate to the U.S. part or all of the funds held by our international subsidiaries in the form of a dividend, we would need to accrue and pay withholding taxes. We do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and intend to retain all of the available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business in the PRC, Europe and the U.S. 
 
 In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), management has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued and has determined that the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital or secure financing. In light of the capital expenditures required to settle the outstanding payables associated with the Group's Tennessee expansion and operating requirements under its current business plan, the Company is projecting that its existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditure needs through 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 the next twelve months from the date of issuance of its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Management has secured a 29,911 bank loan in the third quarter of 2024, with an additional 9,962 received in October 2024. Further details can be found in Note 7- Bank Borrowings. Workforce reductions were made in the U.S. during the second and third quarters of 2024, delivering cost savings and enhanced cash flow. Further plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include: 
 
 1. Operational Improvements: With profitability achieved in the third quarter of 2024, management expects that continued execution of its strategies will generate positive cash flow from operations over the next twelve months. 
 
 2. Asset Sales: The Group is actively pursuing the sale of non-core U.S. real estate assets, with an expectation of increasing liquidity without affecting core operations. 
 
 3. Additional Funding Options: Although no additional binding financing agreement has been entered into besides those disclosed in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Group is actively engaged in discussions with third parties to explore further funding options. 
 
 These plans are not final and are subject to market and other conditions not within our control. As such, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient capital. Accordingly, management has concluded under the accounting standards that these plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Should sufficient capital not be secured through the plans, or should there be a delay in the timing of securing capital through these alternatives, this would have adverse implications for the Company and our shareholders. In these scenarios, we will need to seek other options, including delaying or reducing operating and capital expenditure and the possibility of an alternative transaction. 
 
 Financings 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had bank borrowings of 119.6 million, the terms of which range from 1 to 27 months. The interest rates on our bank borrowings ranged from 3.30 to 4.85 per annum. As of September 30, 2024, we had convertible bonds outstanding of 43.2 million, with interest rates ranging from 3 to 4 . The convertible bonds are all due in 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we also had the Convertible loan with shareholder of 24.4 million outstanding at an initial interest rate equal to Term SOFR for the applicable interest period, plus an initial applicable margin of 9.75 per annum, 3.75 of which shall be paid in kind and added to the outstanding principal under the Convertible loan with shareholder, with the remaining interest to be paid in cash. See Note 14 for details. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all material terms and covenants of our loan agreements, credit agreements and bonds. 
 
 On July 23, 2021, we received 708.4 million from the completion of the Business Combination, 705.1 million net of transaction costs paid by Microvast, Inc. We have used 469.3 million of the net proceeds from the Business Combination to expand our manufacturing facilities and for the purchase of property and equipment associated with our existing manufacturing and R D facilities. In addition, 181.3 million of the net proceeds were used for working capital as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Capital expenditures and other contractual obligations 
 Our capital expenditures amounted to 150.9 million and 186.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Our capital expenditures in 2022 and 2023 related primarily to the construction of manufacturing facilities in Huzhou, China and Clarksville, Tennessee. The Huzhou, China expansion was completed in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Because of delays in securing additional financing, including our fund-raising process being negatively impacted by the loss of the DOE grant, in the fourth quarter of 2023 we experienced slow progress in continuing construction of our Clarksville, Tennessee expansion, slowing down certain project work streams due to the need for additional financing. This resulted in further delays and increased costs with negative effects on our liquidity and ability to meet accounts payable, especially for our U.S. operations. The Tennessee expansion was originally scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was intended for production of 53.5Ah cells for our ESS solutions. However, we now believe LFP cells are a better battery fit for our ESS solutions and intend to produce LFP cells from the Tennessee facility instead of 53.5Ah cells. In order to complete the Tennessee expansion, we need to secure financing to meet the remaining capital expenditure needs, and the timing of when this project will be in operation remains uncertain. We are in the process of evaluating the amount of capital expenditures needed to complete the Tennessee expansion in light of the intended production shift from NMC cells to LFP cells.

Further, due to the working capital needs of MPS China and adverse tax consequences as well as foreign restrictions, we are unable to repatriate cash from China to pay our accounts payable in the U.S. and fund the continued expansion of our U.S. operations. We are in discussions with third parties to assess strategic alternatives, including ways to enhance our liquidity and/or the sale or disposal of certain U.S. real estate assets that are not integral to the our cell manufacturing or assembly operations. Until financing is in place, this will limit our growth opportunities especially in the U.S. market. Also, we will be forgoing potential Inflation Reduction Act credits until such time as the Clarksville, Tennessee expansion is in operation. 
 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to funding planned production capacity expansions and for general working capital. In addition, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or technologies. We may need to seek additional equity or debt financing in order to meet these future capital requirements. If we are unable to raise additional capital or secure financing when desired, or on terms that are acceptable to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. There are no material off-balance sheet arrangements other than those described below. 
 
 Lease Commitments 
 
 We lease certain facilities and equipment under non-cancellable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2036. For additional information, see Note 12 Leases, in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Purchase Commitments 
 
 We regularly enter into non-cancelable contractual obligations primarily related to purchases of inventory. As of September 30, 2024, such purchase commitments, which do not qualify for recognition on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, amount to 52.3 million , most of which is short-term. 
 
 There have not been any other material changes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to our contractual obligations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table provides a summary of our cash flow data for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 
 2023 
 Amount in thousands Net cash used in operating activities (3,287) (70,350) Net cash used in investing activities (11,972) (153,120) Net cash generated from financing activities 46,635 12,153 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating activities used 3.3 million in cash. This decrease in cash consisted of (1) a net loss of 90.0 million and non-cash charges of 135.2 million, of which 22.4 million is depreciation of property, plant and equipment, 30.3 million is non-cash share-based compensation expense and 64.9 million is impairment loss from long-lived asset; and (2) a 48.5 million decrease in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities including 27.3 million cash inflow due to the net decrease of accounts receivable and notes receivable, 4.1 million increase in inventories, 54.7 million cash outflow from accounts payable and notes payable, 30.8 million cash outflow from accrued and other liabilities and prepaid expense and other current asset, and 13.8 million cash inflow from other operating assets and liabilities.

Table of Contents 

 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities totaled 12.0 million. This cash outflow primarily consisted of capital expenditures related to the expansion of our manufacturing facilities and to the purchase of property and equipment associated with our existing manufacturing and R D facilities. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash generated from financing activities totaled 46.6 million. This cash inflow was a result of 70.4 million proceeds from bank borrowings and 25.0 million proceeds from Convertible loan offset by 31.9 million repayment on bank borrowings and 0.5 million of debt cost for Convertible loan, 16.4 million of deferred payment related to purchases of property, plant and equipment. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 There have been no substantial changes to these estimates, or the policies related to them during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, except for the impairment of long-lived assets illustrated in below paragraphs. For other discussion of these estimates and policies, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment ASC 360 ), we evaluate our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired due to the carrying amount of an asset group not being recoverable. When the projected undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded as a component of operating expenses. For assets held for sales, the amount of potential impairment may be based upon appraisal of the asset, estimated market value of similar assets or estimated cash flow from the disposition of the asset. The evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. 
 
 During the first half year of 2024, we decided to pause the construction of the battery plant in Tennessee until additional funding for the remaining capital expenditure is secured. As a result, we reassessed the recoverability of the long-lived assets in the U.S. and utilized the residual method to estimate the fair value of the plant under construction located in Tennessee. For other long-lived assets in the U.S. to be dispose, we estimated market value or estimated cash flow from disposition of the assets. As a result of the assessment, we recorded impairment loss of long-lived assets 0.0 million and 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in operating expenses. We recorded impairment loss of long-lived assets of 64.9 million and 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in operating expenses. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Exposure Risk 
 Our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market accounts. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. To date, fluctuations in interest income have not been significant. In addition, our bonds payable bear interest at fixed rates and are not publicly traded. Our project finance loans in China contain a spread of 115 basis points over the Loan Prime Rate in China and accordingly are exposed to movements in that reference rate. Therefore, interest expense going forward could be materially affected by changes in the market interest rates. 
 The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. Because our cash equivalents have a short maturity, our portfolio s fair value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. We do not believe that an increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 would have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. In future periods, we will continue to evaluate our investment policy in order to ensure that we continue to meet our overall objectives. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We have a large operational presence in China and a significant amount of our transactions are currently denominated in RMB. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our operating results as a result of transaction gains and losses related to translating certain cash balances, trade accounts receivable and payable balances, and intercompany balances that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally RMB. The effect of an immediate 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates on Renminbi-denominated accounts as of September 30, 2024, including intercompany balances, would result in a foreign currency loss of 15.6 million. In the event our foreign sales and expenses increase, our operating results may be more affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which we do business. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the impact hedging activities would have on our results of operations. 
 Credit Risk 
 Our credit risk primarily relates to our trade and other receivables, restricted cash, cash equivalents and amounts due from related parties. We generally grant credit only to clients and related parties with good credit ratings and also closely monitor overdue debts. In this regard, we consider that the credit risk arising from our balances with counterparties is significantly reduced. 
 The assumptions used in evaluating our exposure to credit losses associated with our financing receivables 
 portfolio involve estimates and significant judgment. Holding other estimates constant, a hypothetical 100 basis points 
 increase in the expected loss rate on the financing receivables portfolio would have resulted in an increase in the allowance 
 for credit losses of approximately 0.5 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 In order to minimize the credit risk, we have delegated a team responsible for determining credit limits, credit approvals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue debts. In addition, we review the recoverable amount of each individual debtor at the end of each reporting period to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made for irrecoverable amounts. We will negotiate with the counterparties of the debts for settlement plans or changes in credit terms, should the need arise. In this regard, we consider that our credit risk is significantly reduced. 
 Seasonality 
 We have historically experienced higher sales during our third and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to our first and second fiscal quarters. However, our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, as a result of the material weakness identified below. 
 In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Based on such analysis and notwithstanding the identified material weakness, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, believe the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report on Form 10-Q fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 Material Weakness 
 In connection with the audit of the financial year ended December 31, 2023, we identified certain control deficiencies in the design and operation of our internal controls over our financial reporting that constituted a material weakness in aggregation. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness that has been identified relates to the design and implementation of IT general controls for IT system that are relevant to the preparation of the financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain adequate user access controls to restrict user and privileged access to certain particular function of the ERP during the implementation, which could allow a skilled user with privileged access to access and potentially make changes to the system relevant to the preparation of the financial statements. 
 Material Weakness Remediation 
 Subsequent to the identification of the material weakness, we have taken steps to address the control deficiencies and implemented our remediation plan, which we believe addresses the underlying causes. We are executing on our remediation plan for the material weakness by removing all inappropriate access and establishing more robust processes to control the privileged access to our system including monthly review of the system log for any inappropriate access. While we believe these efforts have improved, and will continue to improve, our internal controls and address the underlying causes of the material weakness, the material weakness will not be remediated until our remediation plan has been fully implemented and tested and we have concluded that following the improvements, our IT general controls are operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 As described above, the Company is taking steps to remediate the material weakness noted above. Other than in connection with these remediation steps, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 For a description of our pending legal proceedings, please see Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. While the lawsuits are being vigorously defended, the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, and there is always the possibility that a court rules in a manner that is adverse to the interests of the Company and the individual defendants. However, the amount of any such loss in that scenario cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Regardless of the outcome, litigation has the potential to have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In evaluating us and our common stock, we urge you to carefully consider the risks and other information in this Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and other reports that we have filed with the SEC. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 There were no unregistered sales of our equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable.
