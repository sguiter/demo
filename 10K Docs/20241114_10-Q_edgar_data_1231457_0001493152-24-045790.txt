and used cash in operations of and had an accumulated
deficit of as of December 31, 2023. As reflected in the accompanying condensed financial statements, during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of and used cash in operations of . 

During
the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company closed its initial public offering IPO and two private placements and received
 of net proceeds from these offerings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company closed its second public offering
and received of net proceeds from that offering (see Note 8). Due to the funds received through these offerings, and the conversion
of preferred stock and convertible notes payable upon the closing of the IPO, the Company had shareholders equity of at
September 30, 2024. The Company now expects its cash and cash equivalents, and short and long-term investments, totaling at September
30, 2024, to last into the first quarter of 2026. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company attaining and maintaining profitable operations in the future and
raising additional capital to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.
Since inception, the Company has funded its operations primarily through equity and debt financings, and licensing income, and it expects
to continue to rely on these sources of capital in the future. 

No
assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to
the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the
case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing, or grant unfavorable terms in
future licensing agreements.

Under
certain of the Company s licensing, supply and collaboration agreements, it is entitled to receive payment upon the achievement
of contingent milestone events or the performance of obligations. The Company recognizes revenue based on guidance in ASC 606. In evaluating
revenue recognition under a license agreement, the Company uses a two-step process for determining whether a promised good or service
(including a license of intellectual property) is distinct and, therefore, is a performance obligation: (1) consideration of the individual
good or service (i.e., whether the good or service is capable of being distinct); and (2) consideration of whether the good or service
is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., whether the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct
in the context of the contract). Amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue
on the Company s balance sheet. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months following the balance sheet
date are classified as current liabilities. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of relating to its license agreement with ELIAS Animal Health,

Company s policy is to recognize compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight- line basis over the requisite
service period for the entire award. Additionally, the Company s policy is to issue new shares of common stock to satisfy stock
option exercises. The Company applied fair value accounting for all share-based payments awards. The fair value of each option granted
is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Overview 

Genelux
is a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a pipeline of next-generation oncolytic viral immunotherapies
for patients suffering from aggressive and/or difficult-to-treat solid tumor types. Our clinical and preclinical product candidates are
intended to selectively kill tumor cells and induce a robust immune response against a patient s tumor neoantigens. Importantly,
our oncolytic immunotherapy product candidates are off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapies. In other words, while we
administer the same virus product to different patients, the cellular immune response generated is expected to be specific to the unique
neoantigens in that patient. Our product candidate, Olvi-Vec (olvimulogene nanivacirepvec), is a proprietary, modified strain of the
vaccinia virus VACV ), a stable DNA virus with a large engineering capacity. 

Employing
our proprietary selection technology and discovery and development platform CHOICE ), we have developed an extensive library of isolated
and engineered oncolytic VACV immunotherapeutic product candidates. These provide potential utility in multiple tumor types in both the
monotherapy and combination therapy settings, via physician-preferred administration techniques, including regional (e.g., intraperitoneal),
local and systemic (e.g., intravenous) delivery routes. Informed by our CHOICE platform and supported by extensive clinical and preclinical
data, we believe we have the capacity to develop a pipeline of treatment options to address high unmet medical needs for those patients
with insignificant or unsatisfactory responses to standard-of-care therapies, including chemotherapies. 

Since
inception, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing
our technology, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking preclinical
and clinical studies and manufacturing. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product
sales. 

20 

Since
inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were 14.6 million and 16.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 236.1 million. We expect to continue
to incur significant and increasing expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future, as we advance our current and future product
candidates through preclinical and clinical development, manufacture drug product and drug supply, seek regulatory approval for our current
and future product candidates, maintain and expand our intellectual property portfolio, hire additional research and development and
business personnel and operate as a public company. 

We
will not generate revenue from commercially approved product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and
obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and do
not enter into a third-party commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization
capability to support product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution activities. 

As
a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until we can
generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private
equity offerings and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing
arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on acceptable
terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when needed, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2023, we closed our initial public offering IPO and two Private Placements and received 37.8
million of net proceeds from these offerings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we closed a second public offering and
received 27.7 million of net proceeds from that offering. Due to the funds received through these offerings, and the conversion of preferred
stock and convertible notes payable upon the closing of the IPO, we have shareholders equity of 33.1 million at September 30,
2024. We now expect our cash and cash equivalents, and short and long-term investments, totaling 35.1 million at September 30, 2024,
to last until the first quarter of 2026. 

Recent
Developments 

US-Based Phase 2 Trial in
NSCLC 

In
October 2024, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, and controlled clinical trial
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered Olvi-Vec oncolytic VACV for patients with recurrent
non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC in the United States. In accordance with our license agreement with our partner in
China, Newsoara BioPharma Co. Ltd. (Newsoara), Newsoara is generally obligated to fund the Phase 2 clinical trial in
its entirety. In November 2023, we agreed with Newsoara that Genelux would directly engage a
contract research organization on mutually agreeable terms to conduct certain startup activities for the NSCLC trial in the U.S.
only, with Newsoara reimbursing us for the costs and expenses of such agreed-upon startup activities. Newsoara is permitted to defer
such reimbursement payments until the completion of its next round of financing, which Newsoara expects to occur in 2024. During the
quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Services Agreement with Hong Kong Tigermed Consulting
Co., Ltd., to provide regulatory and development support services for the NSCLC trial in the U.S. The total amount of the contract
is up to 10.1 million. 

Officer Transition 

On October 18, 2024, Caroline Jewett resigned as Vice President, Head of
Quality of the Company. The Company recently appointed Andre Kopoyan, MBA, who was previously Director, Quality Assurance of the
Company, as Head of Quality (Interim).

Net
Sales 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, under our license agreement with Newsoara, we invoiced
and collected 0.2 million relating to supplying product for Newsoara to use in its clinical trials. During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, we recognized revenue of 0.01 million relating to the Company s license agreement with ELIAS Animal Health, LLC. 

Operating
Expenses 

Our
operating expenses consist of (i) research and development expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses. 

21 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research and development activities, including our product candidate
discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical studies under our research programs, which include: 

employee-related
 expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our research and development personnel; 

costs
 of funding research performed by third parties that conduct research and development and preclinical and clinical activities on our
 behalf; 

costs
 of manufacturing drug product and drug supply related to our current or future product candidates; 

costs
 of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates; 

consulting
 and professional fees related to research and development activities, including equity-based compensation to non-employees; 

costs
 of maintaining our laboratory, including purchasing laboratory supplies and non-capital equipment used in our preclinical studies; 

costs
 related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements; and 

facility
 costs and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, depreciation and other
 supplies. 

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to
completion of specific tasks using data such as information provided to us by our vendors and analyzing the progress of our preclinical
and clinical studies or other services performed. Significant judgement and estimates are made in determining the accrued expense balances
at the end of any reporting period. 

The
successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. We cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and estimated
costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete development of our current or future product candidates. We are also unable to
predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from the sale of our product candidates, if they are approved. This is
due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including the uncertainty of: 

the
 scope, rate of progress, and expenses of our ongoing research activities as well as any preclinical studies and clinical trials and
 other research and development activities; 

establishing
 an appropriate safety profile; 

successful
 enrollment in and completion of clinical trials; 

whether
 our product candidates show safety and efficacy in our clinical trials; 

receipt
 of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

establishing
 commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; 

obtaining
 and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; 

commercializing
 product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and 

continued
 acceptable safety profile of the products following any regulatory approval. 

22 

A
change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our current and future product candidates would significantly
change the costs and timing associated with the development of those product candidates. 

Research
and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have
higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage
clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we commence clinical
trials and continue the development of our current and future product candidates. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this
time to accurately project expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization
of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined
with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control
will impact our clinical development programs and plans. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses include salaries and other compensation-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel
in executive, finance and accounting, business development, operations and administrative roles. Other significant costs include professional
service and consulting fees, including legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, accounting fees, recruiting
costs and costs for consultants who we utilize to supplement our personnel, insurance costs, travel costs, facility and office-related
costs not included in research and development expenses. 

We
anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as our business expands to support expected growth
in research and development activities, including our future clinical programs. These increases will likely include increased costs related
to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside service providers, among other expenses. We also anticipate increased expenses
associated with being a public company, including costs for audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services related to compliance with
the rules and regulations of the SEC, and listing standards applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, director
and officer insurance premiums, and investor relations costs. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates
and do not enter into a third-party commercialization collaboration, we expect to incur significant expenses related to building a sales
and marketing team to support product sales, marketing and distribution activities.

expense in 2024, due to the increase in the cost of stock options and restricted stock units in 2024; offset by a 0.3 million decrease
in professional service expenses in 2024, primarily resulting from decreased corporate legal costs. 

Other
Expenses, net 

Other
income (expenses), net, were 0.5 million and (0.4) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income consisted of interest income of 0.5 million from the investment into money market
funds and short and long-term investments, while during the same period in 2023, other income consisted of interest income of 0.04 million
and financing costs of 0.4 million.

increase of 3.9 million. Significant variations between periods are the result of a 0.9 million increase in employee compensation and
related expenses in 2024, primarily due to new employee hires after the second quarter of 2023; a 1.1 million increase in stock-related
compensation in 2024, relating to the increased cost of stock options and restricted stock units in 2024; a 0.7 million increase in
outsourced manufacturing services in 2024, primarily related to increased costs of third-party product testing and other manufacturing
processes; and a 1.7 million increase in clinical and regulatory expenses in 2024, relating to increased clinical trial costs associated
with our Phase 3 On Prime Registration trial in 2024; offset by a 0.5 decrease in the manufacturing and laboratory material costs
and consulting and contract labor expenses.

Other
Income (Expenses), net 

Other
income (expenses), net, were 1.1 million and (4.3) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income consisted of interest income of 1.1 million from the investment into money market
funds and short and long-term investments, while during the same period in 2023, other income consisted of interest income of 0.004 million
from the investment into money market funds. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other
expenses consisted of interest expense of 0.2 million, debt discount amortization of 0.6 million, financing costs of 3.2 million and
debt extinguishment costs of 0.4 million. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

During
the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a net loss of 28.3 million and used cash in operations of 20.3 million and had an accumulated
deficit of 221.5 million as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 20.9 million
and used cash in operations of 16.9 million. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we closed our IPO and two Private Placements and received 37.8 million of net proceeds
from the offerings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we closed our secondary public offering and received 27.7
million of net proceeds from that offering. Due to the funds received through these offerings, and the conversion of preferred stock
and convertible notes payable upon the closing of the IPO, we had shareholders equity of 33.1 million at September 30, 2024.
We now expect our cash and cash equivalents, and short and long-term investments, totaling 35.1 million at September 30, 2024, to
last into the first quarter of 2026. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our attaining and maintaining profitable operations in the future and raising
additional capital to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Since
inception, we have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings, and licensing income, and we expect to continue
to rely on these sources of capital in the future. 

No
assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to
us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing,
or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing, or grant unfavorable terms in licensing future licensing
agreements.

Operating
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used cash from operating activities of 16.9 million, compared to 13.4 million used during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 20.9 million and
had non-cash expenses of 6.1 million, compared to a net loss of 21.5 million and non-cash expenses of 9.4 million during the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The primary non-cash expense during both periods was stock-related compensation totaling 6.0 million
and 4.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and the fair value of warrants issued in connection
with the conversion of convertible notes of 3.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net change in operating
assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 used cash of 2.1 million, compared to 1.3 million used during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary source of cash relating to operating assets and liabilities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 0.3 million and the primary use of cash was the
decrease in accrued payroll and payroll taxes of 1.4 million. The primary use of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2023
was the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 2.1 million. 

27 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.8 million, consisting of the net purchases of
short and long-term investments of 14.5 million, and purchases of property and equipment primarily for construction-in-progress of 0.3
million. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.8 million, consisting of the purchase
of property and equipment. 

Financing
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we provided cash from operating activities of 28.4 million, compared to 43.6 million provided
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities
consisted of proceeds from the sale of common stock of 27.7 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock warrants of 0.7 million and
proceeds from our company equity awards programs of 0.05 million. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the issuance of proceeds from
notes payable-shareholders totaling 0.9 million, proceeds from the sale of common stock related to our IPO and private placements totaling
 36.6 million, the exercise of stock options of 1.3 million and the exercise of stock warrants of 2.7 million. 

Net
cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the repayment of notes payable-shareholders
totaling 0.7 million and the payment of deferred offering costs of 0.3 million. 

Equity
Financings 

Common
Stock Issued for Cash Upon Closing of the Company s Second Public Offering 

In
May 2024, we completed an underwritten offering of our common stock, in which we issued and sold 7,500,000 shares of our common stock
at a price of 4.00 per share, which included 625,000 shares of common stock at 4.00 per share pursuant to the underwriters partial
exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. The total gross proceeds received from the offering were 30.0
million and we raised 27.7 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable
by us. 

Included
in the offering were accompanying warrants to purchase 7,500,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of 5.25 per share. The
warrants expire five years from the date of grant. 

Common
Stock Issued for Cash Upon Closing of the Company s Private Placements 

In
May and June 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements (the Purchase Agreements with certain investors pursuant
to which we agreed to sell and issue shares of our common stock in two private placement transactions. Under the Purchase Agreements,
we agreed to extend commitments totaling 24.0 million past their initial due dates. 

Certain
investors who were obligated under the Purchase Agreements to fund remaining committed investment amounts totaling 24.0 million have
not made such payments. The Company is currently evaluating its potential remedies with respect to these investors non-compliance
with their contractual obligations to the Company. 

28 

Funding
Requirements 

We
expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue our research and development,
initiate and conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials, and seek marketing approval for our current and any of our future product
candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our current or our future product candidates, we expect to incur
significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, which costs we may seek to
offset through entry into collaboration agreements with third parties. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with
operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.
If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and
development programs or future commercialization efforts. 

We
believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of filing of this Quarterly Report. We have based this estimate
on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future
capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including: 

the
 costs of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

the
 costs of manufacturing; 

the
 scope, progress, results and costs of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing, and clinical trials for product candidates
 we may develop, if any; 

the
 costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

our
 ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; 

the
 achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any license or collaboration agreements
 we might have at such time; 

the
 costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for
 any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 

the
 amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive
 marketing approval; 

the
 costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights,
 and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

our
 headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our business operations and research and development activities; 

the
costs of operating as a public company; and 

the
 impact of geopolitical and macroeconomic events, including future bank failures, increased geopolitical tensions between the U.S.
 and China, the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the Israel-Hamas war and global pandemics on U.S. and global economic conditions that may
 affect our ability to access capital on acceptable terms, if at all. 

We
anticipate needing to obtain further funding to achieve our business objectives beyond such date. 

Until
such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity
offerings and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements.
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our common stockholders 
ownership interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely
affect the rights of our common stockholders. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive
covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring
dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. 

29 

If
we raise funds through potential collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish
valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that
may not be favorable to us. Our ability to raise additional funds also may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic
conditions and disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from geopolitical
and macroeconomic events such as actual or anticipated changes in interest rates and economic inflation, current and future bank failures,
global pandemics, geopolitical tensions between the United States. and China and the impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the conflicts
in the Middle East. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our
product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise
prefer to develop and market ourselves. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

This
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses
during the reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may differ materially from
our estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances,
facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in our financial statements prospectively from the
date of the change in estimate. 

We
define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about
matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as
the specific manner in which we apply those principles. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2
to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, we believe the following are the critical accounting policies
used in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. 

Prepaid
Research and Development Expenses 

As
part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet
date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that
have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when
we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears
for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our research and development expenses as of each
balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with
the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. 

The
significant estimates in our prepaid research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors
in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced. We base our expenses related to research
and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors
that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract
to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level
of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. 

In
accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each
period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or
prepaid balance accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development
activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. 

30 

Although
we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services
performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or
too low in any particular period. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award on the date
of the grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period
of the respective award. We recognize forfeitures as they occur. The reversal of compensation cost previously recognized for an award
that is forfeited because of a failure to satisfy a service or performance condition is recognized in the period of the forfeiture. Generally,
we issue stock options with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method
over the requisite service period. 

We
classify equity-based compensation expense in our statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient s salary
and related costs are classified or in which the award recipient s service payments are classified. In future periods, we expect
equity-based compensation expense to increase, due in part to our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation expense and as we grant
additional stock-based awards to continue to attract and retain employees. 

Determination
of the Fair Value of Equity-Based Awards 

We
estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value
of our common stock and subjective assumptions we make, including expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the award, the
risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. Due to the lack of sufficient company-specific historical and implied volatility data,
we base the estimate of expected stock price volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of publicly traded companies
for which historical information is available. The historical volatility is generally calculated based on a period of time commensurate
with the expected term assumption. We use the simplified method to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees and directors.
We utilize this method as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the
expected term. For options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term. The risk- free interest rate is based on a U.S.
treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be
zero, as we have never paid dividends and do not have current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock. We determine the fair value
of restricted common stock awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. 

Commitments
and Contingencies 

From
time to time, we may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. We evaluate the likelihood of
an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party and record a loss contingency on an undiscounted basis
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective
and based on the status of such legal proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultation with legal counsel. Actual outcomes of
these legal proceedings may differ materially from our estimates. We estimate accruals for legal expen ses
when incurred as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not have, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements
(as defined under SEC rules).

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

For
a description of recently issued accounting standards that may have a material impact on our financial statements or will otherwise apply
to our operations, please see Note 2 to our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

As
an emerging growth company, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 permits us to take advantage of an extended
transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with
new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such
information is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls
and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any system of
controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

To
our knowledge, we are not currently the subject of any material legal proceeding. In the future, we may be involved in actual and/or
threatened legal proceedings, claims, investigations and government inquiries arising in the ordinary course of our business, including
legal proceedings, claims, investigations and government inquiries involving intellectual property, data privacy and security, other
torts, illegal or objectionable content, consumer protection, securities, employment, contractual rights, civil rights infringement,
false or misleading advertising, or other legal claims relating to our business. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Risk
Factor Summary 

We
face many risks and uncertainties, as more fully described in this section under the heading Risk Factors. Some of these
risks and uncertainties are summarized below. The summary below does not contain all of the information that may be important to you,
and you should read this summary together with the more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties contained in Risk
Factors. Some of the material risks associated with our business include the following: 

We
 have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur significant and increasing losses for the
 foreseeable future and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. 

We
 will require substantial additional financing to advance the development of our product candidates, which may not be available on
 acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product
 development programs, potential commercialization efforts or other operations. 

Our
 product candidates are in preclinical and clinical stages of development, are not approved for commercial sale and might never receive
 regulatory approval or become commercially viable. 

Our
 product candidates are based on a novel approach to the treatment of cancer, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost
 of product candidate development. 

We
 currently have only one product candidate, Olvi-Vec, in clinical development. A failure of this product candidate in clinical development
 would adversely affect our business and may require us to discontinue development of other product candidates based on the same therapeutic
 approach. 

Preclinical
 and clinical development involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome and stringent regulations, and delays
 can occur for a variety of reasons. 

Changes
 in product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay. 

If
 we are unable to manufacture and release any product candidates in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or fail to comply
 with stringent regulations applicable to biopharmaceutical manufacturers, we may face delays in the development and commercialization
 of, or be unable to meet demand for, any product candidates and may lose potential revenues. 

If
 we fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, we could face substantial penalties and
 our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects will be materially harmed. 

We
 are subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations
 related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations
 or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits;
 loss of customers or sales; and other adverse business consequences. 

If
 we are unable to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights for our technology and product candidates, or if our
 intellectual property rights are inadequate, our competitive position could be harmed. 

We
 are highly dependent on our key personnel, including our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. If we are not successful
 in attracting, motivating and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.

Unfavorable
 market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
 stock price and prospects. 

Public
 health crises such as pandemics could materially and adversely affect our preclinical studies and clinical trials, business, financial
 condition and results of operations. 

The
 market price of our common stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond
 our control, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders. 

Risk
Factors 

Investing
in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together
with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report ), including our financial
statements and the related notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, 
before deciding whether to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, our business,
financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the
price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below
are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial
may also adversely affect our business. The risk factors set forth below that are marked with an asterisk ) contain changes to the
similarly titled risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Risks
Related to our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital 

We
have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable
future and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. 

We
are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, and our operations to date have been focused substantially on organizing and staffing
our company, business planning, raising capital, creating, assessing, and developing our technology, establishing our intellectual property
portfolio, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies, commencing clinical trials and manufacturing. Additionally,
as an organization, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory approvals,
manufacture a commercial-scale product, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. We have
never generated any revenue from commercially approved product sales and have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were
20.9 million and 21.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had
an accumulated deficit of 242.4 million. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable
future. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders 
deficit and working capital. 

We
expect that it will be several years, if ever, before we have a commercialized product. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly
from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if, and as, we: 

advance
 the Phase 3 registration clinical trial for our lead product candidate, Olvi-Vec, in platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer
 PRROC 

initiate
 planned and future clinical trials of Olvi-Vec in other cancer indications; 

34 

discover
 and develop new product candidates, and conduct research and development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

manufacture
 preclinical, clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates; 

broaden
 and strengthen our internal manufacturing capabilities, including the expansion and upgrade of our in-house manufacturing facility; 

seek
 regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

maintain,
 expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

hire
 additional research and development, clinical, scientific and management personnel; 

add
 operational, financial and management information systems and personnel; 

establish
 a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain regulatory approval
 and we commercialize on our own or in collaboration with others; and 

incur
 additional legal, accounting and other expenses operating as a public company. 

To
become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue.
This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical studies and clinical trials,
obtaining regulatory approval for product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling products for which we may obtain marketing
approval and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. We are only in the development stages of most of these activities. We may never
succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenue that is significant enough to achieve profitability. Even
if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to
become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business,
maintain our research and development efforts or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause
stockholders to lose all or part of their investment. 

We
will require substantial additional financing to advance the development of Olvi-Vec and any of our future product candidates, which
may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital could force us to delay, limit, reduce
or terminate our product development programs, potential commercialization efforts or other operations. 

The
development of biopharmaceutical product candidates is capital-intensive. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since
inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to continue the preclinical and clinical development of, and seek regulatory
approval for, our current and future product candidates. If we are able to gain marketing approval of any product candidate that we develop,
including Olvi-Vec, we will require significant additional amounts of cash in order to launch and commercialize such product either alone
or in collaboration with others. Because the design and outcome of our ongoing, anticipated and any future clinical trials is highly
uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization
of any product candidate we develop. 

35 

Our
future capital requirements depend on many factors, including: 

the
 scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing Olvi-Vec and our other product candidates and programs, and of conducting
 preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

the
 timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining marketing approvals for Olvi-Vec and future product candidates we develop if clinical
 trials are successful; 

the
 success of any future collaborations; 

the
 cost of commercialization activities for any approved product, including marketing, sales and distribution costs; 

the
 cost and timing of establishing, equipping, and operating our current and planned manufacturing activities; 

the
 cost of manufacturing Olvi-Vec and future product candidates for clinical trials in preparation for marketing approval and commercialization; 

our
 ability to establish and maintain strategic licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; 

the
 cost, timing and outcome of seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA and any other regulatory approvals for
 any future product candidates; 

the
 costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, expanding, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation
 costs and the outcome of such litigation; 

our
 ability to establish and maintain healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement for our future products, if any; 

the
 timing, receipt, and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any; 

the
 emergence of competing cancer therapies and other adverse market developments; 

our
 efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support
 the development of our product candidates; 

the
 costs associated with being a public company; 

our
 need and ability to retain key management and hire scientific, technical, medical and business personnel; 

the
 costs associated with expanding our facilities or building out our laboratory space; and 

the
 impact of geopolitical and macroeconomic events, including future bank failures, increased geopolitical tensions between the United
 States and China, the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the conflicts in the Middle East and global pandemics on U.S. and global economic
 conditions. 

36 

Two
investors from the Private Placements were contractually obligated to fund 30.0 million on or before November 15, 2023,
of which we have received 6.0 million to date. The investors who were obligated to fund the remaining committed investment amounts totaling
 24.0 million have not made such payments. The Company is currently evaluating its potential remedies with respect to these investors 
non-compliance with their contractual obligations to the Company. 

Besides
the Private Placements and the obligations by Newsoara BioPharma Co. Ltd. Newsoara to provide clinical trial funding
under our license agreement with Newsoara (the Newsoara License Agreement ), we do not have any committed external source
of funds or other support for our development efforts. Until we can generate sufficient product revenue to finance our cash requirements,
which we may never do, we expect to finance our future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings and debt
financings, or other capital sources such as potential collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other arrangements.
Based on our research and development plans, we expect that our existing cash balance will enable us to fund our planned operating expenses
and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of filing of this Quarterly Report. We have based
this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
In addition, because the design and outcome of our anticipated and any future clinical trials is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably
estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of Olvi-Vec or any future product
candidates. Our existing cash balance may not be sufficient to complete development of Olvi-Vec or any other product candidate. Additionally,
although we have commitments from investors to fund the remaining aggregate investment amounts in connection with our Private Placements,
we may not receive some or all of the committed proceeds, due to ongoing liquidity constraints or other factors. The failure to receive
all or some of the committed proceeds would exhaust our available capital resources sooner than expected and will require us to obtain
further funding to achieve our business objectives. 

We
have never generated any revenue from commercially approved product sales and may never become profitable. 

Our
ability to generate revenue from product sales and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with future partners, to successfully
complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize, our development programs. We have no products
approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from commercially approved product sales, and do not anticipate generating
any revenue from commercially approved product sales until after we have received marketing approval for the commercial sale of a product
candidate, if ever. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends heavily on our success in achieving a number of
goals, including: 

completing
 research regarding, and preclinical and clinical development of, product candidates and programs, including Olvi-Vec, and identifying
 and developing new product candidates; 

obtaining
 marketing approvals for any product candidates for which we complete clinical trials; 

obtaining
 regulatory approval to use and sell products generated by our existing or future manufacturing processes for Olvi-Vec and future
 product candidates, including at our existing manufacturing facility and/or by establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing
 relationships with third parties; 

launching
 and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain marketing approvals, either directly by establishing a sales force and
 marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure or, alternatively, with a collaborator or distributor; 

establishing
 and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement for our future products, if any; 

37 

obtaining
 market acceptance of product candidates that we develop as viable treatment options; 

addressing
 any competing technological and market developments; 

identifying,
 assessing, acquiring and developing new product candidates; 

negotiating
 favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter and performing our obligations in
 such collaborations; 

maintaining,
 protecting, and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how; and 

attracting,
 hiring, and retaining qualified personnel. 

Even
if Olvi-Vec or any future product candidates that we develop are approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs
associated with commercializing any such product candidate that we commercialize on our own or in collaboration with others. Our expenses
could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to change our manufacturing
processes or assays, or to perform clinical, nonclinical, or other types of studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. 

If
we are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals to market Olvi-Vec or any future product candidates, our revenue will be dependent,
in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain marketing approval, the accepted price for the product, the
ability to get reimbursement at any price, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable
patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indications approved by regulatory authorities are narrower than we expect, the labels
for our product candidates contain significant safety warnings, regulatory authorities impose burdensome or restrictive distribution
requirements, or the reasonably accepted patient populations for treatment are narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment
guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, even if approved. If we are not able to generate revenue
from the sale of any approved products, we could be prevented from or significantly delayed in achieving profitability. 

Raising
additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies
or product candidates. 

To
the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock,
our stockholders ownership interest may be diluted. Any future debt financings we undertake, if available, are likely to involve
restrictive covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital
expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through licensing or collaboration arrangements with third parties,
we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. We also
could be required to seek collaborators for product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or relinquish our
rights to product candidates or technologies that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. 

Failure
to obtain capital when needed on acceptable terms may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development and commercialization
of our current or future product candidates, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations, stock price and prospects. Securing additional financing could also require a substantial amount of time from our management
and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from daily activities, which may adversely affect our management s
ability to oversee the development of Olvi-Vec or any future product candidates. 

38 

The
report of our independent registered public accounting firm included a going concern explanatory paragraph. 

The
report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023
and 2022 included an explanatory paragraph indicating that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be
materially and adversely affected, and we may be forced to delay our development efforts, limit our activities and reduce research and
development costs. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and the values we receive for
our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. The inclusion
of a going concern explanatory paragraph by our independent registered public accounting firm, our lack of cash resources and our potential
inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital, enter
into licensing and collaboration arrangements or other contractual relationships with third parties and otherwise execute our development
strategy. 

Risks
Related to Product Discovery, Development and Regulatory Approval 

Our
development of product candidates based on our technology platform is limited, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop
any products of commercial value. 

The
success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to identify novel product candidates based on our CHOICE platform and to successfully
develop and commercialize those product candidates. While we have had promising preclinical study and clinical trial results for Olvi-Vec,
to date, it remains our only product candidate that has moved into clinical trials. We have not yet succeeded and may not succeed in
demonstrating efficacy and safety in commercializing Olvi-Vec. We also may be unsuccessful in identifying additional product candidates
beyond Olvi-Vec using our CHOICE platform, and any of our product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other
characteristics that may necessitate additional clinical testing, or make the product candidates unmarketable or unlikely to receive
marketing approval. In particular, because all of our product candidates have been derived from our CHOICE platform, the failure of any
one of our development programs could create a perception that our other programs are less likely to succeed or that our discovery platform
is not viable. Similarly, adverse developments with respect to other companies that attempt to use a similar approach to our approach
may adversely impact the actual or perceived value and potential of our discovery platform and resulting product candidates. 

If
any of these events occur, our ability to successfully discover, develop and commercialize any product candidates may be impaired and
the value of our company could decline significantly. 

Our
product candidates are in preclinical and clinical stages of development, are not approved for commercial sale and might never receive
regulatory approval or become commercially viable. 

All
of our product candidates are in research, preclinical or clinical development. We have not completed the development of any product
candidates, we currently generate no revenue, and we may never be able to develop a marketable product. Enrollment of our Phase 2 clinical
trial, an open-label, single-arm study, of our lead product candidate, Olvi-Vec, in patients with PRROC, was completed in September 2019,
and we reported multiple data readouts in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 for our Phase 2 PRROC clinical trial. We expect the final readout,
reported on May 25, 2023 and published in JAMA Oncology in May 2023, to remain essentially unchanged in the final study report. Our Phase
3 registration trial of Olvi-Vec in PRROC initiated enrollment in the third quarter of 2022. We continue to enroll patients in this Phase
3 trial with topline results anticipated in the second half of 2025. 

39 

Newsoara
is generally obligated under the Newsoara License Agreement to fund a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, and controlled clinical trial
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered Olvi-Vec oncolytic vaccinia virus VACV for patients
with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC ), which U.S.-based trial (the VIRO-25 trial is now ongoing
with the first patient dosed in October 2024. In November 2023, we agreed with Newsoara that we would directly engage a contract research
organization CRO on mutually agreeable terms to conduct certain startup activities for the NSCLC trial in the United
States only, with Newsoara reimbursing us for the costs and expenses of such agreed-upon startup activities. Under the agreed upon terms,
Newsoara is permitted to defer such reimbursement payments until the completion of its next round of financing, which Newsoara expects
to occur in late 2024. We expect to report interim results from the NSCLC trial in mid-2025. Subject to regulatory authorization in China,
the Company expects Newsoara eventually to add sites in China and for the parties to conduct this study as a multi-regional clinical
trial. 

We
and Newsoara co-sponsor a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in patients with recurrent SCLC in China, which Newsoara is conducting,
and initiated the Phase 1 portion in the first half of 2023. We expect to report interim results from the SCLC trial by the end
of 2024. In addition to expecting Newsoara to join our ongoing Phase 2 NSCLC trial, as discussed above, we anticipate they will initiate
a trial in recurrent ovarian cancer in China. 

Additionally,
we have a portfolio of oncolytic VACV constructs that are in early-to-mid stages of discovery and preclinical development that may never
advance to clinical-stage development or marketing approval. Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur
for several years, if ever, will depend on obtaining marketing approvals for, and successfully commercializing our product candidates,
either alone or in collaboration with others, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever obtain marketing approval for any of our product
candidates. Before obtaining marketing approval for the commercial distribution of our product candidates, we, or a future collaborator,
must conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our product candidates. 

The
success of our current and future product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following: 

successful
 completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

sufficiency
 of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

acceptance
 of INDs or IND amendments for our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials; 

successful
 enrollment and completion of clinical trials; 

successful
 data from our clinical trials that support FDA conclusion of an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the
 intended populations; 

receipt
 of regulatory and marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

40 

obtaining
 and maintaining patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; 

obtaining
 regulatory approval to use our existing or future manufacturing processes for the clinical and commercial manufacture of our product
 candidates at our existing or future manufacturing facilities or at the facilities of one or more third-party manufacturers with
 whom we would need to establish supply arrangements; 

successfully
 launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 

acceptance
 of any products we develop and their benefits and uses, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party
 payors; 

effectively
 competing with other therapies; 

obtaining
 and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; and 

maintaining
 a continued acceptable safety profile of the products following approval. 

If
we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to
successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business. 

We
currently have only one product candidate, Olvi-Vec, in clinical development. A failure of this product candidate in clinical development
would adversely affect our business and may require us to discontinue development of other product candidates based on the same therapeutic
approach. 

We
have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in our oncolytic VACV platform and, in particular, in the
development of our lead product candidate, Olvi-Vec. We have completed enrollment for only one Phase 2 clinical trial, an open-label
single-arm study, of Olvi-Vec in patients with PRROC in September 2019. Our Phase 3 registration trial of Olvi-Vec in PRROC
initiated enrollment in the third quarter of 2022. Our co-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial in SCLC continues to enroll patients in
China. In October 2024, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in our ongoing Phase 2, open-label, randomized, and
controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered Olvi-Vec oncolytic VACV for
patients with recurrent NSCLC which is expected to report interim results in mid-2025. Olvi-Vec, as well as our other product
candidates, are susceptible to the risks of failure inherent at any stage of product development, including the occurrence of
unexpected or unacceptable adverse events or the failure to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials. We will need to successfully
complete such trials before submitting a marketing application to the FDA. 

We
have submitted an IND application with respect to only one product candidate, Olvi-Vec. V2ACT LLC, a joint venture between TVAX Biomedical,
Inc. TVAX and us, has also filed its own IND for V2ACT Immunotherapy, a combination of Olvi-Vec and vaccine-enhanced
adoptive cell therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed, surgically-resectable pancreatic cancer patients. For V2ACT Immunotherapy,
no clinical trial is yet scheduled to be initiated. We have not previously submitted a biologics license application BLA to the FDA, or similar regulatory approval filings to comparable foreign authorities, for any product candidate, and we cannot be certain
that our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, our product candidates may
not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. 

41 

Since
Olvi-Vec is based on our oncolytic VACV platform, if Olvi-Vec fails in development as a result of any underlying problem with our oncolytic
VACV platform, then we may be required to discontinue development of all product candidates that are based on this therapeutic approach.
If we were required to discontinue development of Olvi-Vec or our other future product candidates, or if any of them were to fail to
receive regulatory approval or achieve sufficient market acceptance, we could be prevented from or significantly delayed in achieving
profitability. We can provide no assurance that we would be successful at developing other product candidates based on an alternative
therapeutic approach. 

Our
product candidates are based on a novel approach to the treatment of cancer, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of
product candidate development. 

We
have concentrated all of our research and development efforts on product candidates based on our oncolytic VACV platform, which is novel.
We only have conducted clinical development of Olvi-Vec in human cancer patients. Our future success depends on the successful development
of our oncolytic VACV platform. Any development problems we experience in the future may cause significant delays or unanticipated costs,
and we may not be able to solve any such development problems. Should we encounter development problems, including unfavorable preclinical
study or clinical trial results, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may place all, or part, of our clinical development on hold
or refuse to approve our product candidates, or may require additional information, tests, or trials, which could significantly delay
product development and significantly increase our development costs. Moreover, even if we are able to provide the requested information
or trials to the FDA, there would be no guarantee that the FDA would accept them or approve our product candidates. We may also experience
delays in developing and obtaining regulatory approval for a sustainable, reproducible and scalable manufacturing process, or developing
or qualifying and validating product release assays, other testing and manufacturing methods, and our equipment and facilities in a timely
manner, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our product candidates on a timely or profitable
basis, if at all. 

In
addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators
use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended
use and market of the potential products. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities have limited experience with the approval
of viral immunotherapies. To date, there is only one FDA-approved viral immunotherapy-talimogene laherparepvec IMLYGIC ).
Any viral immunotherapies that are approved may be subject to extensive post-approval regulatory requirements, including post-approval
studies as well as requirements pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and promotion. We may need to devote significant time and resources
to compliance with these requirements. 

Preclinical
and clinical development involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome and stringent regulations, and delays can
occur for a variety of reasons. 

In
order to obtain FDA approval to market a new biological product, we must demonstrate proof of safety as well as purity and potency (i.e.,
efficacy) in humans. To meet these requirements, we will have to conduct adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Before we can
commence clinical trials for a product candidate, we must complete extensive preclinical testing and studies that support our planned
INDs in the United States. We only have one product candidate currently being evaluated in human clinical development, Olvi-Vec. In addition,
the FDA has granted permission to proceed with a clinical trial under the IND for V2ACT Immunotherapy, but no clinical trial has been
initiated or is currently scheduled to initiate. The rest of our product candidates are in preclinical development, have not yet been
evaluated in IND-enabling studies and their risk of failure is high. We cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of our
preclinical testing and studies or clinical trials and cannot predict if the FDA will accept our proposed clinical programs or if the
outcome of our preclinical testing and studies or clinical trials will ultimately support the further development of our programs. As
a result, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit INDs or similar applications for our preclinical programs on the timelines
we expect, if at all. Additionally, we cannot be sure that submission of INDs or similar applications will result in the FDA or other
regulatory authorities allowing clinical trials to begin, and we cannot be sure that our planned clinical trials will begin on time or
that our ongoing clinical trials will be completed on schedule. 

42 

Conducting
preclinical testing and clinical development is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. The length of time may vary substantially
according to the type, complexity and novelty of the program, and often can be several years or more per program. Delays associated with
programs for which we are directly conducting preclinical testing and studies may cause us to incur additional operating expenses. Moreover,
we may be affected by delays associated with the preclinical testing and studies of certain programs that are the responsibility of any
potential future partners over which we have no control. The commencement and rate of completion of preclinical studies and clinical
trials for a product candidate may be delayed by many factors, including, for example: 

inability
 to generate sufficient preclinical or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation of clinical trials; 

unexpected
 toxicities observed in preclinical IND-enabling studies precluding the identification of a safe dose to move forward in human clinical
 trials; 

delays
 in obtaining regulatory approval for, and production or manufacturing of, clinical supply; 

delays
 in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study or trial design; and 

regulatory
 authorities not allowing us to rely on previous findings of safety and efficacy for other similar but approved products and published
 scientific literature. 

We
may experience delays in initiating or completing clinical trials. We also may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a
result of, any ongoing or future clinical trials that we could conduct that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval
or commercialize Olvi-Vec or any future product candidates, including: 

delays
 or failures, which may result in clinical site closures, delays to patient enrollment, patients withdrawing prior to receiving treatment
 (e.g., catheter implantation failure), patients discontinuing their treatment or follow-up visits or changes to trial protocols; 

regulators
 or institutional review boards IRBs ), may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial, conduct
 a clinical trial at a prospective trial site, or amend trial protocols, or may require that we modify or amend our clinical trial
 protocols; 

we
 may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols
 with prospective trial sites and/or CROs; 

clinical
 trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, or our studies may fail to reach the necessary level
 of statistical significance, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product
 development programs; 

the
 unsuccessful implantation of catheters used to deliver Olvi-Vec; 

43 

the
 number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical
 trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or be lost to follow-up at a higher
 rate than we anticipate, or may elect to participate in alternative clinical trials sponsored by our competitors with product candidates
 that treat the same indications as our product candidates; 

third-party
 contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or the clinical trial protocol, or meet their contractual obligations
 to us in a timely manner, or at all, or we may be required to engage in additional clinical trial site monitoring; 

manufacturing
 delays; 

we,
 regulators, or IRBs may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including
 noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable
 side effects, emergent drug-drug interactions between Olvi-Vec and any of the other therapeutic agents given to the clinical trial
 subjects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate, or due to findings of undesirable effects caused by a biologically,
 chemically or mechanistically similar therapeutic or therapeutic candidate, or flaws in the design of the trial; 

changes
 could be adopted in marketing approval policies during the development period, rendering our data insufficient to obtain marketing
 approval; 

statutes
 or regulations could be amended, or new ones could be adopted; 

changes
 could be adopted in the regulatory review process for submitted product applications; 

the
 cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate, or we may have insufficient funds for a clinical
 trial or product manufacture or to pay the substantial user fees required by the FDA upon the submission of a BLA or equivalent authorizations
 from comparable foreign regulatory authorities; 

the
 supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may
 be insufficient or inadequate; 

the
 FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the existing or future manufacturing processes or facilities
 of our company or of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; 

we
 may decide, or regulatory authorities may require us, to conduct or gather, as applicable, additional clinical trials, analyses,
 reports, data, or preclinical studies, or we may abandon product development programs; 

we
 may fail to reach an agreement with regulatory authorities or IRBs regarding the scope, design, or implementation of our clinical
 trials, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require changes to our study designs that make further study
 impractical or not financially prudent; 

Regulatory
 authorities may ultimately disagree with the design or our conduct of our preclinical studies or clinical trials, finding that they
 do not support product candidate approval; 

44 

we
 may have delays in adding new investigators or clinical trial sites, or we may experience a withdrawal of clinical trial sites; 

patients
 that enroll in our studies may misrepresent their eligibility or may otherwise not comply with the clinical trial protocol, resulting
 in the need to drop the patients from the study or clinical trial, increase the needed enrollment size for the clinical trial or
 extend its duration; 

there
 may be regulatory questions or disagreements regarding interpretations of data and results, or new information may emerge regarding
 our product candidates; 

the
 FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our trial design, including endpoints, or our interpretation of
 data from preclinical studies and clinical trials or find that a product candidate s benefits do not outweigh its safety risks; 

the
 FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from studies with clinical trial sites in foreign countries; 

the
 FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our intended indications; 

the
 FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes
 or our manufacturing facilities for clinical and future commercial supplies; 

the
 data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable
 foreign regulatory authorities to support the submission of a BLA or other comparable submission in foreign jurisdictions or to obtain
 regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere; 

the
 FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may take longer than we anticipate to make a decision on our product candidates;
 and 

we
 may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate provides an advantage over current standards of care or current or future
 competitive therapies in development, including, for example, due to a longer-and/or-higher-than-expected response rate determination
 in the active comparator group or a shorter-and/or-lower-than-expected response rate determination in the experimental drug group. 

For
example, we previously modified our manufacturing process and had to demonstrate analytical comparability to the FDA in order to use
Olvi-Vec manufactured by this process in our ongoing Phase 3 PRROC trial. Any future changes to our manufacturing process may similarly
require comparability assessments by the FDA and could delay clinical trials or, if the modified manufacturing process is not comparable,
result in inconsistencies in trial results that may be difficult to explain. 

Our
Phase 3 registration trial of Olvi-Vec in PRROC initiated enrollment in the third quarter of 2022. The FDA may issue further comments
to our Phase 3 clinical trial protocol and may conclude Olvi-Vec produced in mammalian cells is not comparable to material produced in
chick embryo fibroblast CEF cells, and/or place our IND on clinical hold. Placing our IND on clinical hold may cause
delays in the initiation of our Phase 3 registration clinical trial. Any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain authorization from the
FDA to conduct our Phase 3 clinical trial could materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from Olvi-Vec, which may
materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

45 

Our
product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in clinical testing or marketing approvals, and we may not have
sufficient funding to complete the testing and approval process for any of our current or future product candidates. We may be required
to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials and prepare for possible commercialization of our product candidates. We do not
know whether any preclinical studies or clinical trials beyond what we currently have planned will be required, will begin as planned,
will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule or at all. Significant delays relating to any preclinical studies or clinical
trials also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our
competitors to bring products to market before we do, which would impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates
and may harm our business and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, delays in clinical trials
may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of any of our product candidates. Any delays in our clinical development programs
may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations significantly. 

If
we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals
could be delayed or prevented. 

We
may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient
number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. 

Patient
enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient
population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, the design of the clinical
trial, competing clinical trials, and clinicians and patients perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product
candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we
are investigating. 

The
timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient
number of patients who remain in the study until its conclusion. We may experience difficulties in patient enrollment or retention in
our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including: 

availability
 and efficacy of approved therapies for the disease under investigation; 

patient
 eligibility criteria for the trial in question; 

risks
 that enrolled subjects will drop out before completion of the trial, including as a result of emergent drug-drug interactions between
 Olvi-Vec and any of the other therapeutic agents given to the clinical trial subjects or contracting health conditions; 

46 

risks
 of excessive catheter implantation failures leading to elimination of particular study sites from the trial in question; 

perceived
 risks and benefits of the product candidate under study; 

the
 timely initiation of clinical trial sites; 

efforts
 to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; 

patient
 referral practices of physicians; 

the
 ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; 

proximity
 and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; 

withdrawal
 of consent for any reason; 

imbalance
 in withdrawals between the comparator and treatment arms; 

unforeseen
 limitations of protocol design; and 

protocol
 amendment by the sponsor and/or as requested by applicable regulatory authorities. 

In
addition, our planned clinical trials may compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic
areas as our product candidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us because some patients
who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a competing clinical trial. 

Our
inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our anticipated and any future clinical trials would result in significant delays
or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased
development costs for our product candidates, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
and prospects. 

Results
of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results of future clinical trials. 

For
our lead product candidate, Olvi-Vec, we completed enrollment, and we reported multiple data readouts in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 for
our Phase 2 PRROC clinical trial. We expect the final readout, reported on May 25, 2023 and published in JAMA Oncology in May 2023, to
remain essentially unchanged in the final study report. Our Phase 3 registration trial of Olvi-Vec in PRROC initiated enrollment in the
third quarter of 2022. Upon completion of this Phase 3 trial, and provided the data demonstrate patient benefit in the PRROC patient
population with an acceptable safety profile, we plan to ask for a pre-BLA meeting with the FDA and seek guidance on submission of a
marketing application based on the accelerated approval regulations. We anticipate a post-marketing study will be required to confirm
a survival benefit. Clinical development is expensive and can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Olvi-Vec
may not perform as we expect in clinical trials, particularly in our open-label, randomized, and controlled Phase 3 registration clinical
trial, in which Olvi-Vec may ultimately have a different or no impact on tumors, may have a different mechanism of action than we expect
and may not ultimately prove to be safe and effective. The FDA s analysis and interpretation of the data may also differ from ours. 

47 

The
results of previous clinical trials of Olvi-Vec and results of preclinical studies or early clinical trials of any other product candidate
we develop, may not be predictive of the results of subsequent and later-stage clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical
and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in registration-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results
in earlier development, and we could face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support
approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced.
We do not have experience in successfully completing a registration-stage clinical trial and may be unable to execute a clinical trial
to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses.
Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless
failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if we, or future collaborators, believe that the results of clinical
trials for our product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may
not grant marketing approval of our product candidates. 

In
some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product
candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of
the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the clinical trial protocols, variations in conducting clinical trials at different
sites, changes in medical practice, FDA requirements based on agency guidelines or precedence which may be more strict for a Phase 3
clinical trial, the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants and changes in the manufacturing process. Moreover, should there
be an issue with the design of any of our clinical trials, our results may be impacted. We may not discover such a flaw until the clinical
trial is at an advanced stage. 

Interim,
topline, and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data
become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. 

From
time to time, we may publicly disclose interim, topline, or preliminary data from our clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary
analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive
review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations, and conclusions as
part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result,
the interim, topline, or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions
or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Interim, topline, and preliminary
data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary
data we previously published. As a result, such data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. From time to time,
we may also disclose interim data from our clinical trials. Interim, topline, and preliminary data from clinical trials that we may complete
are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient
data become available. Adverse differences between preliminary, interim or topline data and final data could significantly harm our business
prospects. 

48 

Further,
others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions, or analyses
or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability,
or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose
to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others
may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information
we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or
otherwise regarding a particular product, product candidate, or our business. If the interim, topline, or preliminary data that we report
differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain
approval for, and commercialize Olvi-Vec and any future product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results,
prospects, or financial condition. 

Fast
track designation by the FDA for Olvi-Vec may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not
increase the likelihood that Olvi-Vec or any future product candidate which may receive fast track designation will receive marketing
approval. 

The
FDA has granted a fast track designation for Olvi-Vec for the treatment of patients with PRROC, and we may seek fast track designations
for other indications or future product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing
new product candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended,
alone or in combination with one or more drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate
the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product
candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities
for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the application
may be eligible for priority review. A BLA submitted for a fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where
the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides
a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule
is acceptable, and the Sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 

The
FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation. Even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for
this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it. Although we have received fast track designation for Olvi-Vec
for the treatment of patients with PRROC, and even if we receive additional fast track designations for other indications or any future
product candidates, such product candidates may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional
FDA procedures. The FDA may also withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from
our clinical development program. Furthermore, such a designation does not increase the likelihood that Olvi-Vec or any future product
candidate that may be granted fast track designation will receive marketing approval in the United States. Many product candidates that
have received fast track designation have ultimately failed to obtain approval. 

We
may attempt to secure approval from the FDA through the use of the accelerated approval pathway. If we are unable to obtain such approval,
we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials beyond those that we contemplate, which could increase the expense of obtaining,
and delay the receipt of, necessary regulatory approvals. Even if we receive accelerated approval from the FDA, if our confirmatory trials
do not verify clinical benefit, or if we do not comply with rigorous post-marketing requirements, the FDA may seek to withdraw any accelerated
approval we have obtained. 

49 

We
may in the future seek an accelerated approval for Olvi-Vec or our future product candidates. Under the accelerated approval program,
the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product candidate designed to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that provides
meaningful therapeutic benefit over available therapies upon a determination that such product candidate has an effect on a surrogate
endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA considers a clinical benefit
to be a positive therapeutic effect that is clinically meaningful in the context of a given disease, such as irreversible morbidity or
mortality. For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic
image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. An
intermediate clinical endpoint is a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality
that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. 

The
accelerated approval pathway may be used in cases in which the advantage of a new drug over available therapy may not be a direct therapeutic
advantage, but is a clinically important improvement from a patient and public health perspective. If granted, accelerated approval is
usually contingent on the sponsor s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to
verify and describe the drug s clinical benefit. If such confirmatory studies fail to confirm the drug s clinical benefit
or are not completed in a timely manner, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug on an expedited basis. In addition, in December
2022, the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 was enacted, which, among other things, provided the FDA new statutory authority to
mitigate potential risks to patients from continued marketing of ineffective drugs previously granted accelerated approval, and additional
oversight over confirmatory trials. Under these provisions, the FDA may, among other things, require a sponsor of a product seeking accelerated
approval to have a confirmatory trial underway prior to such approval being granted. 

Prior
to seeking approval for Olvi-Vec or any future product candidate we intend to seek feedback from the FDA and will otherwise evaluate
our ability to seek and receive accelerated approval. There can be no assurance that after our evaluation of the feedback and other factors
we will decide to pursue or submit a BLA for accelerated approval or obtain any other form of expedited development, review, or approval.
Furthermore, if we decide to submit an application for accelerated approval for Olvi-Vec or any future product candidate, there can be
no assurance that such submission or application will be accepted or that any expedited development, review, or approval will be granted
on a timely basis, or at all. The FDA could also require us to conduct further studies prior to considering our application or granting
approval of any type. A failure to obtain accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review, or approval for Olvi-Vec
or any future product candidate would result in a longer time period to commercialization of such product candidate, if any, could increase
the cost of development of such product candidate, and could harm our competitive position in the marketplace. 

50 

Serious
adverse events, undesirable side effects (including emergent drug-drug interactions between Olvi-Vec and any of the other therapeutic
agents given to the clinical trial subjects) or other unexpected properties of our current or future product candidates may be identified
during development or after approval, which could halt their development or lead to the discontinuation of our clinical development programs,
refusal by regulatory authorities to approve our product candidates or, if discovered following marketing approval, revocation of marketing
authorizations or limitations on the use of our product candidates thereby limiting the commercial potential of such product candidate. 

To
date, Olvi-Vec is the only product candidate we have tested in humans. The most advanced trial with enrollment completed was our
open-label, single-arm Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in PRROC. Enrollment was completed in September 2019, and we reported multiple data
readouts in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 for our Phase 2 PRROC clinical trial. We expect the final readout, reported on May 25, 2023
and published in JAMA Oncology in May 2023, to remain essentially unchanged in the final study report. Additionally, we previously
conducted five Phase 1 clinical trials and one Expanded Access Program in different indications, using different routes of
administration and different dosing regimens. The most common treatment-related toxicities generally observed in our trials from
different routes of administration were pyrexia, nausea, chills and fatigue with additional common treatment-related toxicities
observed in our intraperitoneal administration trials being abdominal pain and abdominal distension. As we continue our development
of Olvi-Vec and initiate clinical trials of any future product candidates, serious adverse events, undesirable side effects or
unexpected characteristics may emerge or be reported, causing us to abandon these product candidates or limit their development to
more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the serious adverse events, undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less
prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Even if our product candidates initially show promise in
early clinical trials, the side effects of therapies are frequently only detectable after the drug is tested in large, Phase 3
clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients on a commercial scale after approval. Sometimes, it can
be difficult to determine if the serious adverse or unexpected side effects were caused by the product candidate or another factor,
especially in oncology subjects who may suffer from other medical conditions and be taking other medications. For instance, during
our ongoing clinical trials, we may discover serious adverse or unexpected side effects of Olvi-Vec produced in mammalian cells that
are not comparable to material produced in CEF cells. If serious adverse or unexpected side effects are identified
during development and are determined to be attributed to our product candidates, or the result of drug-drug interactions between
our product candidate and any of the concomitant therapies given to the trial subjects, we, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory
authorities, or IRBs and other reviewing entities, could interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials and could result in a more
restrictive label, a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy REMS or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by
the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may also require, or we
may voluntarily develop strategies for managing adverse events during clinical development, which could include restrictions on our
enrollment criteria, the use of stopping criteria, adjustments to a study s design, or the monitoring of safety data by a data
monitoring committee, among other strategies. Any requests from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority for additional
data or information could also result in substantial delays in the approval of our product candidates. 

Drug-related
side effects could also affect subject recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial or result in potential product
liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. 

In
addition, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects
caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including: 

regulatory
 authorities may withdraw approvals of such product; 

regulatory
 authorities may require additional warnings on the label; 

we
 may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients; 

we
 may be forced to suspend marketing of that product, or decide to remove the product from the marketplace; 

we
 may be required to change the way the product is administered; 

we
 could be subject to fines, injunctions, or the imposition of criminal or civil penalties; 

we
 could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and 

the
 product may become less competitive, and our reputation may suffer. 

51 

The
therapeutic-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result
in potential product liability claims. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular
product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and
prospects. 

We
anticipate that many of our product candidates will be used in combination with third-party drugs and/or devices, some of which may still
be in development, and we have limited or no control over the supply, regulatory status or regulatory approval of such drugs and/or devices. 

We
anticipate developing our product candidates for use in combination with other oncology therapeutics, including chemotherapies and cellular
and targeted therapies (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors), or medical devices (e.g. intraperitoneal catheter). For example, in our
Phase 3 registration clinical trial, we are developing the intraperitoneal (catheter) delivery of Olvi-Vec in combination with a platinum-based
chemotherapy doublet and bevacizumab (e.g., AVASTIN). Further, in our Phase 2 clinical trial, we are developing the intravenous
delivery of Olvi-Vec in combination with a platinum-based chemotherapy doublet and physician s choice of immune checkpoint inhibitors
(e.g. KEYTRUDA, OPDIVO, YERVOY or TECENTRIQ). Our ability to develop and ultimately commercialize our product candidates used
in combination with platinum-based and other chemotherapies, and bevacizumab, or any other combination products (e.g., cellular and targeted
therapies), and used with devices (e.g., catheters) will depend on our ability to access such drugs and devices on commercially reasonable
terms for the clinical trials and their availability for use with the commercialized product, if approved. We cannot be certain that
current or potential future commercial relationships will provide us with a steady supply of such drugs or devices on commercially reasonable
terms or at all. 

Any
failure to maintain or enter into new successful commercial relationships, or the expense of purchasing platinum-based and other chemotherapies,
and bevacizumab, or any other combination products, or any devices in the market, may delay our development timelines, increase our costs
and jeopardize our ability to develop our product candidates as commercially-viable therapies. If any of these occur, our business, financial
condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects may be materially harmed. 

Moreover,
the development of product candidates for use in combination with another product or product candidate may present challenges that are
not faced for single agent product candidates. For our product candidates that may be used in combination with platinum-based and other
chemotherapies, and bevacizumab, or any other combination products or any devices, the FDA may require us to use more complex clinical
trial designs in order to evaluate the contribution of each product and product candidate to any observed effects. It is possible that
the results of these trials could show that there are adverse events tied to the interaction of Olvi-Vec with any of the other therapies,
or that any positive previous trial results are attributable to the combination therapy and not our product candidates. Moreover, following
product approval, the FDA may require that products or devices used in conjunction with each other be cross labeled for combined use.
To the extent that we do not have rights to the other product or device, this may require us to work with a third party to satisfy such
a requirement. The ability to obtain cooperation from the third party may impact our ability to respond to the FDA s requests which
could impact our ability to achieve regulatory approval. Moreover, developments related to the other product or device may impact our
clinical trials as well as our commercial prospects should we receive marketing approval. Such developments may include changes to the
safety or efficacy profile of the other product or device, changes to the availability of the approved product or device, and changes
to the standard of care. 

In
the event that any future collaborator or supplier of platinum-based and other chemotherapies, and bevacizumab, or any other products
administered in combination, or any devices used, with our product candidates does not supply their products on commercially reasonable
terms or in a timely fashion, we would need to identify alternatives for accessing these products. This could cause our clinical trials
to be delayed and limit the commercial opportunities for our product candidates, in which case our business, financial condition, results
of operations, stock price and prospects may be materially harmed. 

52 

We
may not be successful in our efforts to expand our pipeline of product candidates and develop marketable products. 

We
expect initially to develop our lead product candidate, Olvi-Vec. We anticipate pursuing clinical development of other product candidates,
alone or in collaboration with our partners. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial
and human resources. Developing, obtaining marketing approval for, and commercializing additional product candidates will require substantial
additional funding and will be subject to the risks of failure inherent in medical product development. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to successfully advance any of these additional product candidates through the development process. 

Even
if we obtain approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to market additional product candidates for the treatment
of cancer, we cannot assure you that any such product candidates will be successfully commercialized, widely accepted in the marketplace,
or more effective than other commercially available alternatives. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize additional
product candidates, our commercial opportunity may be limited and our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price
and prospects may be materially harmed. 

We
may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates
or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. 

Because
we have limited financial and managerial resources, we must prioritize our research programs and will need to focus our product candidates
on the potential treatment of certain indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates
or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail
to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development
programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially-viable products. 

Additionally,
we may pursue additional in-licenses or acquisitions of development-stage assets or programs, which entails additional risk to us. Identifying,
selecting and acquiring promising product candidates requires substantial technical, financial, and human resources expertise. Efforts
to do so may not result in the actual acquisition or license of a particular product candidate, potentially resulting in a diversion
of our management s time and the expenditure of our resources with no resulting benefit. For example, if we are unable to identify
programs that ultimately result in approved products, we may spend material amounts of our capital and other resources evaluating, acquiring
and developing products that ultimately do not provide a return on our investment. 

If
we do not achieve our product development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of our product candidates
may be delayed and as a result our share price may decline. 

Drug
development is inherently risky and uncertain. We cannot be certain that we will be able to: 

complete
 IND-enabling preclinical studies or develop manufacturing processes and associated analytical methods that meet current good manufacturing
 practice cGMP requirements in time to initiate or to complete our anticipated or future clinical trials in the timeframes
 we announce; 

obtain
 sufficient clinical supply of our product candidates to support our anticipated or future clinical trials; 

53 

initiate
 clinical trials within the timeframes we announce; 

enroll
 and maintain a sufficient number of subjects to complete or timely complete any clinical trials; or 

collect
 and analyze the data from any completed clinical trials in the timeframes we announce. 

The
actual timing of our development milestones could vary significantly compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our
control. If we are unable to achieve our goals within the timeframes we announce, the commercialization of our product candidates may
be delayed and, as a result, the stock price of our common stock could fall and you may lose all of your investment. 

Even
if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time-consuming and
uncertain and may prevent us or any of our existing or potential future collaboration partners from obtaining approvals for the commercialization
of Olvi-Vec, V2ACT Immunotherapy and any other product candidate we develop. 

Any
current or future product candidate we may develop, and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including
their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution,
are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and by comparable authorities
in other countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate
in a given jurisdiction. We have not received approval to market any product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction
and it is possible that none of the product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. 

Securing
marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities
for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate s safety and efficacy for that indication. Securing marketing
approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities
and clinical trial sites by, the regulatory authorities. If we do not receive approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory
authorities for any of our product candidates, we will not be able to commercialize such product candidates in the United States or in
other jurisdictions. If significant delays in obtaining approval for and commercializing our product candidates occur in any jurisdictions,
our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects will be materially harmed. Even if our product candidates
are approved, they may: 

be
 subject to limitations on the indicated uses or patient populations for which they may be marketed, distribution restrictions, or
 other conditions of approval; 

contain
 significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings; 

contain
 significant contraindications, and precautions which could reduce the size of the patient population; 

not
 be approved with label statements necessary or desirable for successful commercialization; 

contain
 requirements for costly post-market testing and surveillance, or other requirements, including the submission of a REMS to monitor
 the safety or efficacy of the products; or 

be
 withdrawn from the market because a serious safety issue becomes known after approval is granted. 

54 

The
process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive, takes many years even if successful, and
can vary substantially in and among jurisdictions based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity, and novelty of the
product candidates involved. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for regulatory approval
also varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address, and the regulations
applicable to any particular product candidate. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the
enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays
in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in
the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional
preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing
could delay, limit, or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. It is possible that our product candidates will never obtain
the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us to commence product sales, or any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be
limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. 

If
we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of any current or future product candidates we may develop,
the commercial prospects for those product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired. 

We
are currently conducting our Phase 2 clinical trial for Olvi-Vec in recurrent NSCLC in the United States and plan to conduct this trial
in China as part of a multi-regional clinical trial with our collaboration partner, Newsoara. We may conduct additional clinical trials
in China. However, the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from such trial, in which case our
development plans will be delayed, which could materially harm our business. 

Newsoara
is generally obligated under the Newsoara License Agreement to fund a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, and controlled clinical trial
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered Olvi-Vec oncolytic VACV for patients with recurrent NSCLC in
the United States, which VIRO-25 trial is now ongoing with the first patient dosed in October 2024. In November 2023, we agreed with
Newsoara that we would directly engage a CRO on mutually agreeable terms to conduct certain startup activities for the NSCLC trial in
the United States only, with Newsoara reimbursing us for the costs and expenses of such agreed-upon startup activities. Newsoara is permitted
to defer such reimbursement payments until the completion of its next round of financing, which Newsoara expects to occur in late 2024. 

As
mentioned above, we dosed our first patient in the United States in October 2024 and, subject to regulatory authorization, intend to
launch the NSCLC trial in China with Newsoara. Newsoara initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in patients with recurrent SCLC
in China in the first half of 2023, and we anticipate they will initiate further trials in recurrent NSCLC and recurrent ovarian cancer
in China. 

The
acceptance of study data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States or another jurisdiction by the FDA or comparable foreign
regulatory authority may be subject to certain conditions or may not be accepted at all. In addition, even where the foreign study data
are not intended to serve as the sole basis for approval, the FDA will not accept the data as support for an application for marketing
approval unless the study is well-designed and well-conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization ICH ),
and Good Clinical Practice GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite
inspection if deemed necessary. Many foreign regulatory authorities have similar approval requirements. In addition, such foreign trials
would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the trials are conducted. There can be no assurance
that the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of the applicable jurisdiction.
If the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would result in the need for additional trials,
which could be costly and time-consuming, and which may result in current or future product candidates that we may develop not receiving
approval for commercialization in the applicable jurisdiction. 

55 

We
believe that clinical data generated in China and the United States will be accepted by the FDA and its comparable foreign regulatory
equivalents outside of China, which would enable us to commence Phase 3 and possibly registration clinical trials in the United States
without the need for us to conduct additional Phase 2 clinical trials in the United States. However, there can be no assurance the FDA
or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will accept data from our Phase 2 clinical trial in Olvi-Vec, which is currently ongoing
in the United States. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities do not accept any such data, we would likely be required
to conduct additional Phase 2 clinical trials, which would be costly and time consuming, and delay aspects of our development plan, which
could harm our business. 

Conducting
clinical trials outside the United States exposes us to additional risks, including risks associated with: 

additional
 foreign regulatory requirements; 

compliance
 with foreign manufacturing, customs, shipment and storage requirements; 

cultural
 differences in medical practice and clinical research; and 

diminished
 protection of intellectual property in some countries. 

Approval
by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to market a product candidate will be limited to those specific indications and
conditions for which approval has been granted, and we may be subject to substantial fines, criminal penalties, injunctions, or other
enforcement actions if we are determined to be promoting the use of any products for unapproved or off-label uses, resulting
in damage to our reputation and business. 

We
must comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
Promotional communications with respect to therapeutics are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and continuing
review by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General,
state attorneys general, members of Congress, and the public. When the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities issue regulatory
approval to market a product candidate, the regulatory approval is limited to those specific uses and indications for which a product
is approved. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for desired uses or indications for our product candidates, we may not market
or promote them for those indications and uses, referred to as off-label uses, and our business, financial condition, results of operations,
stock price and prospects will be materially harmed. We also must sufficiently substantiate any claims that we make for any products
we develop, including claims comparing our products to other companies products, and must abide by the FDA s strict requirements
regarding the content of promotion and advertising. 

56 

Because
regulatory authorities in the United States generally do not restrict or regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatment
within the practice of medicine, physicians may in their independent medical judgment choose to prescribe products for uses that are
not described in the product s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical trials and approved by the regulatory
authorities. Regulatory authorities do, however, limit communications by biopharmaceutical companies concerning off-label use. Therefore,
we are prohibited from marketing and promoting the products for indications and uses that are not specifically approved by the FDA. 

If
we are found to have impermissibly promoted any products that we may develop, we may become subject to significant liability and government
fines. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations regarding product promotion, particularly those prohibiting
the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted a product may be subject to significant sanctions.
The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several
companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions
under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 

In
the United States, the promotion of biopharmaceutical products is subject to additional FDA requirements and restrictions on promotional
statements. If after one or more of our product candidates obtains marketing approval, the FDA determines that our promotional activities
violate its regulations and policies pertaining to product promotion, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or subject
us to regulatory or other enforcement actions, including issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, suspension or withdrawal of
an approved product from the market, requests for recalls, payment of civil fines, disgorgement of money, imposition of operating restrictions,
injunctions or criminal prosecution, and other enforcement actions. Similarly, industry codes in foreign jurisdictions may prohibit companies
from engaging in certain promotional activities and regulatory agencies in various countries may enforce violations of such codes with
civil penalties. If we become subject to regulatory and enforcement actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations,
stock price and prospects will be materially harmed. 

Engaging
in the impermissible promotion of our products, in the United States, following approval, for off-label uses can also subject us to false
claims and other litigation under federal and state statutes. These include fraud and abuse and consumer protection laws, which can lead
to civil and criminal penalties and fines, agreements with governmental authorities that materially restrict the manner in which we promote
or distribute therapeutic products and conduct our business. These restrictions could include corporate integrity agreements, suspension
or exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and suspension and debarment from government contracts and
refusal of orders under existing government contracts. These False Claims Act (FCA) lawsuits against manufacturers of drugs and biological
products have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements, up to 3.0
billion, pertaining to certain sales practices and promoting off-label uses. In addition, FCA lawsuits may expose manufacturers to follow-on
claims by private payors based on fraudulent marketing practices. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a biopharmaceutical
company will have to defend a false claim action, pay settlement fines or restitution, as well as criminal and civil penalties, agree
to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal and state healthcare
programs. If we do not lawfully promote our approved products, if any, we may become subject to such litigation and, if we do not successfully
defend against such actions, those actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
stock price and prospects. 

57 

Obtaining
and maintaining marketing approval for our product candidates in one jurisdiction would not mean that we will be successful in obtaining
marketing approval of that product candidate in other jurisdictions, which could prevent us from marketing our products internationally. 

Obtaining
and maintaining marketing approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction would not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or
maintain marketing approval in any other jurisdiction, while a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one jurisdiction may
have a negative effect on the marketing approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product
candidate, comparable foreign regulatory authorities must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate
in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different
from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, as clinical trials conducted
in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States,
a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price
that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended
to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis
of foreign data alone unless (i) the data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; (ii) the trials were performed
by clinical investigators of recognized competence and pursuant to GCP regulations; and (iii) the data may be considered valid without
the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA, or if the FDA considers such inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the
data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. 

Regulatory
authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States have requirements for approval of product candidates with which we must comply
prior to marketing in those jurisdictions. Obtaining foreign marketing approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements
could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain
countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or receive applicable marketing approvals,
our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed. If we
obtain approval for any product candidate and ultimately commercialize that product in foreign markets, we would be subject to additional
risks and uncertainties, including the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements
and the reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries. 

Even
if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which
may result in significant additional expense and limit how we manufacture and market our products. 

Any
product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to extensive and ongoing requirements of and review by the FDA
or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including requirements related to the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data,
labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, recordkeeping, export, import, advertising, marketing, and promotional
activities for such product. These requirements further include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information, including
manufacturing deviations and reports, registration and listing requirements, the payment of annual fees, continued compliance with cGMP
requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance, and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and
GCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. 

The
FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities will continue to closely monitor the safety profile of any product even after approval.
If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of any of our product candidates,
they may withdraw approval, issue public safety alerts, require labeling changes or establishment of a REMS or similar strategy, impose
significant restrictions on a product s indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval
studies or post-market surveillance. Any such restrictions could limit sales of the product. 

58 

We
and any of our suppliers or collaborators, including our contract manufacturers, could be subject to periodic announced and unannounced
inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMPs and other FDA regulatory requirements. Application holders must further
notify the FDA, and depending on the nature of the change, obtain FDA pre-approval for product and manufacturing changes. 

In
addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or of the product being less effective than previously thought or other
problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements both before and
after approval, may yield various negative results, including: 

restrictions
 on manufacturing, distribution, or marketing of such products; 

restrictions
 on the labeling, including required additional warnings, such as black boxed warnings, contraindications, precautions, and restrictions
 on the approved indication or use; 

modifications
 to promotional pieces; 

issuance
 of corrective information; 

requirements
 to conduct post-marketing studies or other clinical trials; 

clinical
 holds or termination of clinical trials; 

requirements
 to establish or modify a REMS or similar strategy; 

changes
 to the way the product candidate is administered; 

liability
 for harm caused to patients or subjects; 

reputational
 harm; 

the
 product becoming less competitive; 

warning,
 untitled, or cyber letters; 

suspension
 of marketing or withdrawal of the products from the market; 

regulatory
 authority issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings
 or other safety information about the product candidate; 

refusal
 to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit; 

recalls
 of products; 

fines,
 restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues; 

suspension
 or withdrawal of marketing approvals; 

59 

refusal
 to permit the import or export of our products; 

product
 seizure or detention; 

FDA
 debarment, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion
 from federal healthcare programs, consent decrees, or corporate integrity agreements; or 

injunctions
 or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including imprisonment. 

Any
of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, or
could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing such product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating
significant revenues from its marketing and sale. Any of these events could have other material and adverse effects on our operations
and business and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

The
FDA s policies or those of comparable foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted
that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates, limit the marketability of our product candidates,
or impose additional regulatory obligations on us. Changes in medical practice and standard of care may also impact the marketability
of our product candidates. 

If
we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements, standards of care, or the adoption of new requirements or policies,
or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and be subject
to regulatory enforcement action. 

Should
any of the above actions take place, we could be prevented from or significantly delayed in achieving profitability. Further, the cost
of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operations and business and could adversely impact our
business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

Risks
Related to Manufacturing 

We
are subject to multiple manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our product candidates. 

The
manufacture of biopharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced
manufacturing techniques and process controls. The process of manufacturing viral immunotherapies, including our product candidates,
is particularly complex, time consuming, highly regulated and costly. 

Manufacturers
of therapeutics often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production, with such risks including: 

quality
 control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing; 

shortages
 of qualified personnel or key raw materials or components; 

product
 loss during the manufacturing process, including loss caused by contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation
 of equipment, or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields,
 product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or in the
 manufacturing facilities in which our products are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period
 of time to investigate and remedy the contamination; 

60 

the
 manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures, natural disasters,
 power failures and numerous other factors; and 

any
 adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot
 failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our product candidates. We may also have to take
 inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for product candidate batches that fail to meet specifications, undertake
 costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. 

As
product candidates are developed through preclinical studies to later-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it
is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in
an effort to optimize processes and results. 

Changes
in product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay. 

We
previously engaged a third-party contract manufacturing organization CMO that specializes in the manufacture of vaccines
to produce clinical-grade Olvi-Vec for all of our prior clinical trials. 

We
have leased a building in San Diego, California and have established and equipped our own cGMP manufacturing facility in order to secure
supplies for pivotal studies and commercial launch. This building is intended to give us control over key aspects of the supply chain
for our products and product candidates and has additional space for expansion. We recently leased a second building in the same location
which, when upgrades are completed, will provide laboratory capabilities and administrative offices. 

We
have developed a proprietary process for larger-scale manufacturing using a closed, mammalian-cell-based production system. This
process has been implemented in our manufacturing facility and has produced and is intended to produce Olvi-Vec and other clinical
products for use in our clinical trials and in our commercial launches. We may also make further changes to our
manufacturing facilities and processes at various points during development or commercialization, for a number of reasons, such as
controlling costs, achieving scale, decreasing processing time, increasing manufacturing success rate, improving product quality or
for other reasons. The manufacturing changes could require changes in raw materials, components and services that are obtained from
third-party suppliers. The inability of suppliers to provide those supplies or services or delays in acquiring the supplies or
services would delay the manufacture of clinical or commercial product supplies. 

These
changes carry the risk that they will not achieve their intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates
to perform differently and affect the results of our planned or future clinical trials. In some circumstances, changes in the facility
or the manufacturing process, as was done with regard to changing to mammalian-cell manufacture, require notification to, or authorization
by the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority, which may be delayed or which we may never receive. Such changes may also require,
prior to undertaking more advanced clinical trials, additional non-clinical or clinical testing, to show the comparability of the product
used in earlier clinical phases or at earlier portions of a trial to the product used in later clinical phases or later portions of the
trial. For example, we previously modified our manufacturing process and had to demonstrate analytical comparability to the FDA in order
to use Olvi-Vec manufactured by this process in our ongoing Phase 3 PRROC trial. Any future changes to our manufacturing process may
similarly require comparability assessments by the FDA and could delay clinical trials or, if the product of the modified manufacturing
process is not comparable, result in inconsistencies in trial results that may be difficult to explain. 

61 

Even
if the FDA agrees the products are comparable, the products may, in fact, perform differently and affect the results of our ongoing,
planned or future clinical trials. This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or
studies, require the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidates
and/or jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. 

We
may rely on CMOs to conduct large-scale manufacture of Olvi-Vec in the future. The inability to identify and contract with suitable CMOs
or their failure to meet their obligations to us could affect our ability to develop or commercialize Olvi-Vec in a timely manner. 

If
the FDA, state or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve our manufacturing facility for the manufacture of our product
candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, or our current facility is unable to meet our volume requirements, we
may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which may significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval
for or market our product candidates, if approved. Any alternative manufacturing facility would require obtaining the necessary equipment
and materials and, if a third-party manufacturer, the necessary manufacturing know-how, which may take substantial time and investment.
We must also receive FDA approval for the use of any manufacturing facility for commercial supply. 

In
such instance, we may need to enter into an appropriate third-party relationship. We may not succeed in our efforts to establish manufacturing
relationships or other alternative arrangements for any of our product candidates or programs. Any product candidates we develop compete
with other products and product candidates for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate
under cGMP regulations that are both capable of manufacturing and filling our viral product for us and willing to do so. 

Reliance
on third-party providers for certain manufacturing activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of
our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required regulations. Under certain circumstances, these third-party providers may be
entitled to terminate their engagements with us. If a third-party provider terminates its engagement with us, or does not successfully
carry out its contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or manufacture Olvi-Vec or any other product candidates in accordance with
regulatory requirements, or if there are disagreements between us and a third-party provider, we may need to identify and qualify replacement
suppliers, which may not be readily available or available on acceptable terms. In this instance, we may not be able to complete, or
may be delayed in completing, the preclinical studies required to support future IND submissions, the clinical trials required for approval,
and commercial supply of Olvi-Vec or any other product candidate, which would thereby have a negative impact on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. 

If
we are unable to manufacture and release any product candidates in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or fail to comply with
stringent regulations applicable to biopharmaceutical manufacturers, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of,
or be unable to meet demand for, any product candidates, and may lose potential revenues. 

We
intend to self-manufacture our clinical trial and commercial product supplies for the foreseeable future. We currently have only one
manufacturing facility for use in our clinical trials. Our clinical product supply may be limited, interrupted, or of unsatisfactory
quality or may be unavailable at acceptable prices. Any delays in obtaining adequate supplies of our product candidates that meet the
necessary quality standards may delay our development or commercialization. 

62 

We
may be unable to comply with our specifications, applicable cGMP requirements or other FDA, state or foreign regulatory requirements
of our product candidates for clinical trials and, if approved, commercial supply, and will be subject to FDA and comparable foreign
regulatory authority inspection. These requirements include the qualification and validation of our manufacturing equipment and processes.
We may not be able to develop, retain or acquire the internal expertise and resources necessary for effectively managing our ongoing
manufacturing operations and complying with these requirements. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of
adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of a product candidate that may not
be detectable in final product testing. If we cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict
regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for
our manufacturing facility. Any such deviations may also require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us to
implement, particularly in areas relating to operations, quality, regulatory, facilities and information technology. Any such remedial
measures imposed upon us may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or the temporary or permanent closure
of our facility and could materially harm our business. 

A
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, including periodic regulatory inspections, may result in regulatory enforcement
actions against us or our raw material and component suppliers (including fines and civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment),
suspension or restrictions of production, injunctions, delay or denial of product approval or supplements to approved products, clinical
holds or termination of clinical trials, warning or untitled letters, regulatory authority communications warning the public about safety
issues with the product candidate, refusal to permit the import or export of the products, product seizure, detention, or recall, operating
restrictions, consent decrees, withdrawal of product approval, environmental or safety incidents and other liabilities. If the safety
of any quantities supplied is compromised due to our failure or our raw material and component suppliers failure to adhere to
applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product
candidates. 

Any
problems or delays we experience in commercial-scale manufacturing of a product candidate or component may result in a delay in product
development timelines and FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority approval of the product candidate or may impair our ability
to manufacture commercial quantities or such quantities at an acceptable cost and quality, which could result in the delay, prevention,
or impairment of clinical development and commercialization of any product candidates and may materially harm our business, financial
condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

Risks
Related to Reliance on Third Parties 

We
rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to supply and quality-test the ingredients for our product candidates and components
for our manufacturing process, and to package and distribute our products. 

While
we are responsible for the manufacturing of our product candidates, drug substance and drug product, reliance on raw material and component
suppliers entails risks, including: 

reduced
 control for certain aspects of our manufacturing activities; 

termination
 or nonrenewal of the applicable supplier and service agreements in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us; 

63 

variability
 of properly released raw materials between batches from a single supplier or between suppliers; 

the
 possible breach by our third-party suppliers and service providers of our agreements with them; 

the
 failure of our third-party suppliers and service providers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements; 

the
 inability to provide adequate supplies of our product; 

disruptions
 to the operations of our third-party suppliers and service providers caused by conditions unrelated to our business or operations,
 including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or service provider; and 

the
 possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how. 

Any
failure or refusal to supply our product candidates, raw materials or components for our product candidates that we may develop could
delay, prevent or impair our clinical development or commercialization efforts. In addition, we do not have any long-term commitments
or guaranteed prices from our suppliers of raw materials, manufacturing equipment components or devices or combination products. In particular,
any change in our suppliers could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified replacements.
Further, the terms of any new arrangement could be less favorable and transfer costs relating to technology and processes could be significant. 

Any
of these events could lead to clinical trial delays or failure to obtain regulatory approval, impact our ability to successfully commercialize
any of our product candidates or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects.
Some of these events could be the basis for FDA or other regulatory authority action, including injunction, recall, seizure or total
or partial suspension of product manufacture. 

We
rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct, supervise, and monitor our preclinical studies and clinical trials.
If those third parties do not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or failing
to comply with regulatory requirements, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or any other product
candidates that we may develop in the future. 

We
rely, and will rely, on third-party CROs, study sites and others to conduct, supervise, and monitor our preclinical studies and clinical
trials for our product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations,
medical institutions, and clinical investigators, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Although we have agreements
governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance and control only certain aspects of their activities.
The failure of these third parties to successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines could substantially
harm our business because we may be delayed in completing or unable to complete the studies required to support future approval of our
product candidates, or we may not obtain marketing approval for or commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner or at all.
Moreover, these agreements might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need
to enter into alternative arrangements, our product development activities would be delayed and our business, financial condition, results
of operations, stock price and prospects may be materially harmed. 

64 

Our
reliance on these third parties for development activities will reduce our control over these activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible
for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards
and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for
ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. We must
also ensure that our preclinical studies are conducted in accordance with the FDA s Good Laboratory Practice regulations, as appropriate.
Moreover, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as GCP guidelines,
for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate
and that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements
through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of our third parties fail to comply
with applicable GCPs or other regulatory requirements, we or they may be subject to enforcement or other legal actions. For example,
the data generated in our trials may not have been appropriately collected or documented, and thereby be deemed unreliable and the FDA
or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may conclude the study findings are not adequate and require us to perform additional studies. 

In
addition, we will be required to report certain financial interests of our third-party investigators if these relationships exceed certain
financial thresholds or meet other criteria. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may question the integrity of the data
from those clinical trials conducted by investigators who may have conflicts of interest. 

We
cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our trials
comply with the applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates that were
produced under cGMP regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay
the regulatory approval process. We also are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical
trials on one or more government-sponsored databases, e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result
in enforcement actions and adverse publicity. 

The
third parties with which we work may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, for whom they
may also be conducting trials or other therapeutic development activities that could harm our competitive position. In addition, such
third parties are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties we cannot control
whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, non-clinical, and preclinical programs. If these third
parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our preclinical studies or clinical
trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy
of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our
trials may be repeated, extended, delayed, or terminated; we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals
for our product candidates; we may not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates;
or we or they may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for
our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. To the extent
we are unable to successfully identify and manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business, financial
condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects may be materially harmed. 

65 

If
any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative providers
or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional third parties involves additional cost and requires management
time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new third party commences work. As a result, delays could occur,
which could compromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines. 

We
will also rely on other third parties to store and distribute our product candidates for the clinical trials that we conduct. Any performance
failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development, marketing approval, or commercialization of our product candidates,
which could result in additional losses and deprive us of potential product revenue. 

We
have entered into, and may in the future enter into, certain collaboration agreements and strategic alliances to maximize the potential
of our product candidates, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such collaborations or alliances. We expect to continue
to form collaborations in the future with respect to our product candidates, but may be unable to do so or to realize the potential benefits
of such transactions, which may cause us to alter or delay our development and commercialization plans. 

We
may form or seek other strategic alliances, joint ventures, or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third
parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to product candidates we
develop. These transactions can entail numerous operational and financial risks, including exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption
of our business and diversion of our management s time and attention in order to manage a collaboration. We also cannot be certain
that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or other anticipated benefits that led us to enter into
the arrangement. Additionally, the success of any collaboration arrangements may depend on the efforts and activities of our collaborators.
Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these arrangements.
Disagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding clinical development and commercialization matters can lead to
delays in the development process or commercializing the applicable product candidate and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration
arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision-making authority. 

If
we are not able to establish future collaborations on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization
plans for one or more of our other development programs. 

We
face significant competition in seeking appropriate additional collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for any collaboration
will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of
the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of a number of factors. 

If
we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail
the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay
its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake
development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities
on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms,
or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development
and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to
develop our product platform and our business may be materially and adversely affected. 

66 

Our
current and any future collaborations are not a guarantee of success, and all collaborations are as risky, or more risky, than undertaking
the activities ourselves. 

Our
current collaborations with TVAX and Newsoara, and potential future collaborations we might enter into for Olvi-Vec or our other product
candidates, may pose a number of risks, including the following: 

collaborators
 may not perform their obligations as expected; 

collaborators
 may not pursue development and commercialization of product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue
 or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators strategic
 focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities; 

collaborators
 may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product
 candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; 

collaborators
 could fail to make timely regulatory submissions for a product candidate; 

collaborators
 may not comply with all applicable regulatory requirements or may fail to report safety data in accordance with all applicable regulatory
 requirements, which could subject them or us to regulatory enforcement actions; 

collaborators
 could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product
 candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized
 under terms that are more economically attractive than ours; 

product
 candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates
 or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates; 

a
 collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may
 not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product candidate or product; 

disagreements
 with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development,
 might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional
 responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time
 consuming and expensive; 

collaborators
 may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite
 litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;
 and 

collaborators
 may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability. 

67 

For
example, Newsoara is generally obligated under the Newsoara License Agreement to fund a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, and controlled
clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered Olvi-Vec oncolytic VACV for patients with recurrent
NSCLC in the United States, which VIRO-25 trial is now ongoing with the first patient dosed in October 2024. Newsoara has also agreed
to reimburse us for the costs and expenses of a CRO to conduct certain startup activities for the NSCLC trial in the United States only,
but is permitted to defer such reimbursement payments until the completion of its next round of financing, which Newsoara expects to
occur in late 2024. If Newsoara is unable or unwilling to provide this funding and/or reimbursement in a timely manner or at all, we
would need to obtain the funding on our own and/or scale back or discontinue these clinical development activities. 

In
addition, all of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this Quarterly Report
also apply to the activities of any of our current or future collaborators. 

Collaborations
with biopharmaceutical companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. Any such termination
or expiration could adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation. 

If
any collaborations we have entered into or might enter into do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products
or if one of our collaborators subsequently terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone
or royalty payments under such collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under the agreements, our development of our
product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop our product candidates and our product platform. 

Additionally,
if any collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination, the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate development or commercialization
of any product candidate licensed to it by us. If one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult
to attract new collaborators and our reputation in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected. 

We
face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for any collaboration
will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of
the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of a number of factors. 

If
we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail
the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay
its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake
development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities
on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms,
or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development
and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to
develop our product platform and our business may be materially and adversely affected. 

68 

Disruptions
at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire and
retain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a
timely manner, which could negatively impact our business. 

The
ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding
levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes.
Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies
that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. 

Disruptions
at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies,
which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22,
2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical
employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA
to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Separately,
the FDA and regulatory authorities outside the United States adopted restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19
pandemic that diverted resources and delayed their attention to routine submissions. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if
global health concerns prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory
activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory
submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Risks
Related to Commercialization 

If
we, or our collaboration partners, are unable to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval,
or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. 

If
we, or our collaboration partners, are successful in obtaining marketing approval from applicable regulatory authorities for Olvi-Vec
or any other product candidate, our ability to generate revenues from any such products will depend on our success in: 

launching
 commercial sales of such products, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 

receiving
 approved labels with claims that are necessary or desirable for successful marketing, and that do not contain safety or other limitations
 that would impede our ability to market such products; 

creating
 market demand for such products through marketing, sales and promotion activities; 

hiring,
 training, and deploying a sales force or contracting with third parties to commercialize such products in the United States; 

creating
 partnerships with, or offering licenses to, third parties to promote and sell such products in foreign markets where we receive marketing
 approval; 

manufacturing
 such products in sufficient quantities and at acceptable quality and cost to meet commercial demand at launch and thereafter; 

69 

establishing
 and maintaining agreements with wholesalers, distributors, and group purchasing organizations on commercially reasonable terms; 

maintaining
 patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for such products; 

achieving
 market acceptance of such products by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors; 

achieving
 coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for such products; 

achieving
 patients willingness to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; 

competing
 effectively with other therapies; and 

maintaining
 a continued acceptable safety profile of such products following launch. 

To
the extent we are not able to do any of the foregoing, our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects
will be materially harmed. 

We
face significant competition from other biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and
other research organizations, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products more quickly or marketing
them more successfully than us. If their product candidates are shown to be safer or more effective than ours, our commercial opportunity
may be reduced or eliminated. 

The
development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapy products is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition
and a strong emphasis on proprietary rights. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition
with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major biopharmaceutical companies,
specialty biopharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large biopharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of solid tumors, including
viral immunotherapy and cancer vaccine approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies, and
other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements
for research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization. 

We
are aware of a number of companies developing competing therapies for the treatment of cancer which generally fall into the following
treatment groups: 

Oncolytic
 viral immunotherapies, including Amgen s IMLYGIC (talimogene laherparepvec), the only FDA-approved oncolytic immunotherapy,
 which is approved for the local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent
 after initial surgery and is in development for several other indications and Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited s DELYTACT (teserpaturev/G47 ),
 which received conditional and time-limited marketing approval in Japan as a regenerative medical product for treatment of malignant
 glioma. Other oncolytic viral immunotherapies in development include those by companies such as AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca), Boehringer
 Ingelheim, CG Oncology, Inc., Candel Therapeutics, Inc., Imugene Limited, Johnson Johnson, Merck Co., Inc. (Merck), Oncolytics
 Biotech Inc., Otsuka Holdings Co. Ltd., Pfizer Inc., PsiOxus Therapeutics, Ltd., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Replimune Group,
 Inc., SillaJen, Inc. (SillaJen), Targovax USA, Theriva Biologics, Inc., Transgene SA (Transgene), Turnstone Biologics Corp. and Vyriad,
 Inc.; 

70 

Approved
 immunotherapy antibodies and immunotherapy agents in clinical development, including antibody agents, bispecific T cell engagers,
 including those in development by Amgen, and immuno-oncology companies focused on IL-12, such as Ziopharm Oncology Inc.; 

Cancer
 vaccines, including personalized vaccines and those targeting tumor neoantigens, including neoantigen therapies in development by
 companies such as Advaxis, Inc., Agenus Inc., AstraZeneca, Bavarian Nordic A/S, BioNTech SE, Genocea Biosciences, Inc., Gritstone
 Oncology, Inc., Heat Biologics, Inc., ImmunityBio, Inc., IMV Inc., Moderna, Inc., SOTIO a.s., Transgene, and VBI Vaccines Inc.; 

Cell-based
 therapies, including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in development by Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc., TVAX and Turnstone Biologics,
 Corp. and approved and in-development CAR T cell therapies, including those commercialized by BMS, Gilead Sciences Inc. and Novartis
 AG, T cell receptor and NK cell therapies; 

Therapies
 aimed at activating innate immunity such as those targeting stimulator of interferon genes protein (and toll-like receptors including
 those in development by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Checkmate Pharmaceuticals Inc., Chinook Therapeutics Inc., GlaxoSmithKline
 plc, Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Merck, Mologen AG, Nektar Therapeutics, TriSalus Life Sciences, and UroGen Pharma Inc.; and 

Traditional
 cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, surgery, radiation and targeted therapies. 

We
are aware of several other companies developing therapies based on VACV. To our knowledge, the only clinical product based on VACV that
has advanced beyond Phase 1 clinical development is Pexa-Vec, being jointly developed by SillaJen and Transgene. Pexa-Vec has a different
product profile from Olvi-Vec, including a different strain of VACV and different transgenes. In August 2019, SillaJen announced the
discontinuation of its Phase 3 PHOCUS trial of Pexa-Vec in advanced liver cancer for futility. 

We
are also aware of other companies either marketing or focused on developing competing therapies for the treatment of ovarian cancer,
including PRROC: 

Currently
marketed products for ovarian cancer include generic products cisplatin (manufactured by 18 companies), carboplatin (manufactured by
22 companies) and paclitaxel (manufactured by 19 companies), along with the following brand products (and generic manufacturers): Abbvie s
 Elahere , Sanofi-Aventis s Taxotere 
(17 manufacturers), Celgene Corp. s Abraxane (one manufacturer), Esai Inc. s
 Hexalen , Roche Holding AG s (Roche) Xeloda ,
Roche/Genentech, Inc. s Avastin (four manufacturers), Baxter Healthcare s
 Cytoxan and lfex , Etoposide (10 manufacturers),
Eli Lilly and Company s Gemzar (15 manufacturers) and Alimta
 (14 manufacturers), Pfizer Inc. s CamPtosar (19 manufacturers), Janssen Pharmaceutical s
 Doxil (one manufacturer), Aspen Pharmacare s Alkeran ,
Meitheal Pharmaceuticals s Topotecan , Laboratoires Pierre Fabre s Navelbine
 (four manufacturers), GSK s Zejula, AstraZeneca s Lynparza , and pharmaand
GMBH s Rubraca . 

Product
candidates in registration trials or later development for PRROC include: 

Nemvaleukin
 alfa, an engineered interleukin-2 by Mural Oncology; 

71 

Relacorilant,
 an anti-glucocorticoid, by Corcept Therapeutics Inc.; 

Luveltamab
 tazevibulin, an anti-folate receptor alpha (FolR antibody drug conjugate (ADC), by Sutro Biopharma; 

Navicixizumab,
 an anti-DLL4/VEGF bispecific antibody, by OncXerna Therapeutics, Inc. in partnership with Mereo Biopharma Group PLC; 

Raludotatug
 deruxtecan, a CDH6 directed DXd ADC, developed by Daichii Sankyo; 

Anlotinib,
 a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, developed by Advenchen Laboratories; and 

Afureserib,
 an ATP-competitive AKT inhibitor, developed by Laekna Therapeutics. 

While
certain of our product candidates may be used in combination with other drugs with different mechanisms of action, if and when marketed
they will still compete with a number of drugs that are currently marketed or in development that also target cancer. To compete effectively
with these drugs, our product candidates will need to demonstrate advantages in clinical efficacy and safety compared to these competitors
when used alone or in combination with other drugs. 

Our
commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective,
have fewer or less severe side effects, are easier to administer or are less expensive alone or in combination with other therapies than
any products that we may develop alone or in combination with other therapies. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or comparable foreign
regulatory authorities approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our
competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be
affected in many cases by third-party payors coverage and reimbursement decisions. 

Many
of the companies with which we are competing or may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise
in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing
approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more
resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors,
particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting
and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical
trials, as well as in developing or acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. If we are unable to successfully
compete with these companies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects may be materially harmed. 

If
we are unable to establish effective marketing, sales and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market
and sell our product candidates, if they are approved, the revenues that we generate may be limited and we may never become profitable. 

We
currently do not have a commercial infrastructure for the marketing, sale, and distribution of any products that we may develop. If and
when our product candidates receive marketing approval, we intend to commercialize our product candidates on our own or in collaboration
with others and potentially with pharmaceutical or biotechnology partners in other geographies. In order to commercialize our products,
we must build our marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
We may not be successful in doing so. Should we decide to move forward in developing our own marketing capabilities, we may incur expenses
prior to product launch or even approval in order to recruit a sales force and develop a marketing and sales infrastructure. If a commercial
launch is delayed as a result of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements or other reasons, we would incur these
expenses prior to being able to realize any revenue from sales of our product candidates. Even if we are able to effectively hire a sales
force and develop a marketing and sales infrastructure, our sales force and marketing teams may not be successful in commercializing
our product candidates. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing
personnel. 

72 

We
may also or alternatively decide to collaborate with third-party marketing and sales organizations to commercialize any approved product
candidates, in which event, our ability to generate product revenues may be limited. To the extent we rely on third parties to commercialize
any products for which we obtain regulatory approval, we may receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves,
which could materially harm our prospects. In addition, we would have less control over the sales efforts of any other third parties
involved in our commercialization efforts, and could be held liable if they failed to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements. 

We
have no prior experience in the marketing, sale, and distribution of biopharmaceutical products, and there are significant risks involved
in building and managing a commercial infrastructure. The establishment and development of commercial capabilities, including compliance
plans, to market any products we may develop will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and we may not
be able to successfully develop this capability. We will have to compete with other biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including
oncology-focused companies, to recruit, hire, train, manage, and retain marketing and sales personnel, which is expensive and time consuming
and could delay any product launch. Developing our sales capabilities may also divert resources and management attention away from product
development. 

In
the event we are unable to develop a marketing and sales infrastructure, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates,
which could limit our ability to generate product revenues and materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations,
stock price and prospects. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates include: 

the
 inability to recruit, train, manage, and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel; 

the
 inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or educate adequate numbers of physicians on the benefits of prescribing
 our product candidates; 

our
 inability to effectively oversee a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team; 

the
 costs associated with training personnel, including sales and marketing personnel, on compliance matters and monitoring their actions; 

an
 inability to secure coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government and private health plans; 

the
 unwillingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; 

the
 clinical indications for which the products are approved and the claims that we may make for the products; 

limitations
 or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the products approved labeling; 

any
 distribution and use restrictions imposed by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities or to which we agree as part of
 a mandatory REMS or voluntary risk management plan; 

73 

liability
 for our personnel, including sales or marketing personnel, who fail to comply with applicable law; 

the
 lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies
 with more extensive product lines; and 

unforeseen
 costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization or engaging a contract sales organization. 

Even
if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians,
patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.
The revenues that we generate from their sales may be limited, and we may never become profitable. 

We
have never commercialized a product candidate for any indication. Even if our product candidates are approved by the appropriate regulatory
authorities for marketing and sale, they may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical
community. If any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval does not gain an adequate level of market acceptance, we
could be prevented from or significantly delayed in achieving profitability. Market acceptance of our product candidates by the medical
community, patients, and third-party payors will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, physicians
are often reluctant to switch their patients and patients may be reluctant to switch from existing therapies even when new and potentially
more effective or safer treatments enter the market. 

Efforts
to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and
may not be successful. If any of our product candidates is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, we could
be prevented from or significantly delayed in achieving profitability. The degree of market acceptance of any product for which we receive
marketing approval will depend on a number of factors, including: 

the
 efficacy of our product, including in combination with other cancer therapies; 

the
 commercial success of any cancer therapies with which our product may be co-administered; 

the
 prevalence and severity of adverse events associated with our product or those products with which it is co-administered; 

the
 clinical indications for which our product is approved and the approved claims that we may make with respect to the product; 

limitations
 or warnings contained in the FDA-approved labeling of the product or the labeling approved by comparable foreign regulatory authorities,
 including potential limitations or warnings for our product that may be more restrictive than other competitive products; 

changes
 in the standard of care for the targeted indications for our product, which could reduce the marketing impact of any claims that
 we could make following FDA approval or approval by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, if obtained; 

the
 relative convenience and ease of administration of our product and any products with which it is co-administered; 

74 

the
 cost of treatment compared with the economic and clinical benefit of alternative treatments or therapies; 

the
 availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, such as private insurance companies and government healthcare
 programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; 

the
 ability to have our product placed on approved formularies; 

patients 
 willingness to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; 

the
 price concessions required by third-party payors to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement; 

the
 extent and strength of our marketing and distribution of our product; 

the
 safety, efficacy, and other potential advantages over, and availability of, alternative treatments already used or that may later
 be approved; 

distribution
 and use restrictions imposed by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities with respect to our product or to which we agree
 as part of a REMS or voluntary risk management plan; 

the
 timing of market introduction of our product, as well as competitive products; 

our
 ability to offer our product for sale at competitive prices; 

the
 willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; 

the
 extent and strength of our raw material supplier and service provider support; 

the
 actions of companies that market any products with which our product is co-administered; 

the
 approval of other new products; 

adverse
 publicity about our product or any products with which it is co-administered, or favorable publicity about competitive products;
 and 

potential
 product liability claims. 

The
size of the potential market for our product candidates is difficult to estimate and, if any of our assumptions are inaccurate, the actual
markets for our product candidates may be smaller than our estimates. If the market opportunities for any product candidates we develop
are smaller than we believe they are, our potential revenues may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer. 

The
potential market opportunities for our product candidates are difficult to estimate and will depend in large part on the drugs with which
our product candidates are co-administered and the success of competing therapies and therapeutic approaches. In particular, the market
opportunity for viral immunotherapies is hard to estimate given that it is an emerging field with only one existing FDA-approved viral
immunotherapy, T-VEC, which has yet to enjoy broad market acceptance. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases,
as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are
based on estimates. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities are predicated on many assumptions, which may include industry
knowledge and publications, third-party research reports, and other surveys. Although we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable,
these assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment on the part of our management, are inherently uncertain, and their reasonableness
has not been assessed by an independent source. These estimates may prove to be incorrect and new studies may change the estimated incidence
or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected,
and patients may not be amenable to treatment with our product. If any of the assumptions proves to be inaccurate, the actual markets
for our product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunities. Additionally, because of the potential
that any product candidates we develop could cure a target disease, we may not receive recurring revenues from patients and may deplete
the patient population prevalence through curative therapy. 

75 

Negative
developments in the field of immuno-oncology could damage public perception of our oncolytic VACV platform and our product candidates,
including Olvi-Vec, and negatively affect our business. 

The
commercial success of our product candidates will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of cancer viral immunotherapies. Adverse
events in clinical trials of our product candidates, including Olvi-Vec, or in clinical trials of others developing similar products
and the resulting publicity, as well as any other negative developments with respect to the field of immuno-oncology that may occur in
the future, including in connection with competitor therapies, or with respect to products with which our product is co-administered,
could result in a decrease in demand for Olvi-Vec or any other product candidates that we may develop. These events could also result
in the suspension, discontinuation, or clinical hold of or modification to our clinical trials. If public perception is influenced by
claims that the use of cancer immunotherapies is unsafe, whether related to our therapies or those of our competitors, our product candidates
may not be accepted by the general public or the medical community and potential clinical trial subjects may be discouraged from enrolling
in our clinical trials. As a result, we may not be able to continue or may be delayed in conducting our development programs. 

As
our product candidates consist of oncolytic VACVs, adverse developments in anti-cancer vaccines or clinical trials of other viral immunotherapy
products based on viruses may result in a disproportionately negative effect for Olvi-Vec or our other product candidates as compared
to other products in the field of immuno- oncology that are not based on viruses. We do not fully understand the biological characteristics
of our therapeutic viruses, and their interactions with other drugs and the human immune and other defense systems, which may cause us
to fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates in clinical trials. Therapeutic viruses are novel, and
we are still determining the biological characteristics of these viruses. In addition, we are still investigating the response of the
human immune system to our therapeutic viruses, and the immune system may play a role in limiting their tumor-killing effect. We also
do not know the extent to which therapeutic viruses and our treatment processes may be toxic. Moreover, we do not understand all of the
many factors that contribute to the formation of each individual patient s cancer; these factors make each tumor unique. The novelty
and scientific uncertainties regarding our therapeutic viruses and the uniqueness of human cancers from patient to patient increase the
risk that we will not successfully develop our product candidates or prove their safety and effectiveness in clinical trials. Even if
we succeed in developing our product candidates, our product candidates may not have a therapeutic effect in a broad patient population. 

Future
negative developments in the field of immuno-oncology or the biopharmaceutical industry could also result in greater governmental regulation,
stricter labeling requirements and potential regulatory delays in the testing or approvals of our products. Any increased scrutiny could
delay or increase the costs of obtaining marketing approval for Olvi-Vec or our other product candidates.

Risks
Related to Our Intellectual Property 

If
we are unable to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights for our technology and product candidates, or if our intellectual
property rights are inadequate, our competitive position could be harmed. 

Our
commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the
United States and other countries with respect to our technology, including our oncolytic VACV platform, and Olvi-Vec, V2ACT Immunotherapy
and our other product candidates. We also rely in part on trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing
and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. We seek to protect our proprietary
position by filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our technology and product candidates. 

The
patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions
and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial
value of our licensed patents and any patents we own are highly uncertain. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights
may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights,
both inside and outside of the United States. 

Further,
the examination process may require us to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent
protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being
issued that protect our product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive
product candidates. The scope of a patent may also be reinterpreted after issuance. The rights that may be granted under our issued patents
may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. Even if our patent applications issue as
patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us
or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology
or for Olvi-Vec, V2ACT Immunotherapy or our other product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient,
our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or superior to ours in a non-infringing manner, and our ability to successfully
commercialize Olvi-Vec, V2ACT Immunotherapy or our other product candidates and future technologies may be adversely affected. It is
also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization
activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. 

In
addition, the patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain,
enforce or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Although we enter into
non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and
development output, such as our employees, collaborators, and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and
disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. It is also possible
that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development efforts in time to obtain patent protection. 

77 

For
the core technology in our CHOICE platform and Olvi-Vec and our other product candidates, patents have issued and applications are pending
at each of the U.S. provisional, Patent Cooperation Treaty, and national stages with, at a minimum, filings submitted to the United States,
European Patent Conventions and Japan. As of September 30, 2024, our patent portfolio consisted of 11 issued U.S. patents, one pending
U.S. patent application, 9 issued foreign patents, and six pending foreign patent applications, which relate generally to the composition
of our current and potential future products, and their methods of use. V2ACT LLC has exclusive rights to V2ACT Immunotherapy under one
issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. patent application and two pending non-U.S. patent applications. Any future provisional patent
applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within
12 months of filing of one or more of our related provisional patent applications. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent
applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions
disclosed in our provisional patent applications. Although we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our
provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any of our future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents
that effectively protect our technology or Olvi-Vec, V2ACT Immunotherapy or our other product candidates, or if any of our future issued
patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products. We may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission
of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ). Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature
often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published
until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all until they are issued as a patent. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were
the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection
of such inventions. 

Our
pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the inventions claimed in such applications unless and until
a patent issues from such applications with a claim that covers infringing third-party activity. Because the issuance of a patent is
not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we license from third parties or own in
the future may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad, including through opposition proceedings,
derivation proceedings, post-grant review, inter partes review, interference proceedings or litigation. Such proceedings may result
in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which
could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical products, or limit the duration of the patent
protection for our technology. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our patented inventions, trademarks and other intellectual
property rights is expensive, time consuming, difficult and in some cases may not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or
impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent
claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult. If we are unable to obtain, maintain, and protect our intellectual
property, our competitive advantage could be harmed, and it could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

If
we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we may license intellectual property rights from third parties or
otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are
important to our business. 

We
may need to obtain licenses from others to advance our research and development activities or allow the commercialization of our current
or future product candidates. We expect any such license agreements will impose various development, diligence, commercialization, and
other obligations on us. In spite of our efforts, our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our obligations under
such license agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to develop and
commercialize products and technology covered by the intellectual property under any such license agreements. If such in-licenses were
to be terminated, or if the underlying patents were to fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors or other third parties would
have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours and we may be required to cease our development
and commercialization our product candidates. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position,
business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects. 

78 

Moreover,
disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including: 

the
 scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues; 

the
 extent to which our product candidates, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject
 to the licensing agreement; 

the
 sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships; 

our
 diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; 

the
 inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors
 and us and our partners; and 

the
 priority of invention of patented technology. 

In
addition, the agreements under which we may license intellectual property or technology from third parties are likely to be complex,
and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation
disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology,
or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property
that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms,
we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects. 

If
we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could
be adversely affected. 

In
addition to seeking patent protection, we also rely on other proprietary rights, including protection of trade secrets, know-how and
confidential and proprietary information. To maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information, we enter
into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators, contractors, and other third parties who have access
to our trade secrets. Our agreements with employees and consultants also provide that any inventions conceived by the individual employee
or consultant in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property. However, we may not obtain these agreements
in all circumstances, and individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms. The assignment of intellectual
property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against
third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.
In addition, we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that
competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques.
In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information, these agreements, even if obtained, may
not provide meaningful protection, particularly for our trade secrets or other confidential information. To the extent that our employees,
consultants or contractors use technology or know-how owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise between us and
those third parties as to the rights in related inventions. 

79 

Adequate
remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information including a breach of our confidentiality
agreements. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time consuming,
and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in and outside of the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect
trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party,
we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. The disclosure of our trade secrets
or the independent development of our trade secrets by a competitor or other third party would impair our competitive position and may
materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

Third
parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would
be uncertain and could harm our business. 

Our
commercial success depends on our ability and the ability of any future collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell Olvi-Vec
and our other product candidates, and to use our related proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating
the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized
by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. We may become party to, or threatened with, adversarial
proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current and any other future product candidates,
including interference proceedings, post-grant review, inter partes review and derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Third
parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted
in the future. Numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the
fields in which we are pursuing development candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are
issued, the risk increases that we may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. If we are found to
infringe a third party s intellectual property rights, and we are unsuccessful in demonstrating that such intellectual property
rights are invalid or unenforceable, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing, manufacturing
and commercializing Olvi-Vec and our other product candidates. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially
reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other
third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments.
We also could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing, and commercializing Olvi-Vec or our other product
candidates. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for significant monetary damages, including treble
damages and attorneys fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. Any of
the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects.
Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar material
adverse effect on our business. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and
would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. 

Parties
making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have
substantially greater resources. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual
property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by
disclosure. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have material adverse
effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects. 

80 

Furthermore,
we plan to develop our product candidates in combination with products developed by companies that may be covered by patents or licenses
held by those entities to which we do not have a license or a sublicense. In the event that a labeling instruction is required in product
packaging recommending that combination, we could be accused of, or held liable for, infringement of the third-party patents covering
the product candidate or product recommended for administration with Olvi-Vec or our other product candidates. In such a case, we could
be required to obtain a license from the other company or institution to use the required or desired package labeling, which may not
be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 

We
may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world. 

Filing,
prosecuting and defending patents on our technology throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property
rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws and practices
of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States.
Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States,
or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may
use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop and/or manufacture their own products,
and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as
that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may
not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing. 

Many
companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions.
The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the granting or enforcement of patents,
trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult
for us to obtain patent rights or stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual
property and proprietary rights generally in those countries. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights
in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could
put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke
third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded,
if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary
rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property we develop or license. 

In
addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and those
foreign laws may also be subject to change. For example, methods of treatment and manufacturing processes may not be patentable in certain
jurisdictions, and the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries. Furthermore, biosimilar product manufacturers
or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity and enforceability of our patents, requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy
and costly litigation or proceedings. 

Moreover,
many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. Many countries
limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have
limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we are forced to grant a license to third parties with
respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business and results of operations
may be adversely affected. 

81 

Obtaining
and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements
imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 

The
USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other
similar provisions during the patent application process and to maintain patents after they are issued. For example, periodic maintenance
fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on issued patents and patent applications often must be paid to the
USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of our licensed patents or any patents we own. In certain circumstances, we may rely
on future licensing partners to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to licensed intellectual property.
Although an unintentional lapse can be cured for a period of time by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable
rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting
in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or
lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time
limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to obtain and maintain the patents
and patent applications covering our products or procedures, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products that are
the same as or similar to Olvi-Vec or our other product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Changes
to the patent law in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our
ability to protect Olvi-Vec, V2ACT Immunotherapy and our other product candidates. 

As
is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents.
Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly,
time consuming and inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States
or other jurisdictions in which we have or seek patent protection could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution
of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Patent reform legislation in the United States and other countries,
including the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the Leahy-Smith Act signed into law in the United States on September 16,
2011, could increase those uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense
of our issued patents. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that
affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors
to challenge the validity of patents. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution
and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review,
 inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned to
a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that the other statutory requirements are met, the first inventor to file a patent
application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention.
However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent
applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

82 

The
U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain
circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S.
courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable
ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. 

We
may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful
and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. 

Competitors
may infringe our licensed patents or any patent we own, or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. Litigation
may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the
validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. If we were to initiate legal proceedings
against a third party to enforce a patent covering our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering
our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity
and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory
requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, written description or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion
could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a
misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable.
Our licensed patents and any patents we own in the future may become involved in priority or other intellectual property related disputes.
Interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine
the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. Also, third parties may initiate legal proceedings against
us to challenge the validity or scope of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights. These proceedings can be expensive and time
consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to conduct intellectual
property related litigations or proceedings than we can. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation
or proceedings adequately. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating
our intellectual property. Litigation and other intellectual property related proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion
of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may
decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology
at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or other intellectual
property related proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. 

Furthermore,
because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation in the United States, there
is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also
be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments in any such proceedings. If
securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares
of our common stock, and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials,
continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help
us bring our product candidates to market. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition,
results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

83 

We
may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we, our employees or any future collaborators have misappropriated their intellectual
property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property. 

Many
of our employees, including our senior management team, were previously employed at, or consulted for, universities or other biotechnology
or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these people, including each member of our senior
management team, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with
such previous employment or consulting agreements, that assigned ownership of intellectual property relating to work performed under
such agreements to the contracting third party. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use, claim as theirs, or misappropriate
the intellectual property, proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or
these employees have used, claimed as theirs, misappropriated or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary
information, of any such individual s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If
we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel
or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license
from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,
or at all. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction
to management. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock
price and prospects. 

We
may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of
third parties or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors. 

We
could be subject to claims that we or our employees, including senior management, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged
trade secrets or other confidential information of former employers or competitors or others. Although we try to ensure that our employees
and consultants do not use the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for
us, we may be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of their non-competition or non-solicitation agreement,
or that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information
of a former employer or competitor or other party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful
in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. If our defenses
to these claims fail, in addition to requiring us to pay monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features
that are essential to Olvi-Vec and our other product candidates, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived
from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers, competitors or other parties. An inability to incorporate
such technologies or features would have a material adverse effect on our business, and may prevent us from successfully commercializing
Olvi-Vec and our other product candidates. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel as a result of
such claims. Moreover, any such litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or consultants. A
loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop and commercialize Olvi-Vec and our other product
candidates, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

84 

If
we obtain any issued patents covering our technology, such patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or
before the USPTO or comparable foreign regulatory authority. 

If
we or one of our licensing partners initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering any of our technology,
the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in
the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon
which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Grounds for a validity challenge could be, among other things,
an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, or non-enablement. Grounds
for an unenforceability assertion could be, among other things, an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld
relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims
before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination,
 inter partes review, post-grant review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings and equivalent proceedings in foreign
jurisdictions, such as opposition proceedings. Such proceedings could result in revocation, cancellation or amendment to our patents
in such a way that they no longer cover and protect Olvi-Vec, V2ACT Immunotherapy and our other product candidates. The outcome following
legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. For example, with respect to the validity of our licensed patents
or any patents we obtain in the future, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we, our patent counsel
or our licensing partner s patent counsel(s), and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party were to
prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection
on Olvi-Vec, V2ACT Immunotherapy and our other product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact
on our business. 

Patent
terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time, and our product candidates
for which we intend to seek approval as biological products may face competition sooner than anticipated. 

Patents
have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally
20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection
it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open
to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing
and regulatory review of new product candidates, such as Olvi-Vec and our other product candidates, patents protecting such candidates
might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not
provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. 

In
the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits a patent term extension of up to five years
beyond the normal expiration of the patent, but no longer than 14 years from the product s approval date, which is limited to the
approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension). However, the applicable authorities, including
the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, may not agree with our assessment
of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than
we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing
our clinical and preclinical data and launch their products earlier than might otherwise be the case, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

85 

The
enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 BPCIA as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA created an abbreviated
pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal
authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biological products, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable 
based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by
the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. Certain changes, however, and supplements to an approved
BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity
do not qualify for the 12-year exclusivity period. 

Olvi-Vec
and our other product candidates are all biological product candidates. We anticipate being awarded market exclusivity for each of our
biological product candidates that is subject to its own BLA for 12 years in the United States, 10 years in Europe and significant durations
in other markets. However, the term of the patents that cover such product candidates may not extend beyond the applicable market exclusivity
awarded by a particular country. For example, in the United States, if all of the patents that cover our particular biological product
expire before the 12-year market exclusivity expires, a third party could submit a marketing application for a biosimilar product four
years after approval of our biological product, the FDA could immediately review the application and approve the biosimilar product for
marketing 12 years after approval of our biological product, and the biosimilar sponsor could then immediately begin marketing. Alternatively,
a third party could submit a full BLA for a similar or identical product any time after approval of our biological product, and the FDA
could immediately review and approve the similar or identical product for marketing and the third party could begin marketing the similar
or identical product upon expiry of all of the patents that cover our particular biological product. 

There
is also a risk that this exclusivity could be changed in the future. For example, this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional
action or through other actions, including future proposed budgets, international trade agreements and other arrangements or proposals.
Additionally, there is a risk that the FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products,
potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. The extent to which a biosimilar, once approved,
will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological
products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. It is also possible
that payors will give reimbursement preference to biosimilars over reference biological products, even absent a determination of interchangeability. 

To
the extent that we do not receive any anticipated periods of regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates, or the FDA or foreign
regulatory authorities approve any biosimilar, interchangeable, or other competing products to our product candidates, it could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

If
our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest
and our business may be adversely affected. 

Our
current or future trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or descriptive or determined
to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop
using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. 

86 

During
trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections of our applications by the USPTO or in other foreign jurisdictions. Although
we would be given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO
and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications
and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks
may not survive such proceedings. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not
be able to compete effectively, and our business may be adversely affected. We may license our trademarks and trade names to third parties,
such as distributors. Although these license agreements may provide guidelines for how our trademarks and trade names may be used, a
breach of these agreements or misuse of our trademarks and tradenames by our licensees may jeopardize our rights in or diminish the goodwill
associated with our trademarks and trade names. 

Moreover,
any name we have proposed to use with our product candidate in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether we
have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. Similar requirements exist in Europe. The FDA typically conducts a review
of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA (or an equivalent
administrative body in a foreign jurisdiction) objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, it may be required to expend
significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws,
not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. Furthermore, in many countries, owning and maintaining
a trademark registration may not provide an adequate defense against a subsequent infringement claim asserted by the owner of a senior
trademark. At times, competitors or other third parties may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability
to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement
claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks
or trade names. If we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable,
or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we
could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks. 

Risks
Related to Government Regulation 

If
we fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, we could face substantial penalties and our
business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects will be materially harmed. 

Our
current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers, and others may expose us to broadly applicable
healthcare fraud and abuse, and other healthcare laws, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through
which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. The applicable federal,
state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: 

The
 federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting,
 receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly,
 in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation
 of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such
 as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

The
 federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the civil FCA, and the federal Civil Monetary Penalties
 Law, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or
 fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material
 to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. 

87 

The
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA ), which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully
 executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false
 or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of,
 any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), willfully obstructing a criminal investigation
 of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact
 or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare
 benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. 

The
 U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biological
 products and medical devices. 

The
 federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under
 the ACA and its implementing regulations, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological products and medical
 supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions)
 to report annually to the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS information related to payments or other
 transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other
 healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and
 investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. 

Analogous
 state and foreign anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare
 items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor;
 state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines
 and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers
 to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing
 expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; and state and local laws requiring the
 registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 

If
we or our operations are found to be in violation of any federal or state healthcare law, or any other governmental laws or regulations
that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, monetary
fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government
contracts, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight
if we become subject to corporate integrity agreements or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance, contractual damages,
reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could
materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other healthcare
providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to
significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including but not limited to, exclusions from participation in U.S. federal
or state healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our business. 

Although
an effective compliance program can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot
be entirely eliminated. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with such laws may prove costly. Any action against us for violation
of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s
attention from the operation of our business. 

88 

If
the government or third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage, reimbursement and payment rates for our product candidates, or
if health maintenance organizations or long-term care facilities choose to use therapies that are less expensive or considered a better
value, our revenue and prospects for profitability will be limited. 

In
both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our products will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement
from third-party payors or placement on approved product formularies. Such third-party payors include government health programs such
as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon
clinical and economic standards that disfavor new therapeutic products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are
already available or subsequently become available, even if our products are alone in a class. Third-party payors establish reimbursement
levels. Therefore, even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or
maintain a market share sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our or their investments. If reimbursement is not available, or
is available only to limited levels, our product candidates may be competitively disadvantaged, and we may not be able to successfully
commercialize our product candidates. Alternatively, securing favorable reimbursement terms may require us to compromise pricing and
prevent us from realizing an adequate margin over cost. Our failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement
of our products, or failure to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing may negatively impact our revenue. Additionally,
coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Therefore, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement
status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

There
is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved therapeutics. Marketing approvals,
pricing, and reimbursement for new therapeutic products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly
change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries
require approval of the sale price of a therapeutic before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after
marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription biopharmaceutical pricing remains subject to
continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product
in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time
periods, which may negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing
limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain
marketing approval. Our ability to commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement
for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors. 

89 

A
significant trend within the healthcare industry is cost containment, both in the United States and elsewhere. Third-party payors, whether
foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs,
including use of formularies. Exclusion of a product from a formulary or other restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the
patient population and beyond. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products, typically
on the basis of unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or fewer side effects, as well as the
overall cost of the therapy. Certain third-party payors are requiring that companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list
prices, are using preferred drug lists to leverage greater discounts in competitive classes, are disregarding therapeutic differentiators
within classes, are challenging the prices charged for therapeutics, and are negotiating price concessions based on performance goals.
In addition, third-party payors are increasingly requiring higher levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies,
benchmarking against other therapies, seeking performance-based discounts, and challenging the prices charged. We cannot be sure that
coverage will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate.
If payors subject our product candidates to maximum payment amounts or impose limitations that make it difficult to obtain reimbursement,
providers may choose to use therapies which are less expensive when compared to our product candidates. Additionally, if payors require
high copayments, beneficiaries may seek alternative therapies. We may need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate
the cost-effectiveness of any products to the satisfaction of hospitals, other target customers and their third-party payors. Such studies
might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our products might not ultimately
be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels
sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. 

In
addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore,
coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement
will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement
for our products or product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United
States or international markets, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock
price and prospects. 

There
may also be delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved therapeutics, and coverage may be more limited than the
indications for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Such delays have made it increasingly
common for manufacturers to provide newly approved drugs to patients experiencing coverage delays or disruption at no cost for a limited
period in order to ensure that patients are able to access the drug. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any
therapeutic will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale, and
distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new therapeutics, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may
only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary, by way of example, according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which
it is used. Reimbursement rates may also be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost products or may be incorporated
into existing payments for other services. 

An
inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for any of our product candidates for which
we obtain marketing approval could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize
products and our overall financial condition. 

We
are subject to new legislation, regulatory proposals and third-party payor initiatives that may increase our costs of compliance, and
adversely affect our ability to market our products, obtain collaborators, and raise capital. 

In
the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes
regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval
activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any products for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws,
as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional
downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved products. For example, the ACA was passed in March 2010 and substantially
changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical
industry. 

90 

There
have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally
titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act ), includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the
tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for
all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court
dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate 
was repealed by Congress. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order
that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive
order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare,
including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies
that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. In addition, on August
16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA into law, which among other things, extends
enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates
the donut hole under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket
cost through a newly established manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional
challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact
the ACA and our business. 

Other
legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA. For example, through the process created by the
Budget Control Act of 2011, there are automatic reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2 per fiscal year, which went into
effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect until 2032 unless additional Congressional
action is taken. 

In
addition, there have been a number of other legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the biopharmaceutical industry. For
instance, the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 imposes obligations on manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products related to product
tracking and tracing. Further, manufacturers have product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related
to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences of
death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such
that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 

Compliance
with the federal track and trace requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens. As
a result of these and other new proposals, we may determine to change our current manner of operation, provide additional benefits or
change our contract arrangements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations, stock price and prospects. 

There
has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription
drugs and biological products. Such scrutiny has resulted in presidential executive orders, congressional inquiries and proposed and
enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship
between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. 

91 

At
the federal level, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 eliminated the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, previously set at 100 of
a drug s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, effective January 1, 2024. In July
2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, Promoting Competition in the American Economy, with multiple
provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug
pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative
actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA directs the Secretary of HHS to establish a Drug Price Negotiation
Program (the Program) to lower prices for certain single-source prescription drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Parts B and D,
based on criteria established under the IRA. Under the Program, the Secretary of HHS will publish a list of selected drugs, 
and will then negotiate maximum fair prices MFP with their manufacturers. Beginning in 2026, the first year of the Program,
the number will be limited to 10 Part D drugs and biologics. By 2029, and in subsequent years thereafter, the number will increase to
20 drugs and biologics covered under Part D and Part B. Agreements between HHS and manufacturers will remain in place until a drug or
biologic is no longer considered a selected drug for negotiation purposes. Manufacturers who do not comply with the negotiated
prices set under the Program will be subject to an excise tax based on a percentage of total sales of a selected drug up
to 95 and the potential of civil monetary penalties. Further, the IRA imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize
price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023. On August 15, 2024,
HHS announced the agreed-upon price of the first 10 drugs that were subject to price negotiations, although the Medicare drug price negotiation
program is currently subject to legal challenges. HHS will select up to fifteen additional drugs covered under Part D for negotiation
in 2025. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.
HHS has and will continue to issue and update guidance as these programs are implemented. Further, in response to the Biden administration s
October 2022 executive order, on February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the CMS Innovation
Center which will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve quality of care. It is
unclear whether the models will be utilized in any health reform measures in the future. Additionally, on December 7, 2023, the Biden
administration announced an initiative to control the price of prescription drugs through the use of march-in rights under the Bayh-Dole
Act. On December 8, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published for comment a Draft Interagency Guidance Framework
for Considering the Exercise of March-In Rights which for the first time includes the price of a product as one factor an agency can
use when deciding to exercise march-in rights. While march-in rights have not previously been exercised, it is uncertain if that practice
will continue under the new framework. 

At
the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and
biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and
marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk
purchasing. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA approved Florida s Section 804 Importation Program SIP proposal
to import certain drugs from Canada for specific state healthcare programs. It is unclear how this program will be implemented, including
which drugs will be chosen, and whether it will be subject to legal challenges in the United States or Canada. Other states have also
submitted SIP proposals that are pending review by the FDA. 

Any
new laws or regulations, including those that may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, could have
a material adverse effect on customers for our products, if approved, and, accordingly, on our results of operations. 

92 

We
expect that the ACA, as well as other federal and state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, particularly in
light of the U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, increased regulatory
burdens and operating costs, decreased net revenue from our biopharmaceutical products, decreased potential returns from our development
efforts, and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from
Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation
of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from commercializing our products and being able to generate
revenue, and we could be prevented from or significantly delayed in achieving profitability. 

We
are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as import and export control laws, customs
laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal
penalties, and other consequences, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price
and prospects. 

Our
operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and other anti-corruption
laws that apply in countries where we do business. The FCPA and these other anti- corruption laws generally prohibit us and our employees
and intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving, directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper
payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other
illegal activities of our personnel or intermediaries, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities. 

We
are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including applicable import and export control
regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations,
collectively referred to as the trade control laws. 

We
can provide no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws or
other legal requirements, including trade control laws. If we are not in compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws or trade control
laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses,
which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. In addition,
we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject
or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. An investigation of any potential violations of anti-corruption
laws or trade control laws by U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, financial
condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

We
and the third parties with whom we work are subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, and rules, contractual
obligations, industry standards, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Our (or the third parties with
whom we work) actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation
(including class claims) and mass arbitration demands; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm;
loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse business consequences. 

In
the ordinary course of our business, we collect, receive, process, generate, use, transfer, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose
of, transmit and store (collectively, process personal data and other sensitive information, including proprietary and
confidential business data, intellectual property, trade secrets, data we collect about trial participants in connection with clinical
trials and sensitive third-party data. Our data processing activities subject us to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such
as various laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual requirements
and other obligations relating to data privacy and security. 

93 

In
the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data breach
notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), and other
similar laws (e.g., wiretapping laws). For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical
Health Act HITECH ), imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually
identifiable protected health information. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states including California, Virginia, Colorado,
Connecticut, and Utah have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including
providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable,
such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities,
such as targeted advertising, profiling, and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability
to provide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including
sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance.
For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 CCPA applies to the personal data of consumers, business representatives
and employees who are California residents, and requires covered businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor
requests of such individuals to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for fines of up to 7,500 per intentional violation
and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. The CCPA and other comprehensive
U.S. state privacy laws exempt some data processed in the context of clinical trials, but these developments may further complicate compliance
efforts, and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us, the third parties with whom we work and our customers. Similar laws are
being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels, and we expect more states to pass similar laws
in the future. We may also be subject to new U.S. state laws governing the privacy of consumer health data. For example, Washington s
My Health My Data Act MHMD broadly defines consumer health data, places restrictions on processing consumer health data
(including imposing stringent requirements for consents), provides consumers certain rights with respect to their health data, and creates
a private right of action to allow individuals to sue for violations of the law. Other states are considering and may adopt similar laws. 

Outside
the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards govern data privacy and security. For example, the
European Union s General Data Protection Regulation EU GDPR ), the United Kingdom s GDPR UK GDPR (collectively, GDPR ), and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection impose strict requirements for processing personal data.
For example, under the GDPR, companies may face temporary or definitive bans on data processing and other corrective actions; fines of
up to 20 million euros under the EU GDPR, 17.5 million pounds sterling under the UK GDPR or, in each case, 4 of annual global revenue,
whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection
organizations authorized at law to represent their interests. 

In
the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries.
Europe and other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal data to other countries.
In particular, the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the United
States and other countries whose privacy laws it generally believes are inadequate. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent
interpretations of their data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. 

Although
there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance
with law, such as the EEA standard contractual clauses, the UK s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, and the EU-U.S.
Data Privacy Framework and the UK extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify
compliance and participate in the Framework), these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can
satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. 

94 

If
there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal data from the EEA, the UK or other jurisdictions to the United States, or if the
requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption
or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate part of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions
(such as Europe) at significant expense, increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to
transfer data and work with partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of personal
data necessary to operate our business. Additionally, companies that transfer personal data out of the EEA and UK to other jurisdictions,
particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and activist groups. Some
European regulators have ordered certain companies to suspend or permanently cease certain transfers out of Europe for allegedly violating
the GDPR s cross-border data transfer limitations. 

In
addition to data privacy and security laws, we are contractually subject to industry standards adopted by industry groups and, we are,
or may become subject to such obligations in the future. We are also bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security,
and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. For example, certain privacy laws, such as the GDPR, and the CCPA,
require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their service providers. Additionally, some of our customer contracts
require us to host personal data locally. 

We
publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements regarding data privacy and security. If these policies, materials
or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be
subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences. 

Obligations
related to data privacy and security (and consumers data privacy expectations) are quickly changing, becoming increasingly stringent,
and creating uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be
inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires significant resources, which
may necessitate changes to our services, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process
personal data on our behalf. 

We
may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our data privacy and security obligations. Moreover,
despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties with whom we work may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively
impact our business operations. If we or the third parties with whom we work fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply
with applicable data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to: government
enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar); litigation (including class-action claims)
and mass arbitration demands; additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; bans or restrictions on processing personal data; orders
to destroy or not use personal data; and imprisonment of company officials. In particular, plaintiffs have become increasingly more active
in bringing privacy-related claims against companies, including class claims and mass arbitration demands. Some of these claims allow
for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for monumental statutory damages,
depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,
business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of customers; interruptions or stoppages in our business operations
(including, as relevant, clinical trials); inability to process personal data or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability
to develop or commercialize our products; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse publicity; or substantial
changes to our business model or operations. 

95 

Violations
of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could subject us to fines, penalties or other costs that
could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. 

We
are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory
procedures, the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
Our operations involve the controlled production, storage, use and disposal of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals
and biological materials such as infectious agents and various radioactive compounds. We would incur substantial costs as a result of
violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements in connection with our operations or property, including fines, penalties
and other sanctions, investigation and cleanup costs and third-party claims. Although we generally contract with third parties for the
disposal of hazardous materials and wastes from our operations, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials.
In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages,
and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties,
as well as our curtailment of the use of these materials or even shutting down our facilities and operations. 

Although
we maintain workers compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting
from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. While we maintain
insurance covering our manufacturing facility only, and not our other facilities, for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that
may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials, such insurance coverage may
not be sufficient to cover extraordinary or unanticipated events at our manufacturing facility. 

Risks
Related to Our Business and Operations 

We
are highly dependent on our key personnel, including our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. If we are not successful in
attracting, motivating and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. 

Our
ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract, motivate
and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our management and particularly
on the services of our personnel, including Thomas Zindrick, J.D., our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. We believe that
their drug discovery and development experience and overall biopharmaceutical company management experience, would be difficult to replace.
Any of our executive officers could leave our employment at any time, as all of our employees are at-will employees. We
currently do not have key person insurance on any of our employees. The loss of the services of our key personnel and any
of our other executive officers, key employees, and scientific and medical advisors, and our inability to find suitable replacements,
could result in delays in our research and development objectives and harm our business. 

96 

Recruiting
and retaining qualified employees, consultants and advisors for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also
be critical to our success. We conduct our operations at our facilities in Southern California, a region that is home to many other biopharmaceutical
companies and many academic and research institutions. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high.
We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies and academic institutions for skilled individuals. In addition, failure to succeed in preclinical studies, clinical trials
or applications for marketing approval may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit,
or the loss of services of certain executives, key employees, consultants or advisors, may impede the progress of our research, development
and commercialization objectives and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock
price and prospects. 

To
induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock option grants that
vest over time. The value to employees of these equity grants that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock
price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Although
we have employee agreements with our key employees, these agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees
could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. We do not maintain key person insurance policies on the
lives of all of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees. 

We
will need to continue to expand the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could
disrupt our operations. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had [25 full-time and part-time employees, including 16 employees engaged in research and development and manufacturing].
As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing,
financial and other personnel. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including: 

identifying,
 recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees; 

managing
 our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical, FDA and comparable foreign regulatory review process for our
 product candidates, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and 

improving
 our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. 

Our
future financial performance and our ability to commercialize Olvi-Vec, V2ACT Immunotherapy and any other product candidates we develop
will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate
amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. 

We
currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors
and consultants to provide certain services. The services include substantially all aspects of clinical trial management and manufacturing.
We cannot assure you that the services of independent organizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on
a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced
activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may
be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain marketing approval of Olvi-Vec and our other product candidates
or otherwise advance our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent
outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all. 

97 

If
we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring qualified new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and
contractors, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize Olvi-Vec and our other
product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals. 

If
we engage in future acquisitions or strategic partnerships, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause
us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities, and subject us to other risks. 

We
may evaluate various acquisitions and strategic partnerships, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, intellectual property
rights, technologies, or businesses. Any potential acquisition or strategic partnership may entail numerous risks, including: 

increased
 operating expenses and cash requirements; 

the
 assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities; 

the
 issuance of our equity securities; 

assimilation
 of operations, intellectual property and products of an acquired company, including difficulties associated with integrating new
 personnel; 

the
 diversion of our management s attention from our existing product programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger
 or acquisition; 

retention
 of key employees, the loss of key personnel, and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships; 

risks
 and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party, their regulatory
 compliance status, and their existing products or product candidates and marketing approvals; and 

our
 inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition
 or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs. 

In
addition, if we undertake acquisitions, we may issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses
and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense. Moreover, we may not be able to locate suitable
acquisition opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be
important to the development of our business. Any of the foregoing may materially harm our business, financial condition, results of
operations, stock price and prospects. 

98 

Unfavorable
market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock
price and prospects. 

Our
results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A
severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including a reduced ability to raise additional
capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in
supply disruption. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic
climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business. 

Public
health crises such as pandemics could materially and adversely affect our preclinical studies and clinical trials, business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

As
a result of pandemics and related governmental orders and other public health guidance measures, we have and may in the future experience
disruptions that could materially and adversely impact our preclinical studies, clinical trials, business, financial condition and results
of operations. Potential disruptions might include but are not limited to: 

delays
 or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials; 

delays
 or difficulties in initiating or expanding clinical trials, including delays or difficulties with clinical site initiation and recruiting
 clinical site investigators and clinical site staff; 

increased
 rates of patients withdrawing from our clinical trials following enrollment as a result of contracting health conditions or being
 forced to quarantine; 

interruption
 of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring and efficacy, safety and translational data collection,
 processing and analyses, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal, state or local governments, employers and
 others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits, which may impact the collection and integrity of subject data and clinical
 study endpoints; 

diversion
 of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial
 sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials; 

delays
 or disruptions in preclinical experiments and studies due to restrictions of on-site staff and unforeseen circumstances at CROs and
 vendors; 

interruption
 or delays in the operations of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies; 

interruption
 of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our product candidates from third-party providers due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns
 or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems; 

limitations
 on employee or other resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials and preclinical work, including
 because of sickness of employees or their families, the desire of employees to avoid travel or contact with large groups of people,
 an increased reliance on working from home, school closures or mass transit disruptions; 

changes
 in regulations which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected
 costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether; and 

delays
 in necessary interactions with regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee
 resources or forced furlough of government or contractor personnel. 

99 

Future
developments in these and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our clinical trials, business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

If
our information technology systems or those third parties with whom we work or our data are or were compromised, we could experience
adverse consequences resulting from such compromise, including but not limited to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines
and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and
other adverse consequences. 

In
the ordinary course of our business, we and the third parties with whom we work process proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data,
including personal data, de-identified health-related data, intellectual property, proprietary business information and trade secrets
(collectively, sensitive information ). 

Cyber-attacks,
malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of our sensitive information and information technology systems, and those of the third parties with whom we work. Such
threats are prevalent and continue to rise, are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety of sources, including
traditional computer hackers, threat actors, hacktivists, organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such
as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation states, and nation-state-supported actors. Some actors now engage and are expected
to continue to engage in cyber-attacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction
with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major conflicts, we and the third parties with whom we
work may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including retaliatory cyber-attacks, that could materially disrupt our
systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services. 

We
and the third parties with whom we work are subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering
attacks (including through deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, and phishing attacks), malicious
code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks,
credential stuffing attacks, credential harvesting, personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software
bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications
failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, attacks enhanced or facilitated by artificial intelligence, and other similar threats. In particular,
severe ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, ability to
provide our products or services, disruption of clinical trials, loss of sensitive data and income, reputational harm, and diversion
of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such
payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. 

It
may be difficult and/or costly to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate a security incident. Our efforts to do so may
not be successful. Actions taken by us or the third parties with whom we work to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate
a security incident could result in outages, data losses, and disruptions of our business. Threat actors may also gain access to other
networks and systems after a compromise of our networks and systems. 

Remote
work has become more common and has increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as more of our employees utilize
network connections, computers, and devices outside our premises or network, including working at home, while in transit and in public
locations. 

Future
or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities,
as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities systems and technologies.
Furthermore, we may discover security issues that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it
may be difficult to integrate companies into our information technology environment and security program. 

100 

We
rely on third parties to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts, including, without
limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center facilities, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery
to customers, and other functions. Our ability to monitor these third parties information security practices is limited, and these
third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If the third parties with whom we work experience a security
incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. While we may be entitled to damages if the third parties with
whom we work fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages,
or we may be unable to recover such award. In addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot
guarantee that third parties infrastructure in our supply chain or that of the third parties with whom we work have not been compromised. 

While
we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will
be effective. We take steps designed to detect, mitigate and remediate vulnerabilities in our information technology systems (such as
our hardware and/or software, including that of third parties with whom we work). We may not, however, detect and remediate all such
vulnerabilities including on a timely basis. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures and patches
designed to address identified vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could be exploited and result in a security incident. 

Any
of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that could result in unauthorized,
unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to our sensitive
information or our information technology systems or those of the third parties with whom we work. A security incident or other interruption
could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties with whom we work) to provide our products. Our current security measures may be
insufficient to prevent or deter such incidents or interruptions. We may expend significant resources or modify our business activities
(including our clinical trial activities) to try to protect against security incidents. Certain data privacy and security obligations
may require us to implement and maintain specific security measures, industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our
information technology systems and sensitive information. 

Applicable
data privacy and security obligations may require us, or we may voluntarily choose, to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected
individuals, customers, regulators, and investors, of security incidents, or to take other actions, such as providing credit monitoring
and identity theft protection services. Such disclosures and related actions can be costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply
with such applicable requirements could lead to adverse consequences. If we (or a third party with whom we work) experience a security
incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, such as government enforcement
actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight;
restrictions on processing sensitive information (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations;
negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions; diversion of management attention; interruptions in our operations (including
availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant consequences may prevent or cause customers
to stop using our products, deter new customers from using our products, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business. 

101 

Our
contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in
our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations.
We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out
of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or
that such coverage will pay future claims. 

In
addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information about us from public
sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to undermine
our competitive advantage or market position. 

We
face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and have
to limit the commercialization of any approved products and/or our product candidates. 

The
use of our product candidates in clinical trials, and the sale of any product for which we obtain regulatory approval, exposes us to
the risk of product liability claims. We face inherent risk of product liability related to the testing of our product candidates in
human clinical trials, including liability relating to the actions and negligence of our investigators, and will face an even greater
risk if we commercially sell any product candidates that we may develop. For example, we may be sued if any product candidate we develop
allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product
liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the
product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts.
Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our
products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit
commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless
of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: 

loss
 of revenue from decreased demand for our products and/or product candidates; 

impairment
 of our business reputation or financial stability; 

costs
 of related litigation; 

substantial
 monetary awards to patients or other claimants; 

diversion
 of management attention; 

withdrawal
 of clinical trial participants and potential termination of clinical trial sites or entire clinical programs; 

the
 inability to commercialize our product candidates; 

significant
 negative media attention; 

decreases
 in our stock price; 

initiation
 of investigations and enforcement actions by regulators; and 

102 

product
 recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions, including withdrawal of marketing approval. 

We
believe we have sufficient insurance coverage in place for our business operations. However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse
us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly
expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect
us against losses due to liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include clinical trials and the sale of commercial
products if we obtain FDA or comparable foreign regulatory approval for our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to
obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing, or at all. Failure to obtain and
retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop.
On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on therapeutics that had unanticipated side effects. A
successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed
our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash, and materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock
price and prospects. 

Our
employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, principal investigators, CMOs, or CROs may engage in misconduct
or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business. 

We
are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial
partners, principal investigators, CMOs or CROs could include intentional, reckless, negligent, or unintentional failures to comply with
FDA regulations, comply with applicable fraud and abuse laws, provide accurate information to the FDA, properly calculate pricing information
required by federal programs, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. This misconduct
could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result
in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter this type of misconduct,
and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses
or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such
laws or regulations. Moreover, it is possible for a whistleblower to pursue an FCA case against us even if the government considers the
claim unmeritorious and/or declines to intervene, which could require us to incur costs defending against such a claim. In addition,
we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such
actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have
a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects, including the imposition
of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation
in U.S. federal healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, imprisonment,
contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations. 

103 

We
have generated significant net operating loss NOL carryforwards and research and development tax credits, and our ability
to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits to reduce future tax payments may be limited
or restricted. 

We
have generated significant NOL carryforwards and research and development tax credits (R D credits) as a result of our incurrence
of losses and our conduct of research activities since inception. As of December 31, 2023, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards
of approximately 160.0 million and 134.0 million, respectively. We do not anticipate generating revenue from sales of products for
the foreseeable future, if ever, and we may never achieve profitability. Our U.S. federal NOL carryforwards generated in taxable years
beginning before January 1, 2018 can be carried forward to each of the 20 taxable years following the year of the loss. These NOL carryforwards
could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under current law, U.S. federal NOLs incurred in tax
years beginning after December 31, 2017, totaling 50.0 million, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the utilization of such U.S.
federal NOLs is limited. As of December 31, 2023, we also had federal and state R D credit carryforwards of 2.6 million and 2.0
million, respectively. Our U.S. federal R D credit carryforwards can be carried forward 20 taxable years. If not utilized in that
period, these R D credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under current
law, the California state R D credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized. 

Under
Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes
an ownership change, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and R D credits to offset
its post-change income and taxes, respectively, may be limited. For purposes of these rules, an ownership change generally
occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5 of a company s stock increase their ownership
by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. The application of these
rules could limit the amount of NOLs or R D credit carryforwards that we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or
tax liabilities. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited,
which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. For example, California recently imposed limits on the usability of
California state NOL carryforwards and certain state tax credits in tax years beginning after 2023 and before 2027. 

Our
NOL and R D credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by U.S. and state tax authorities. 

If
we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting our ability to produce accurate and timely financial
statements could be impaired. 

As
a public company, we operate in an increasingly demanding regulatory environment, which requires us to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, the regulations of the Nasdaq Capital Market, the rules and regulations of the SEC, expanded disclosure requirements, accelerated
reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue
to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and
place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Company responsibilities required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include
establishing corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective
internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. We are
continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our principal executive and financial officers. 

We
are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In order to develop, maintain, and improve the
effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended resources,
and anticipate that the process of building our accounting and financial functions and infrastructure will continue to require
significant resources, including professional fee, internal costs, and significant management oversight. For example, we expect that
we will need to implement new systems to enhance and streamline the management of our financial, accounting, human resources and
other functions. However, such systems will likely require us to complete many processes and procedures for the effective use of the
systems, which may result in substantial costs. Any disruptions or difficulties in implementing or using these systems could
adversely affect our controls and harm our business. Moreover, such disruption or difficulties could result in unanticipated costs
and diversion of management attention. 

Our
current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business.
Further, we may discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in
a material misstatement of our financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all
errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control
issues and instances of fraud will be detected. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able
to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business
and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be
subject to sanctions or investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), Nasdaq
or other regulatory authorities. 

These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of
simple error or mistake. For example, our directors or executive officers could inadvertently fail to disclose a new relationship or
arrangement causing us to fail to make a required related party transaction disclosure. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by
the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly,
because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Any failure
to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. 

104 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. 

We
are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).
We must design our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and
procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. We may discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could
result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent
or detect all errors and all fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be
detected. 

These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of
simple error or mistake. For example, our directors or executive officers could inadvertently fail to disclose a new relationship or

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

An
active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. 

Prior
to the closing of our IPO in January 2023, there was no public market for shares of our common stock. An active trading market for our
shares may not be sustained. You may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in shares of our common
stock is not active. As a result of these and other factors, you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock. Further, an
inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter
into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our shares of common stock as consideration. 

Our
operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may
cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline. 

We
expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating
results. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including: 

the
 timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research and development and commercialization activities relating to our current
 and any future product candidates, which will change from time to time; 

the
 total expenses we incur in connection with establishing, equipping, and operating our current and any future manufacturing facility(ies); 

105 

the
 cost of manufacturing our current and any future product candidates, which may vary depending on the FDA s and comparable foreign
 regulatory authorities guidelines and requirements, the quantity of production and the terms of any agreements with suppliers; 

results
 of preclinical studies and current and future clinical trials, or the addition or termination of future clinical trials or funding
 support by us, or future collaborators or licensing partners; 

our
 execution of any collaboration, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under existing
 or future arrangements or the termination or modification of any such existing or future arrangements; 

any
 intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition, interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved; 

additions
 and departures of key personnel; 

strategic
 decisions by us, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy; 

if
 any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, the terms of such approval and market acceptance and demand for such
 product candidates; 

regulatory
 developments affecting our product candidates; 

changes
 in accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; 

changes
 in the variables used as a basis for valuing these stock-based awards, resulting in changes in the magnitude of the expense that
 we must recognize; and 

potential
 unforeseen business disruptions that increase our costs or expenses. 

These
factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing
our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication
of our future performance. 

This
variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors
for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may
provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of
our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated
revenue and/or earnings guidance we may provide. 

The
market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers
of our common stock. 

The
market price of our common stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, widely, due to many factors, some of which may be beyond
our control. These factors include, without limitation: 

short
 squeezes 

106 

comments
 by securities analysts or other third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media; 

large
 stockholders exiting their position in our common stock or an increase or decrease in the short interest in our common stock; 

actual
 or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results; 

negative
 public perception of us, our competitors, or the biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries; and 

overall
 general market fluctuations. 

The
stock market in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that have been often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the issuer.
In particular, the trading prices for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been highly volatile, and we
note recent instances of extreme stock price run-ups followed by rapid price declines and stock price volatility seemingly unrelated
to company performance following a number of recent initial public offerings, particularly among companies with relatively smaller public
floats. For example, the daily closing market price for our common stock has varied significantly since the commencement of trading of
our common stock on Nasdaq on January 26, 2023, ranging between a high price of 38.00 on June 21, 2023, and a low price of 1.60 on
August 5, 2024. Since the closing of our IPO, we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations
that would explain such price volatility or trading volume. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of
our common stock. In particular, a large proportion of our common stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which
has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock, further influencing volatility in its market
price. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our common
stock to fluctuate, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively
affect the liquidity of our common stock. 

In
addition, if the trading volumes of our common shares are low, persons buying or selling in relatively small quantities may easily influence
prices of our common shares. This low volume of trades could also cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate greatly, with large
percentage changes in price occurring in any trading day session. Holders of our common shares may also not be able to readily liquidate
their investment or may be forced to sell at depressed prices due to low volume trading. A decline in the market price of our common
shares also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional shares of common shares or other securities and our ability to obtain
additional financing in the future. No assurance can be given that an active market in our common shares will develop or be sustained. 

The
market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including: 

results
 from, and any delays in, our clinical trials for Olvi-Vec, our preclinical studies and any other future clinical development programs; 

actual
 or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts; 

107 

commencement
 or termination of collaboration, licensing or similar arrangements for our development programs; 

announcements
 by our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments; 

failure
 or discontinuation of any of our development programs; 

our
 ability to commercialize Olvi-Vec and our other product candidates, if approved, inside and outside of the United States, either
 independently or working with third parties; 

our
 partners and collaborators ability to successfully commercialize their licensed product candidates; 

developments
 or setbacks related to drugs that are co-administered with any of our product candidates, such as cellular and targeted therapies; 

regulatory
 or legal developments in the United States and other countries; 

developments
 or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights; 

the
 recruitment or departure of key personnel; 

the
 level of expenses related to the development of Olvi-Vec and any other product candidate we may develop; 

changes
 in the competitive landscape in our industry, including results of clinical trials of existing and potential future products that
 compete with Olvi-Vec and our other product candidates; 

our
 ability to adequately support future growth; 

variations
 in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; 

future
 accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; 

announcements
 or expectations of additional financing efforts by us; 

sales
 of our common stock by us, our insiders or other stockholders; 

recommendations
 and changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, that cover our stock; 

changes
 in the structure of healthcare payment systems; 

market
 conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; 

general
 economic, political, and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the financial markets in the United States and abroad, including
 bank failures, global pandemics, the Russia/Ukraine conflict or the conflicts in the Middle East; and 

investors 
 general perception of us and our business. 

108 

These
and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate rapidly and substantially,
including any stock price run-up, regardless of our actual or expected operating performance and financial condition or prospects, which
may limit, prevent or make it difficult for prospective investors to assess the rapidly changing value of our common stock or to sell
their shares at or above the price paid for the shares and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. 

We
do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock. 

You
should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings
for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable
future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, which may never occur, as the only way
to realize any return on their investment. 

Our
principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant control over matters
subject to stockholder approval. 

Our
executive officers and directors, combined with our stockholders who own more than 5 of our outstanding capital stock, beneficially
own shares representing a significant percentage of our common stock. Therefore, these stockholders have the ability to influence us
through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example,
these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger,
sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for
our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. 

Sales
of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to
fall. 

Sales
of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in
the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. For
example, Aladar Szalay, Ph.D. and his affiliated entities have sold a substantial number of shares of our common stock since July 24,
2023, the lock-up agreement expiration date in connection with our IPO. 

In
addition, shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit
plans will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and Rule
144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). If these additional shares of common
stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. 

Future
sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result
in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. 

We
expect that we will need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations, including conducting clinical
trials, commercialization efforts, expanded research and development activities, and costs associated with operating a public company.
To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and
in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may
be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors
could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our common stock. 

109 

Pursuant
to our 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2022 Plan and the 2023 Inducement Plan (the Inducement Plan ), we
are authorized to grant equity awards to our employees, directors and consultants. Additionally, the number of shares of our common stock
reserved for issuance under our 2022 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2024 and continuing
through and including January 1, 2032, by 5 of the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding
calendar year, or a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors. In addition, pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year,
beginning on January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2032, by the lesser of (i) 1 of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding
on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, and (ii) 2,100,000 shares of common stock; provided that before the date of any such increase,
our board of directors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (i) and (ii). Unless our board
of directors elects not to increase the number of shares available for future grant each year, our stockholders may experience additional
dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall. 

We
are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth
companies and smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ).
For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company
reporting requirements, including being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required
unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations disclosure in this Quarterly Report, not being required to have our internal control over financial
reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure
obligations regarding executive compensation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions
from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute
payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these exemptions until the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth
anniversary of our IPO (i.e. December 31, 2028) or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. We will cease
to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period if certain earlier events occur, including if we become a
 large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, our annual gross revenues exceed 1.235 billion
or we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period. 

Under
the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards
apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act until the earlier of the date we
(i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided
in the JOBS Act. 

110 

We
are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company
even after we are no longer an emerging growth company, which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions available
to emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. We will be able to take advantage of these scaled
disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the
last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed
fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business
day of our second fiscal quarter. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some
investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock
price may be more volatile. 

Provisions
in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition
of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove
our current management. 

Provisions
in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may discourage,
delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions
in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing
to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our
board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts
by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our
board of directors. Among other things, these provisions: 

establish
 a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time; 

allow
 the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors; 

limit
 the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board; 

establish
 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of
 directors; 

require
 that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written
 consent; 

prohibit
 our stockholders from calling a special meeting of our stockholders; 

authorize
 our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a stockholder rights
 plan, or so-called poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively
 preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and 

require
 the approval of the holders of at least 66 2/3 of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal
 certain provisions of our charter or bylaws. 

111 

Moreover,
because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which
prohibits a person who owns 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years
after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination
is approved in a prescribed manner. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change
in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including
transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that
investors are willing to pay for our stock. 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the U.S. federal district
courts are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders 
ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum
for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: 

any
 derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; 

any
 action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; 

any
 action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
 or our amended and restated bylaws; and 

any
 action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. 

This
provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the
Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state
and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the
threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
further provides that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting
a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are
facially valid and several state trial courts have enforced such provisions and required that suits asserting Securities Act claims be
filed in federal court, there is no guarantee that courts of appeal will affirm the enforceability of such provisions and a stockholder
may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we
would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and the
provisions may be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. 

If
a court were to find the exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable
in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with litigating Securities Act claims in state court, or both
state and federal court, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Further, this exclusive
forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with
us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. 

112 

General
Risk Factors 

We
incur significantly increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial
time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices. 

As
a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject
to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly, and
current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently
adopted by the SEC and Nasdaq to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, impose significant requirements on public companies,
including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance
practices. Further, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act was
enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require
the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as say on pay and proxy access. Emerging growth companies
and smaller reporting companies are exempted from certain of these requirements, but we may be required to implement these requirements
sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the
current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations,
which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. 

We
expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and
to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from
other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The
increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business
or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and
more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain
the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these
requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve
on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. 

113 

Future
changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse and unexpected revenue fluctuations and adversely affect our
reported results of operations. 

Future
changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse, unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported financial position
or results of operations. Financial accounting standards in the United States are constantly under review and new pronouncements and
varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency in the past and are expected to occur again in the future. As
a result, we may be required to make changes in our accounting policies. Those changes could affect our financial condition and results
of operations or the way in which such financial condition and results of operations are reported. We intend to invest resources to comply
with evolving standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management
time and attention from business activities to compliance activities. See the section titled Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Recent Accounting Pronouncements. 

Changes
in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash
flow, financial condition or results of operations. 

New
income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely
affect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could
be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, the Tax Act, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
Act, and the IRA enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities with respect to such legislation may affect us, and certain aspects thereof could be repealed or modified in future legislation.
In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates,
the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses
under the Tax Act or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in
significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense. 

If
securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price
of our stock could decline. 

The
trading market for our common stock will rely, in part, on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about
us or our business. We may never obtain research coverage by industry or financial analysts. If no or few analysts commence coverage
of us, the trading price of our stock would likely decrease. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts covering
our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to
cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which, in turn, could cause our stock price to decline. 

Our
failure to meet Nasdaq s continued listing requirements could result in a delisting of our common stock. 

If
we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing
bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the
price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of
a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our
common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock
from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with the listing requirements of Nasdaq. 

We
could be subject to securities class action litigation. 

In
the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against public companies following declines in the market prices
of their securities. This risk is especially relevant for biopharmaceutical companies, which have experienced significant stock price
volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention
and our resources, which could harm our business.
