 Item 2. Management s Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as previously filed with the Commission. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations, and beliefs, involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. Overview Monogram Technologies Inc. (the Company , Monogram , we, us, our was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 21, 2016, as Monogram Arthroplasty Inc. On March 27, 2017, the Company changed its name to Monogram Orthopedics Inc. On May 15, 2024, the Company changed its name from Monogram Orthopedics Inc. to Monogram Technologies Inc. Monogram Technologies is an AI-driven robotics company focused on improving human health, with an initial focus on orthopedic surgery. The Company is developing a product solution architecture to enable patient optimized orthopedic implants at scale by combining 3D printing, advanced machine vision, AI and next generation robotics. The Company has a robot prototype that can autonomously execute optimized paths for high precision insertion of implants in simulated cadaveric surgeries. Monogram intends to produce and market robotic surgical equipment and related software, orthopaedic implants, tissue ablation tools, navigation consumables, and other miscellaneous instrumentation necessary for reconstructive joint replacement procedures. The Company has obtained 510(k) clearances for certain implants but has not yet made 510(k) premarket notification submissions or obtained 510(k) premarket clearances for any of robotic products. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) premarket clearance is required to market our robotic products, and the Company cannot estimate the timing, or assure our ability, to obtain such clearances. Recent Developments FDA Update The Company announced on August 8, 2024, that on July 19, 2024, it had submitted a 510(k) premarket filing to the FDA for the Company s semi-active version of the mB s TKA System. The FDA has completed its Administrative and Substantive reviews of this 510(k) filing. On September 30, 2024, the Company received an Additional Information Request (AIR) from the FDA. According to the 2nd Quarter FY2023 MDUFA V Performance Report, approximately 68 of 510(k)s submitted in FY2022 received AIR requests from the FDA during their first review cycle. Monogram s 510(K) submission was over 28,000 pages, so receipt of the AIR from the FDA aligned with management s expectations. On October 16, 2024, the Company held a teleconference with the FDA to address the clarification questions in the AIR, which management found constructive. The FDA has recommended an issue-specific submission (q submission) to discuss the Company s planned approach for responding to the AIR. The Company anticipates holding the issue-specific meeting with the FDA by December 2024 pending FDA availability which could delay timing. The Company has 180 days from receiving the AIR to respond with the requested information. If the FDA accepts the current planned approach, the Company believes it could address the AIR within the allotted period; however, this timeline could change based on the outcome of the December issue-specific meeting wherein the FDA may request clinical data or comment on the planned approach. Closing of Series D Preferred Stock Offering As previously reported in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024 filed with the Commission on August 8, 2024, on July 9, 2024, the Company commenced a best efforts offering of up to 5,790,479 units, with each unit consisting of (a) one share of our 8.00 Series D Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock (the Series D Preferred Stock and (b) one Common Stock Purchase Warrant to purchase one share of our common stock, 0.001 par value per share (the Common Stock at an exercise price of 3.375 per share, for a total of 5,790,479 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 5,790,479 shares of our Common Stock (and shares of Common Stock underlying shares of Series D Preferred Stock, PIK dividends on Series D Preferred Stock, and all such warrants), which we refer to as the Series D Preferred Stock Offering .

 On October 2, 2024, the Company announced the closing of its Series D Preferred Stock Offering. In total, the Company received gross proceeds of approximately 13 million from the sale of units consisting of 5,789,479 shares of the Company s Series D Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,789,479 shares of the Company s Common Stock in connection with the Series D Preferred Stock Offering. At the Market Common Stock Offering On July 22, 2024, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. to sell shares of our Common Stock from time to time through an at-the-market equity offering program under which B. Riley Securities, Inc. will act as our sales agent (the Sales Agent ). Under the Sales Agreement, we may issue and sell from time-to-time shares of our Common Stock for aggregate proceeds of up to 25,000,000. Each time the Company wishes to issue and sell Common Stock under the Sales Agreement, the Company will notify the Sales Agent of the number or dollar value of shares to be issued, the time period during which such sales are requested to be made, any limitation on the number of shares that may be sold in one day, any minimum price below which sales may not be made and other sales parameters deemed appropriate. Once the Company has so instructed the Sales Agent, unless the Sales Agent declines to accept the terms of the notice, the Sales Agent has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell such shares up to the amount specified on such terms. We have no obligation to sell any shares of our Common Stock under the Sales Agreement, and we may suspend solicitation and offers under the Sales Agreement for any reason in our sole discretion. We agreed to pay the Sales Agent a commission equal to up to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from the sales of shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement or such lower amount as we and the Sales Agent may agree. Any shares of our Common Stock sold under the Sales Agreement will be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279927) and the base prospectus included therein, originally filed with the Commission on June 4, 2024 and declared effective by the SEC on June 14, 2024. A prospectus supplement relating to the offering of shares of our Common Stock under the Sales Agreement was filed with the SEC on July 22, 2024. We refer to this offering herein as the At The Market Common Stock Offering . As of November 12, 2024, the Company had sold 1,592,023 shares of Common Stock under the Sales Agreement, for gross proceeds of 4,274,008. General Market Update The Company continues to see a significant and growing market opportunity for an active cutting robotic system that does not utilize haptic controls. Haptic controls may describe haptic control schemes such as admittance control, impedance control, or hybrid control, i.e., configurations where the device is not intended to move autonomously on its own. The Company believes the patent landscape for haptic control and the widespread adoption of products like Mako could be favorable for next-generation active cutting robots like Monogram s mB s TKA System, which is being designed to efficiently resect bone without utilizing haptic controls. Monogram has filed several patents around its active control scheme. Monogram is not aware of any widely accepted products where the robot efficiently resects bone with a saw on the market today other than Mako. Results of Operations for the Three Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenues The Company is currently focused on commercialization of its robotic products, including seeking 510(k) clearances from the FDA for those products. The Company did not make any sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. The Company does not anticipate additional sales before initiating a clinical study and obtaining the appropriate regulatory approvals.

The reduction in R D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was offset in part by an increase of 554,133 related to regulatory expenses as the Company prepared for its planned 510(k) submission. Marketing and advertising expenses increased by 1,806,716 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by the marketing campaign to support the Series D preferred Stock Offering which commenced in July 2024 and closed on October 2, 2024. Marketing and advertising expenses incurred for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024 decreased by 28 compared to the same period in 2023. The expenses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily related Company s marketing campaign for its Regulation A Tier 2 offering of its Common Stock (the Reg A Common Stock Offering that began during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and successfully culminated with a round closing in May of 2023. General and administrative expenses increased 3 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 11 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In both periods, the increases were primarily due to increases in insurance and regulatory compliance and consulting and professional fees, as described more fully below: Insurance and regulatory compliance expenses were higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 due to additional insurance and regulatory compliance activities required to list as a publicly traded company on NASDAQ, which occurred May 2023. Consulting and professional services expenses were higher during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the respective periods ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the Company s use of such services related to its offering of the Series D Preferred Stock Offering, increased legal and accounting expenses due to our increased regulatory reporting requirements as an Exchange Act reporting company (which we became in May 2023), and continued protection for the Company s intellectual property. 
 As a result of the foregoing, the Company s total operating expenses increased 37 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 7 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods ending September 30, 2023.

 Other Income The following table sets forth our other income for the periods indicated : 

Three Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change Change in fair value of warrant liability 2,646,399 (2,646,399) Interest income and other, net 112,621 114,973 (2,352) Total other income 112,621 2,761,372 (2,648,751) 

Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change Change in fair value of warrant liability 3,088,533 (3,088,533) Interest income and other, net 312,142 211,503 100,639 Total other income 312,142 3,300,037 (2,987,894) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a change in the fair value of warrant liability that resulted in a gain caused primarily by a decrease in the value of the Company s Common Stock used to estimate the fair value of certain warrants that included anti-dilution protections. Because of these protections, when the Company issued additional shares of its capital stock in connection with its ongoing capital raising efforts, the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of these warrants increased proportionally. During May and October 2023, these warrants were exercised by the holders, and as a result, no warrants with anti-dilution protections remain outstanding. The increase in interest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily the result of proceeds from the Company s Regulation A Common Stock Offering which were invested in a JP Morgan US Government Money Market Fund beginning in Q2 2023. Net Loss As a result of the foregoing factors, the Company had a net loss of 5,034,501 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 an 80 increase compared to a net loss of 995,660 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (which was driven primarily by the loss of the value of the warrant liability due to those warrants no longer being outstanding, which significantly offset operational losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, followed by increased marketing and advertising expenses related to the exercise Series D Preferred Stock Offering). Additionally, the Company had a net loss of 12,078,661 for nine months ended September 30, 2024 a 16 increase compared to 10,090,923 net loss for nine months ended September 30, 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024 the Company had approximately 16.6 million in cash on hand, largely resulting from proceeds received from the Company s various Common Stock and Preferred Stock offerings. The Company has recorded losses since inception and, as of September 30, 2024, had working capital of approximately 16.1 million and total stockholders equity of approximately 17.4 million. Since inception, the Company has been primarily capitalized through securities offerings. The Company plans to continue to try to raise additional capital through available financing options to the Company, including, but not limited to, registered or exempt equity and/or debt offerings, as well as straight or convertible debt financings, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these fundraising efforts. Absent additional capital, the Company may be forced to reduce expenses significantly and could become insolvent. To provide additional flexibility to the Company ahead of generating sufficient revenues to support operations: On July 19, 2023, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement with B. Riley Principal Capital, II LLC (the BRPC II ). Under the Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has the right to sell to BRPC II up to 20.0 million in shares of Common Stock (the Committed Equity Shares ), subject to certain limitations and the satisfaction of specified conditions in the Purchase Agreement, from time to time over the 24-month period commencing upon the initial satisfaction of the conditions to the BRPC II s purchase obligations set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including that the registration statement declared effective by the SEC on September 7, 2023. Sales of Common Stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and the timing of any sales, are solely at the Company s option, and it is under no obligation to sell any securities to BRPC II under the Purchase Agreement.

Table of Contents 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 292,726 shares of Common Stock to BRPC II for gross proceeds of 961,245 pursuant to this purchase obligation and therefore have approximately 19 million worth of our Common Stock that we may sell to BRPC II. Pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279927) and the base prospectus included therein, originally filed with the Commission on June 4, 2024 and declared effective by the SEC on June 14, 2024, we may also sell from time to time, in one or more offerings under this prospectus, debt securities, which may be senior or subordinated. We will issue any such senior debt securities under a senior indenture that we will enter into with a trustee to be named in the senior indenture. We will issue any such subordinated debt securities under a subordinated indenture, which we will enter into with a trustee to be named in the subordinated indenture. We have not issued any debt securities pursuant to this registration statement as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. For a description of the material provisions of the senior debt securities, the subordinated debt securities and the senior and subordinated indentures, please refer to the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-279927) and the base prospectus included therein, originally filed with the Commission on June 4, 2024 and declared effective by the SEC on June 14, 2024. Forms of the Senior Indenture and Subordinated Indenture are included as Exhibits 4.7 and 4.8, respectively, to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. On July 22, 2024, the Company commenced the At The Market Common Stock Offering (described more fully under Recent Developments in Item 2 of this report). As of November 12, 2024, the Company had sold 1,592,023 shares of Common Stock for total gross proceeds of 4,274,008 in this offering. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, sales in this offering are still ongoing. 
 The Company s unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is a business that has not yet generated profits, incurred a net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 12,078,661 and has an accumulated deficit of 63,708,186 as of September 30, 2024.The Company s ability to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months following the date the unaudited condensed financial statements were available to be issued is dependent upon its ability to produce revenues, raise capital, and/or obtain other financing sufficient to meet current and future obligations. Management has evaluated these conditions and believes its current cash balances, plus the additional capital available under the Purchase Agreement and At The Market Common Stock Offerings will be sufficient for the Company to satisfy its near-term capital needs and to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period. Issuances of Equity In two transactions during January and February 2024, ZB Capital Partners LLC, holder of a warrant exercisable for 547,944 shares of Common Stock, executed a cashless exercise of its warrant under which the Company issued the holder a total of 246,458 shares of Common Stock and retained the remaining shares as settlement of the 1.83 per share exercise price of the warrant. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 85,526 shares of its Common Stock to BRPC II for total proceeds, net of issuance costs, of 206,341. Pro-Dex Coverage Warrants On October 2, 2023, as consideration for Pro-Dex, Inc., a Colorado corporation Pro-Dex agreeing to exercise certain warrants exercisable for shares of the Company s Common Stock held by Pro-Dex in full, Monogram agreed to the following: If, (a) between October 2, 2023 and March 31, 2024; or (b) during the six month period between (i) April 1 and September 30 or (ii) October 1 and March 31 of each year thereafter, Monogram engages in or otherwise consummates an issuance of securities that results in Monogram receiving, or having the right to receive, gross proceeds of 5,000,000 or more during such period, then Monogram will issue Pro-Dex a warrant to be exercised in cash to purchase 5 (calculated after giving effect to such issuance to Pro-Dex) of the types, series and classes of securities issued during such period at a price equal to the total gross proceeds received over the such period divided by the number of securities issued during that same period on terms at least as favorable to Pro-Dex as the most favorable terms pursuant to which any such securities are acquired by any investor during such period (each, a Coverage Warrant ). Each Coverage Warrant will be issued to Pro-Dex within ten (10) business day after the last day of the applicable period, will have a term of six (6) months from the date of issuance and, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Pro-Dex in its sole and absolute discretion, will have other provisions consistent with the provisions of the Pro-Dex Warrants. Pro-Dex s rights in this regard will expire on December 31, 2025 and will apply to all warrant coverage issuances conducted from time to time, and at any time, by Monogram prior to that date.

 The gross proceeds received by the Company s in its Series D Preferred Stock and Common Stock offerings during the period from April 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024 exceeded 5.0 million. Therefore, at September 30, 2024, the Company was obligated to issue Pro-Dex a warrant exercisable into 298,122 shares of Series D Preferred Stock at an exercise price of 2.25 per share and a warrant exercisable into 85,705 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 2.67. Indebtedness As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 2.8 million in total liabilities, primarily comprised of vendor accounts payable of 1.5 million, accrued liabilities of 0.9 million and lease liabilities of 0.4 million. Commitments and Contingencies Under the Company s Exclusive License Agreement with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Mount Sinai ), the Company has an obligation to make certain payments to Mount Sinai as a result of reaching certain milestones in the development and sales of the product, and for significant events related to the Company. The Company is currently in discussions with Mount Sinai in regard to the payment obligation associated with a Significant Transaction following the Company becoming publicly traded on Nasdaq without undertaking a traditional initial public offering contemplated by that term. Under the licensing agreement, if at the time of completion of a Significant Transaction the Company has a valuation greater than 150,000,000, Mount Sinai will receive 1 of the fair market value of Company at the time of completion of the Significant Transaction. It is the Company s position that no Significant Transaction has occurred - but there is no guarantee the Company and Mount Sinai will come to a consensus on this point. If we cannot come to an agreement with Mount Sinai on this point, we may be forced into litigation - and even if we pursue litigation, it is possible that a court would not rule in our favor. If the Company is required to pay this amount, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operations. Cash Flows 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash used in operating activities (10,967,238) (10,430,384) Cash used in investing activities (47,809) (40,765) Cash provided by financing activities 13,991,161 14,877,980 Cash Used In Operating Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our 12,078,661 net loss, offset by various non-cash expenses including 942,528 related to stock-based compensation, 321,114 related to depreciation and amortization, and 85,749 related to other non-cash expenses. Additionally, the overall increase in our non-cash net working capital balance during this period increased the amount of cash used in operations of 237,968. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operations resulted primarily from our 10,090,923 net loss, offset by various non-cash expenses including 1,158,499 related to stock-based compensation, 307,293 related to depreciation and amortization, and 80,000 related to other non-cash expenses. Additionally, the overall decrease in our non-cash net working capital balance during this period decreased the amount of cash used in operations by 1,203,280 and was primarily due to increases in accounts payable resulting from the timing of payment of invoices. Cash Used in Investing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used in investing activities were comprised entirely of equipment purchases and remained relatively stable between the two periods. Cash Provided by Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 4,177,931 of net proceeds received from the sale of Common Stock under the Purchase Agreement and in the At the Market Common Stock Offering and 9,813,230 of net proceeds received from the Company s Series D Preferred Stock Offering.

Table of Contents 
 Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of 15.2 million received under the Reg A Common Stock Offering that concluded in May 2023, offset by 0.5 million of costs incurred in connection with the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. Impact of inflation While inflation may impact our capital and operating expenditures, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant. However, there can be no assurance that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future, including by heightened levels of inflation experienced globally as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent geopolitical conflict. Funding Requirements We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, including potential cash available to us under the Purchase Agreement, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for at least 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could expend capital resources sooner than we expect. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: Establishing and maintaining supply relationships with third parties that can provide adequate, in both amount and quality, products and services to support our development; Technological or manufacturing difficulties, design issues or other unforeseen matters; Addressing any competing technological and market developments; Seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals; and Attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues to support our cost structure, we expect to finance cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, commercial and other similar arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of stockholders will be, or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through commercial agreements, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies and/or future revenue streams, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our Common Stock. Also, our ability to raise necessary financing could be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, recent geopolitical events, and inflationary economic conditions and their effects on the market conditions. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market other products even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market these products ourselves or potentially discontinue operations. Summary of Accounting Principles Basis of Presentation The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and are consistent in all material respects with those applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 
 As permitted by SEC requirements for interim reporting, certain footnotes or other financial information have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements have been included. Revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year, therefore, the results and trends in these interim financial statements may not be representative of those for the full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Going Concern The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is a business that has not yet generated profits, incurred a net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 12,078,661 and has an accumulated deficit of 63,708,186 as of September 30, 2024. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months following the date the unaudited financial statements were available to be issued is dependent upon its ability to produce revenues, raise capital, and/or obtain other financing sufficient to meet current and future obligations. Management has evaluated these conditions and believes its current cash balances, plus the additional capital available under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement and the At The Market Agreement described in Note 4 to the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, will be sufficient for the Company to satisfy its near-term capital needs and to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period. Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company s most significant estimates relate to the fair value of the warrant liability, valuations of stock-based compensation, and the income tax valuation allowance. On a continual basis, management reviews its estimates, utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Emerging Growth Company As a Nasdaq listed public reporting company, we are required to publicly report on an ongoing basis as an emerging growth company (as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the JOBS Act) under the reporting rules set forth under the Exchange Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company , we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other Exchange Act reporting companies that are not emerging growth companies , including but not limited to: not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; taking advantage of extensions of time to comply with certain new or revised financial accounting standards; being permitted to comply with reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and being exempt from the requirement to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 We expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, beginning January 26, 2022, although if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of September 30th, before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31st.

Table of Contents 
 In summary, we are subject to ongoing public reporting requirements that are less rigorous than Exchange Act rules for companies that are not emerging growth companies and therefore, our shareholders could receive less information than they might expect to receive from more mature public companies. Item 3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to provide the information required under this item. Item 4. Controls And Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
