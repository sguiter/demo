 The initial borrowings under the Revolver were used to refinance borrowings outstanding under a prior credit agreement, and future borrowings under the Revolver may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, permitted acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to reduce borrowings under the Revolver. 
 The Amended Credit Agreement provides the option to increase the revolving credit facility or establish additional term loan facilities in an aggregate amount up to million, subject to customary conditions and the approval of any lender whose commitment would be increased, resulting in a maximum available principal amount under the Amended Credit Agreement of billion. 
 Fees and interest on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement vary based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement).

The fees and interest are subject to further adjustment based upon the Company's performance against specified key performance indicators related to certain environmental, social and/or governance goals of the Company. Based upon the performance of the Company against those key performance indicators in each Reference Year (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), certain adjustments to the otherwise applicable rates for interest, commitment fees and letter of credit fees will be made. These annual adjustments will not exceed an increase or decrease of in the aggregate for all key performance indicators in the case of the commitment fee rate or an increase or decrease of in the aggregate for all key performance indicators in the case of the Term SOFR borrowings, base rate borrowings or letter of credit fee rate.

Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of the financial covenants is calculated on a continuing operations basis and includes adjustments to add back non-cash goodwill impairment charges, share-based compensation costs, certain non-cash restructuring charges, pro forma historical EBITDA for businesses acquired, and other specified items in accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement.

 Interest rate swaps: The fair values of our interest rate swaps were derived using estimates to settle the interest rate swap agreements, which are based on the net present value of expected future cash flows on each leg of the swaps utilizing market-based inputs and a discount rate reflecting the risks involved. Refer to Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity for additional information on our interest rate swaps. 
 Foreign exchange forward contracts : The fair values of our foreign exchange forward contracts were derived using estimates to settle the foreign exchange forward contracts agreements, which are based on the net present value of expected future cash flows on each contract utilizing market-based inputs, including both forward and spot prices, and a discount rate reflecting the risks involved. Refer to Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity for additional information on our foreign exchange forward contracts.

 The carrying value is recorded in long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. We estimate the fair value of our investment using a scenario-based approach in the form of a hybrid analysis that consists of a Monte Carlo simulation model and an expected return analysis. The conclusion of value for our investment is based on the probability-weighted assessment of both scenarios. The hybrid analysis utilizes certain assumptions including the assumed holding period through the maturity date of ; the applicable waterfall distribution at the end of the expected holding period based on the rights and privileges of the various instruments; cash flow projections discounted at the risk-adjusted rate of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively; and the concluded equity volatility of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, all of which are Level 3 inputs. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the investment, which would result in different impacts to our consolidated balance sheet and comprehensive income. Actual results may differ from our estimates.

 Contingent consideration for business acquisitions: We estimate the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration using either a probability-weighted assessment of the specific financial performance targets being measured or a Monte Carlo simulation model, as appropriate. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements of our contingent consideration are our measures of the estimated payouts based on internally generated financial projections on a probability-weighted basis and a discount rate which was and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value of the contingent consideration is reassessed quarterly based on assumptions used in our latest projections and input provided by practice leaders and management. Any change in the fair value estimate is recorded to other gains, net in our consolidated statement of operations for that period. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liability, which would result in different impacts to our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations.

 COMPONENTS OF OPERATING RESULTS 
 Total Revenues 
 Revenues before Reimbursable Expenses 
 Revenues before reimbursable expenses are primarily generated by our employees who provide consulting and other professional services to our clients and are billable to our clients based on the number of hours worked, services provided, or achieved outcomes. We refer to these employees as our revenue-generating professionals. Revenues before reimbursable expenses are primarily driven by the number of revenue-generating professionals we employ as well as the total value, scope, and terms of the consulting contracts under which they provide services. We also engage independent contractors to supplement our revenue-generating professionals on client engagements as needed. 
 We generate our revenues before reimbursable expenses from providing professional services and software products under the following four types of billing arrangements: fixed-fee (including software license revenue); time-and-expense; performance-based; and software support, maintenance and subscriptions. 
 Fixed-fee (including software license revenue): In fixed-fee billing arrangements, we agree to a pre-established fee in exchange for a predetermined set of professional services. We set the fees based on our estimates of the costs and timing for completing the engagements. Fixed-fee arrangements also include software licenses for our revenue cycle management software and research administration and compliance software. 
 Time-and-expense: Under time-and-expense billing arrangements, we invoice our clients based on the number of hours worked by our revenue-generating professionals at agreed upon rates. Time-and-expense arrangements also include speaking engagements, conferences and publications purchased by our clients. 
 Performance-based: In performance-based billing arrangements, fees are tied to the attainment of contractually defined objectives. We enter into performance-based engagements in essentially two forms. First, we generally earn fees that are directly related to the savings formally acknowledged by the client as a result of adopting our recommendations for improving operational and cost effectiveness in the areas we review. Second, we earn a success fee when and if certain predefined outcomes occur. Often, performance-based fees supplement our fixed-fee or time-and-expense engagements. The level of performance-based fees earned may vary based on our clients risk sharing preferences and the mix of services we provide. 
 Software support, maintenance and subscriptions: Clients that have purchased one of our software licenses can pay an annual fee for software support and maintenance. We also generate subscription revenue from our cloud-based analytic tools and solutions. Software support, maintenance and subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the support or subscription period. These fees are generally billed in advance and included in deferred revenues until recognized. 
 Time-and-expense engagements do not provide us with a high degree of predictability as to performance in future periods. Unexpected changes in the demand for our services can result in significant variations in utilization and revenues and present a challenge to optimal hiring and staffing. Moreover, our clients typically retain us on an engagement-by-engagement basis, rather than under long-term recurring contracts. The volume of work performed for any particular client can vary widely from period to period. 
 Our quarterly results are impacted principally by the total value, scope, and terms of our client contracts, the number of our revenue-generating professionals who are available to work, our revenue-generating professionals' utilization rate, and the bill rates we charge our clients. Our utilization rate can be negatively affected by increased hiring because there is generally a transition period for new professionals that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rate. Our utilization rate can also be affected by seasonal variations in the demand for our services from our clients. For 
 23 

Table of Contents 

example, during the third and fourth quarters of the year, vacations taken by our clients can result in the deferral of activity on existing and new engagements, which would negatively affect our utilization rate. The number of business work days is also affected by the number of vacation days taken by our consultants and holidays in each quarter. We typically have fewer business work days available in the fourth quarter of the year, which can impact revenues during that period. 
 Reimbursable Expenses 
 Reimbursable expenses that are billed to clients, primarily relating to travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with client engagements, are included in total revenues. We manage our business on the basis of revenues before reimbursable expenses, which we believe is the most accurate reflection of our services because it eliminates the effect of reimbursable expenses that we bill to our clients at cost. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our most significant expenses are costs classified as direct costs. Direct costs primarily consist of compensation costs for our revenue-generating professionals, which includes salaries, performance bonuses, share-based compensation, signing and retention bonuses, payroll taxes and benefits. Direct costs also include fees paid to independent contractors that we retain to supplement our revenue-generating professionals, typically on an as-needed basis for specific client engagements, and technology costs, product and event costs, and commissions. Direct costs exclude amortization of intangible assets and software development costs and reimbursable expenses, both of which are separately presented in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs for our support personnel. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses are third-party professional fees, software licenses and data hosting expenses, rent and other office related expenses, sales and marketing related expenses, recruiting and training expenses, and practice administration and meetings expenses. 
 Other operating expenses include restructuring charges, other gains and losses, depreciation expense, and amortization expense related to internally developed software costs and intangible assets acquired in business combinations. 
 Segment Results 
 Segment operating income consists of the revenues generated by a segment, less operating expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated corporate expenses not allocated at the segment level include costs related to administrative functions that are performed in a centralized manner and are not attributable to a particular segment. These administrative function costs include corporate office support costs, office facility costs, costs related to accounting and finance, human resources, legal, marketing, information technology, and company-wide business development functions, and costs related to overall corporate management. 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 We also assess our results of operations using the following non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures differ from GAAP because they exclude a number of items required by GAAP, each discussed below. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flows, or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how we define our non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Our management uses the non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of our comparative operating performance, for example when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures when publicly providing our business outlook, for internal management purposes, and as a basis for evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Huron s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does and in comparing in a consistent manner Huron s current financial results with Huron s past financial results. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for the following items: 
 Amortization of intangible assets: We exclude the effect of amortization of intangible assets from the calculation of adjusted net income, as it is inconsistent in its amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. 
 24 

Table of Contents 

Restructuring charges: We have incurred charges due to restructuring various parts of our business. These restructuring charges have primarily consisted of costs associated with office space consolidations, including lease impairment charges and accelerated depreciation on lease-related property and equipment, and employee severance charges. We exclude the effect of the restructuring charges from our non-GAAP measures to permit comparability with periods that were not impacted by these items. We do not include normal, recurring, cash operating expenses in our restructuring charges. 
 2024 litigation settlement gain: In the second quarter of 2024, we settled a litigation matter in which Huron was the plaintiff for 15.0 million, on a pre-tax basis. This 15.0 million settlement gain was recorded as a component of other gains, net on our consolidated statement of operations. We have excluded from our non-GAAP measures 11.7 million, which is the value of the settlement gain that exceeds the third-party legal costs incurred during 2024 specific to this litigation matter, as this net gain is not indicative of the ongoing performance of our business. Of the 3.3 million third-party legal costs incurred for this matter in 2024, 2.7 million was incurred in the first quarter and 0.6 million was incurred in the second quarter. Our third-party legal expenses are recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on our statement of operations. Third-party legal costs incurred for this litigation matter during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 1.2 million and 2.2 million, respectively. 
 Other losses (gains), net: We exclude the effects of other losses and gains, which primarily relate to changes in the estimated fair value of our liabilities for contingent consideration related to business acquisitions and litigation settlement losses and gains, excluding the 2024 litigation settlement gain presented separately, to permit comparability with periods that are not impacted by these items. These items are recorded as a component of other gains, net on our consolidated statement of operations. 
 Transaction-related expenses : To permit comparability with prior periods, we exclude the impact of third-party advisory, legal, and accounting fees and other corporate costs incurred directly related to the evaluation and/or consummation of business acquisitions. 
 Foreign currency transaction losses (gains), net: We exclude the effect of foreign currency transaction losses and gains from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA because the amount of each loss or gain is significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 Tax effect of adjustments: The non-GAAP income tax adjustment reflects the incremental tax impact applicable to the non-GAAP adjustments. 
 Income tax expense, interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization: We exclude the effects of income tax expense, interest expense, net of interest income, and depreciation and amortization in the calculation of EBITDA, as these are customary exclusions as defined by the calculation of EBITDA to arrive at meaningful earnings from core operations excluding the effect of such items. We include, within the depreciation and amortization adjustment, the amortization of capitalized implementation costs of our ERP and other related software, which is included within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 Revenue-Generating Professionals 
 Our revenue-generating professionals consist of our full-time consultants who generate revenues based on the number of hours worked; full-time equivalents, which consists of coaches and their support staff within the culture and organizational excellence solution, consultants who work variable schedules as needed by clients, and full-time employees who provide software support and maintenance services to clients; and our Healthcare managed services employees who provide revenue cycle billing, collections, insurance verification and change integrity services to clients. 
 Utilization Rate 
 The utilization rate of our revenue-generating professionals is calculated by dividing the number of hours our billable consultants worked on client assignments during a period by the total available working hours for these billable consultants during the same period. Available working hours are determined by the standard hours worked by each billable consultant, adjusted for part-time hours, and U.S. standard work weeks. Available working hours exclude local country holidays and vacation days. Utilization rates are presented for our revenue-generating professionals who primarily bill on an hourly basis. We do not present utilization rates for our Managed Services professionals as most of the revenues generated by these employees are not billed on an hourly basis.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Executive Highlights 
 Highlights from the third quarter of 2024 include: 
 Revenues before reimbursable expenses increased 3.3 to 370.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 358.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Net income as a percentage of total revenues increased to 7.2 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 5.9 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses increased to 14.8 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 13.4 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Diluted EPS increased 33.6 to 1.47 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.10 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Adjusted diluted EPS increased 20.9 to 1.68 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.39 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 23.9 to 85.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 68.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Revenues before reimbursable expenses increased 11.9 million, or 3.3 , to 370.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 358.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses was driven by an increase in demand for Education's Consulting and Managed Services and Digital capabilities, as well as continued strength in demand for Healthcare's Digital capability, reflecting our focus on accelerating growth in our healthcare and education industries. These increases in demand were partially offset by a decrease in demand for Commercial's Consulting and Managed Services capability. 
 Revenues before reimbursable expenses within our Consulting and Managed Services capability were 214.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 214.7 million in the third quarter of 2023; and reflected strengthened demand in the Education segment, offset by a decrease in demand in our Commercial and Healthcare segments. The utilization rate within our Consulting capability decreased to 73.6 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 77.3 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Revenues before reimbursable expenses within our Digital capability increased 8.4 in the third quarter of 2024 to 155.5 million, compared to 143.5 million in the third quarter of 2023, and reflected strengthened demand in all of our segments. The utilization rate within our Digital capability increased to 77.2 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 75.4 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Our total number of revenue-generating professionals increased 10.4 to 5,896 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 5,341 as of September 30, 2023, as a result of hiring to support the overall increase in demand for our services. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services as employee compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. 
 Net income increased 5.6 million, or 26.2 , to 27.1 million, or 7.2 of total revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 21.5 million, or 5.9 of total revenues, for the same period last year. As a result of the increase in net income and a reduction in diluted shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases made under our share repurchase plan, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 increased 33.6 to 1.47, compared to 1.10 for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20.9 to 1.68 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.39 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.9 million, or 14.3 , to 54.9 million, or 14.8 of revenues before reimbursable expenses, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 48.0 million, or 13.4 of revenues before reimbursable expenses, for the same period last year. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2024 was 85.2 million, compared to 68.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to an increase in cash collections during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, as well as the cash received for the settlement of a legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff; partially offset by an increase in payments for salaries and related expenses for our revenue-generating professionals during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.

 Revenues before reimbursable expenses increased 11.9 million, or 3.3 , to 370.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 358.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The overall increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses was driven by an increase in demand for Education's Consulting and Managed Services and Digital capabilities, as well as continued strength in demand for Healthcare's Digital capability, reflecting our focus on accelerating growth in our healthcare and education industries. These increases in demand were partially offset by a decrease in demand for Commercial's Consulting and Managed Services capability. Additional information on our revenues before reimbursable expenses by segment follows. 
 Healthcare revenues before reimbursable expenses increased 4.0 million, or 2.2 , driven by continued strength in demand for our technology and analytics services within our Digital capability, as well as an increase in demand for our revenue cycle managed services solution within our Consulting and Managed services capability. These increases in demand were partially offset by decreases in demand for our financial advisory and strategy and innovation solutions within our Consulting and Managed Services capability. Revenues before reimbursable expenses in the third quarter of 2024 included 0.1 million of incremental revenues before reimbursable expenses from our acquisition of Roundtable Analytics completed in September 2023. 
 The number of revenue-generating professionals within our Healthcare segment grew 30.0 to 2,442 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1,878 as of September 30, 2023. 
 Education revenues before reimbursable expenses increased 10.0 million, or 9.0 , and includes 5.7 million of incremental revenues before reimbursable expenses from our acquisition of GG+A completed in March 2024. The increase in Education revenues before reimbursable expenses was also driven by strengthened demand for our technology and analytics services and software products within our Digital capability. 
 The number of revenue-generating professionals within our Education segment grew 3.9 to 1,250 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1,203 as of September 30, 2023. Our acquisition of GG+A in March 2024 added approximately 70 revenue-generating professionals. 
 Commercial revenues before reimbursable expenses decreased 2.1 million, or 3.1 , primarily due to decreases in demand for our financial advisory and strategy and innovation solutions within our Consulting and Managed Services capability, partially offset by an increase in demand for our technology and analytics services within our Digital capability. Revenues before reimbursable expenses in the third quarter of 2024 included 0.3 million of incremental revenues before reimbursable expenses from our acquisition of Vlamis completed in January 2024. 
 The number of revenue-generating professionals within our Commercial segment, the majority of which provide services across all of our industries, was 2,204 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 2,260 as of September 30, 2023.

Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased 5.5 million, or 1.7 , over the third quarter of 2023. 
 Operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses were as follows: Operating Expenses (in thousands, except amounts as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses) Three Months Ended September 30, 
 Increase / (Decrease) 2024 2023 Direct costs 247,849 67.0 244,774 68.3 3,075 Reimbursable expenses 8,135 2.2 9,497 2.7 (1,362) Selling, general and administrative expenses 70,375 19.0 64,361 18.0 6,014 Other gains, net (173) (14) (0.1) (159) Restructuring charges 3,137 0.8 5,402 1.5 (2,265) Depreciation and amortization 6,321 1.7 6,104 1.7 217 Total operating expenses 335,644 90.7 330,124 92.2 5,520 
 Direct Costs 
 Direct costs increased 3.1 million, or 1.3 , to 247.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 244.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The 3.1 million increase primarily related to an 8.9 million increase in compensation costs for our revenue-generating professionals and a 1.0 million increase in technology costs, partially offset by a 7.0 million decrease in contractor expenses. The increase in compensation costs reflects our investment to grow our talented team to meet increased market demand and is primarily attributable to a 16.9 million increase in salaries and related expenses driven by increased headcount and annual salary increases that went into effect in the first quarter of 2024; partially offset by a 4.5 million decrease in performance bonus expense, a 2.2 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, and a 1.3 million decrease in signing, retention and other bonus expense. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, direct costs decreased to 67.0 during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 68.3 during the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the decreases in contractor expenses, performance bonus expense and share-based compensation expense for our revenue-generating professionals; partially offset by the increase in salaries and related expenses for our revenue-generating professionals, as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses. 
 Reimbursable Expenses 
 Reimbursable expenses are billed to clients at cost and primarily relate to travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with client engagements. These expenses are also included in total revenues. We manage our business on the basis of revenues before reimbursable expenses, which we believe is the most accurate reflection of our services because it eliminates the effect of reimbursable expenses that are also included as a component of operating expenses. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 6.0 million, or 9.3 , to 70.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 64.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The 6.0 million increase primarily related to a 3.8 million increase in compensation costs for our support personnel driven by a 3.3 million increase in deferred compensation expense attributable to the change in market value of our deferred compensation liability and a 3.1 million increase in salaries and related expenses; partially offset by a 1.3 million decrease in share-based compensation expense and a 1.2 million decrease in performance bonus expense. The increase in deferred compensation expense is offset by an increase in the gain recognized for the change in the market value of investments that are used to fund our deferred compensation liability and recognized in other income (expense), net. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2.3 million for non-payroll costs driven by a 1.3 million increase in software and data hosting expense, a 0.7 million increase in bad debt expense, and a 0.6 million increase in research expense; partially offset by a 1.3 million decrease in legal expenses. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 19.0 during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 18.0 during the third quarter of 2023, which was primarily driven by the increase in deferred compensation expense attributable to the change in market value of our deferred compensation liability, as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses. 
 Other Gains, Net 
 Other gains, net totaled 0.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to less than 0.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The other gains, net in both the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023 primarily related to remeasurement gains to decrease the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities related to business combinations. 
 See Note 10 Fair Value of Financial Instruments within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.

Restructuring Charges 
 Restructuring charges for the third quarter of 2024 were 3.1 million, compared to 5.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The 3.1 million restructuring charge recognized in the third quarter of 2024 included 1.3 million of severance-related expenses; a 1.2 million non-cash impairment charge on the right-of-use operating lease asset and fixed assets for a portion of our New York, New York office space that we exited during the third quarter of 2024; and 0.6 million of rent and related expenses, net of sublease income, for previously vacated office spaces. 
 The 5.4 million of restructuring charges recognized in the third quarter of 2023 included a 3.5 million non-cash impairment charge on the right-of-use operating lease asset and fixed assets for our office space in Lexington, Massachusetts that we exited during the third quarter of 2023; 1.2 million of severance-related expenses; and 0.7 million of rent and related expenses, net of sublease income, for previously vacated office spaces. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 0.2 million, or 3.6 , to 6.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 6.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The 0.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to an increase in amortization of internally developed software, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets. 
 Operating Income 
 Operating income increased 5.1 million, or 13.7 , to 42.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 37.3 million in the third quarter of 2023.

Unallocated corporate expenses increased 3.7 million, or 8.6 , primarily due to increases in compensation costs for our support personnel and software and data hosting expenses; partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses. The increase in compensation costs for our support personnel was primarily driven by an increase in deferred compensation expense attributable to the change in market value of our deferred compensation liability and an increase in headcount and annual salary increases that went into effect in the first quarter of 2024; partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Interest expense, net of interest income increased 1.8 million to 6.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 5.0 million in the third quarter of 2023, which was primarily attributable to higher levels of borrowing and higher interest rates under our Amended Credit Facility during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below and Note 7 Financing Arrangements within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our Amended Credit Facility. 
 Other income (expense), net increased 2.9 million to income of 1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 from expense of 1.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in other income, net includes a 3.5 million increase in the gain recognized for the market value of our investments that are used to fund our deferred compensation liability. During the third quarter of 2024 we recognized a 2.2 million gain for the market value of our deferred compensation investments compared to a 1.3 million loss recognized in the third quarter of 2023.

 Income Tax Expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate was 27.8 as we recognized income tax expense of 10.4 million on income of 37.6 million. The effective tax rate of 27.8 was less favorable than the statutory rate, inclusive of state income taxes, of 26.1 , primarily due to certain nondeductible expense items. These unfavorable items were partially offset by a tax benefit related to non-taxable gains on our investments used to fund our deferred compensation liability. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our effective tax rate was 31.2 as we recognized income tax expense of 9.8 million on income of 31.3 million. The effective tax rate of 31.2 was less favorable than the statutory rate, inclusive of state income taxes, of 26.6 , primarily due to tax expense related to nondeductible losses on our investments used to fund our deferred compensation liability and certain nondeductible expense items. 
 Net Income and Earnings per Share 
 Net income increased 5.6 million, or 26.2 , to 27.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 21.5 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 1.47 from 1.10 for the third quarter of 2023, driven by the increase in net income and a reduction in diluted shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases made under our share repurchase plan. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA increased 8.3 million to 50.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 42.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increases in Healthcare and Education segment operating income, excluding segment depreciation and amortization; a decrease in corporate restructuring charges; and a decrease in unallocated corporate expenses, excluding the impact of the change in the market value of our deferred compensation liability. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.9 million to 54.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 48.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increases in Education, Healthcare and Commercial operating income, excluding the impact of segment depreciation and amortization and segment restructuring charges. 
 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share 
 Adjusted net income increased 3.9 million, or 14.3 , to 31.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 27.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. As a result of the increase in adjusted net income as well as a reduction in diluted shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases made under our share repurchase plan, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to 1.68 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.39 for the third quarter of 2023.

 Revenues before reimbursable expenses increased 74.8 million, or 7.3 , to 1.10 billion for the first nine months of 2024 from 1.02 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The overall increase in revenues before reimbursable expenses reflects continued strength in demand for both our Consulting and Managed Services capability and Digital capability within Healthcare and Education, and reflects our focus on accelerating growth in our healthcare and education industries. These increases in demand were partially offset by a decrease in demand for Commercial's Digital and Consulting and Managed Services capabilities. Additional information on our revenues before reimbursable expense by segment follows. 
 Healthcare revenues before reimbursable expenses increased 52.0 million, or 10.4 , driven by continued strength in demand for our technology and analytics services within our Digital capability and our performance improvement, strategy and innovation and culture and organizational excellence solutions within our Consulting and Managed Services capability. These increases in demand were partially offset by a decrease in demand for our financial advisory solution within our Consulting and Managed services capability. Revenues before reimbursable expenses in the first nine months of 2024 included 0.6 million of incremental revenues before reimbursable expenses from our acquisition of Roundtable Analytics completed in September 2023.

 The number of revenue-generating professionals within our Education segment grew 3.9 to 1,250 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1,203 as of September 30, 2023. Our acquisition of GG+A in March 2024 added approximately 70 revenue-generating professionals. 
 Commercial revenues before reimbursable expenses decreased 6.7 million, or 3.4 , primarily due to decreases in demand for our strategy and innovation solution within our Consulting and Managed Services capability and our technology and analytics services within our Digital capability, partially offset by an increase in demand for our financial advisory solutions within our Consulting and Managed Services capability. Revenues before reimbursable expenses in the first nine months of 2024 included 0.4 million of incremental revenues before reimbursable expenses from our acquisition of Vlamis completed in January 2024.

Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses for the first nine months of 2024 increased 47.5 million, or 5.0 , over the first nine months of 2023. 
 Operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses were as follows: Operating Expenses (in thousands, except amounts as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses) Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 Increase / (Decrease) 2024 2023 Direct costs 749,757 68.3 708,355 69.3 41,402 Reimbursable expenses 25,146 2.3 26,242 2.6 (1,096) Selling, general and administrative expenses 214,485 19.5 190,857 18.7 23,628 Other gains, net (14,522) (1.3) (202) (14,320) Restructuring charges 7,530 0.7 9,385 0.9 (1,855) Depreciation and amortization 18,326 1.7 18,621 1.8 (295) Total operating expenses 1,000,722 91.2 953,258 93.2 47,464 
 Direct Costs 
 Direct costs increased 41.4 million, or 5.8 , to 749.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 from 708.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. The 41.4 million increase primarily related to a 52.4 million increase in compensation costs for our revenue-generating professionals and a 3.1 million increase in technology costs, partially offset by a 13.0 million decrease in contractor expenses. The 52.4 million increase in compensation costs reflects our investment to grow our talented team to meet increased market demand and is primarily attributable to a 58.1 million increase in salaries and related expenses driven by increased headcount and annual salary increases that went into effect in the first quarter of 2024; partially offset by a 2.8 million decrease in performance bonus expense and a 2.5 million decrease in signing, retention and other bonus expense. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, direct costs decreased to 68.3 during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 69.3 during the first nine months of 2023, primarily attributable to the decrease in contractor expenses and performance bonus expense for our revenue-generating professionals; partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses for our revenue-generating professionals, as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses. 
 Reimbursable Expenses 
 Reimbursable expenses are billed to clients at cost and primarily relate to travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with client engagements. These expenses are also included in total revenues. We manage our business on the basis of revenues before reimbursable expenses, which we believe is the most accurate reflection of our services because it eliminates the effect of reimbursable expenses that are also included as a component of operating expenses. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 23.6 million, or 12.4 , to 214.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 190.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. The 23.6 million increase primarily related to a 15.0 million increase in non-payroll costs, driven by a 3.5 million increase in software and data hosting expenses, a 3.4 million increase in practice administration and meetings expenses, a 3.0 million increase in bad debt expense, and a 2.6 million increase in legal expenses. The increase in legal expenses is driven by professional fees for a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff as well as professional fees for acquisition activity. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8.8 million due to an increase in compensation costs for our support personnel driven by a 10.1 million increase in salaries and related expenses and a 3.2 million increase in deferred compensation expense attributable to the change in market value of our deferred compensation liability, partially offset by a 2.5 million decrease in performance bonus expense and a 1.1 million decrease in share-based compensation expense. The increase in deferred compensation expense is offset by an increase in the gain recognized for the change in the market value of investments that are used to fund our deferred compensation liability and recognized in other income (expense), net. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 19.5 during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 18.7 during the first nine months of 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to the increases in salaries and related expenses for our support personnel and deferred compensation expense attributable to the change in market value of our deferred compensation liability, as percentages of revenues before reimbursable expenses. 
 Other Gains, Net 
 Other gains, net totaled 14.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 0.2 million in the first nine months of 2023. The 14.5 million of other gains, net in the first nine months of 2024 primarily consisted of a pre-tax 15.0 million litigation settlement gain for a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff. The 0.2 million of other gains, net in the first nine months of 2023 primarily consisted of remeasurement gains to decrease the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities related to business combinations.

 Restructuring Charges 
 Restructuring charges for the first nine months of 2024 were 7.5 million, compared to 9.4 million for the first nine months of 2023.

 The 9.4 million of restructuring charges incurred in the first nine months of 2023 included 3.5 million and 1.9 million of non-cash impairment charges on the right-of-use operating lease assets and fixed assets for our office spaces in Lexington, Massachusetts and Hillsboro, Oregon, respectively, which we exited in the first nine months of 2023; 2.2 million of severance-related expenses; 1.3 million of rent and related expenses, net of sublease income, for previously vacated office spaces; 0.3 million related to the abandonment of a capitalized software development project; and 0.2 million related to non-cash lease impairment charges driven by updated sublease assumptions for our previously vacated office spaces. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 0.3 million, or 1.6 , to 18.3 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 18.6 million for the first nine months of 2023. The 0.3 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by an increase in amortization of internally developed software. 
 Operating Income 
 Operating income increased 26.3 million, or 27.5 , to 121.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 95.5 million in the first nine months of 2023.

The increases in compensation costs for our revenue-generating professionals and support personnel were primarily driven by an increase in headcount and annual salary increases that went into effect in the first quarter of 2024 and an increase in performance bonus expense for our revenue-generating professionals; partially offset by a decrease in signing, retention and other bonus expense for our revenue-generating professionals. Healthcare operating margin increased to 26.6 from 25.6 primarily due to the decrease in contractor expenses; partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses for our revenue-generating professionals, as a percentage of revenues before reimbursable expenses.

 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Interest expense, net of interest income increased 4.7 million to 19.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 15.1 million in the first nine months of 2023, which was primarily attributable to higher levels of borrowing and higher interest rates under our Amended Credit Facility during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below and Note 7 Financing Arrangements within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our senior secured credit facility.

 Income Tax Expense 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate was 22.9 as we recognized income tax expense of 24.6 million on income of 107.2 million. The effective tax rate of 22.9 was more favorable than the statutory rate, inclusive of state income taxes, of 26.1 , primarily due to a discrete tax benefit for share-based compensation awards that vested during the first quarter of 2024 and a tax benefit related to non-taxable gains on our investments used to fund our deferred compensation liability. These favorable items were partially offset by certain nondeductible expense items. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our effective tax rate was 27.4 as we recognized income tax expense of 22.5 million on income of 82.1 million. The effective tax rate of 27.4 was less favorable than the statutory rate, inclusive of state income taxes, of 26.6 , primarily due to certain nondeductible expense items.

Net income for the first nine months of 2024 includes the 11.1 million litigation settlement gain, net of tax, recognized in the second quarter of 2024 related to a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff. Diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 4.43 compared to 3.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the increase in net income and a reduction in diluted shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases made under our share repurchase plan. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA increased 29.6 million to 146.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 116.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increases in Healthcare and Education operating income, excluding segment depreciation and amortization, as well as the pre-tax 15.0 million litigation settlement gain recognized in the second quarter of 2024 for a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff; partially offset by the increase in unallocated corporate expenses, excluding the impact of the change in the market value of our deferred compensation liability.

 Operating Activities 
 Our operating assets and liabilities consist primarily of receivables from billed and unbilled services, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued payroll and related benefits, operating lease obligations and deferred revenues. The volume of services rendered and the related billings and timing of collections on those billings, as well as payments of our accounts payable and salaries, bonuses, and related benefits to employees affect these account balances. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for software and other information technology products to support our business and corporate infrastructure.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to an increase in cash collections in the first nine months of 2024, a 15 million litigation settlement received for a completed legal matter in which Huron was the plaintiff, and a decrease in payments for contractor expenses; partially offset by an increase in payments for salaries and related expenses for our revenue-generating professionals, an increase in the amount paid for annual performance bonuses in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023, and an increase in payments for selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing activities primarily consist of purchases of complementary businesses; purchases of property and equipment, primarily related to computers and related equipment for our employees and leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for office spaces; payments related to internally developed cloud-based software sold to our clients; and investments.

See Financing Arrangements below for additional information on our senior secured credit facility. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed 682.5 million and made repayments on our borrowings of 563.4 million. The borrowings and repayments during the first nine months of 2024 include the 275.0 million Term Loan proceeds which were used to repay borrowings under the Revolver in the first quarter of 2024. The net borrowings of 119.1 million were primarily used to fund our operations, including our annual performance bonus payments in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2024, we paid 104.6 million for the settlement of share repurchases and we reacquired 21.5 million of common stock as a result of tax withholdings upon vesting of share-based compensation. We also made payments of 1.4 million for debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan. These uses of cash for financing activities were partially offset by 1.6 million of cash received from stock option exercises in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 31.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we borrowed 292.0 million primarily to fund our operations, including our annual performance bonus payment in the first quarter of 2023, and made repayments on our borrowings of 224.0 million. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2023, we paid 88.9 million for the settlement of share repurchases and we reacquired 10.1 million of common stock as a result of tax withholdings upon vesting of share-based compensation. We also made deferred acquisition payments of 1.5 million to the sellers of certain businesses we acquired. These payments were primarily the result of achieving specified financial performance targets in accordance with the related purchase agreements. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 In November 2020, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program permitting us to repurchase up to 50 million of our common stock through December 31, 2021.The share repurchase program has been subsequently extended and increased, most recently in the second quarter of 2024. The current authorization extends the share repurchase program through December 31, 2025 with a repurchase amount of 500 million, of which 82.7 million remains available as of September 30, 2024. The amount and timing of repurchases under the share repurchase program were and will continue to be determined by management and depend on a variety of factors, including the trading price of our common stock, capacity under our credit facility, general market and business conditions, and applicable legal requirements. 
 Financing Arrangements 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 443.1 million outstanding under our Amended Credit Agreement, as discussed below. 
 The Company has a 600 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolver and a 275 million senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan ), subject to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 15, 2022 (as amended, the Amended Credit Agreement ), both of which fully mature on November 15, 2027. The Term Loan was established in February 2024 with the execution of Amendment No. 2 to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Term Loan is subject to scheduled quarterly amortization payments of 3.4 million which began June 30, 2024 and continue through the maturity date of November 15, 2027, at which time the outstanding principal balance and all accrued interest will be due. 
 Fees and interest on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement vary based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). At our option, these borrowings will bear interest at one, three or six month Term SOFR or, in the case of the Revolver, an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Revolver will fluctuate between 1.125 per annum and 1.875 per annum, in the case of Term SOFR borrowings, or between 0.125 per annum and 0.875 per annum, in the case of base rate loans, based upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio at such time. The applicable margin for the outstanding principal under the Term Loan will range between 1.625 per annum and 2.375 per annum based upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio at such time. The fees and interest are subject to further adjustment based upon the Company's performance against specified key performance indicators related to certain environmental, social and governance goals of the Company. Based upon the performance of the Company against those key performance indicators in each Reference Year (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), certain adjustments to the otherwise applicable rates for interest, commitment fees and letter of credit fees will be made. These annual adjustments will not exceed an increase or decrease of 0.01 in the aggregate for all key performance indicators in the case of the commitment fee rate or an increase or decrease of 0.05 in the aggregate for all key performance indicators in the case of the Term SOFR borrowings, base rate borrowings or letter of credit fee rate. 
 Amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Agreement may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. We are required to prepay the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement in certain circumstances, including upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). In addition, we have the right to permanently reduce or terminate the unused portion of the commitments provided under the Amended Credit Agreement at any time. 
 The Amended Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties; affirmative and negative covenants, which include limitations on liens, investments, additional indebtedness, and restricted payments; and two quarterly financial covenants as follows: (i) a maximum 
 39 

Table of Contents 

Consolidated Leverage Ratio (defined as the ratio of debt to consolidated EBITDA) of 3.75 to 1.00; however the maximum permitted Consolidated Leverage Ratio will increase to 4.25 to 1.00 upon the occurrence of a Qualified Acquisition (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), and (ii) a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to interest) of 3.00 to 1.00. Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of the financial covenants is calculated on a continuing operations basis and includes adjustments to add back non-cash goodwill impairment charges, share-based compensation costs, certain non-cash restructuring charges, pro forma historical EBITDA for businesses acquired, and other specified items in accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement. For purposes of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, total debt is on a gross basis and is not netted against our cash balances. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. Our Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 1.91 to 1.00, compared to 1.59 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2023. Our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 9.90 to 1.00, compared to 10.85 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2023. 
 The Amended Credit Agreement contains restricted payment provisions, including a potential limit on the amount of dividends we may pay. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, if our Consolidated Leverage Ratio is greater than 3.50, the amount of dividends and other Restricted Payments (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) we may pay is limited to an amount up to 50 million. 
 Borrowings outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled 443.1 million and 324.0 million, respectively. Of the 443.1 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024, 175.0 million was outstanding under the Revolver and 268.1 million was outstanding under the Term Loan. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan at December 31, 2023. These borrowings carried a weighted average interest rate of 4.9 at September 30, 2024 and 4.2 at December 31, 2023, including the impact of the interest rate swaps described in Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 The borrowing capacity under the Revolver is reduced by any outstanding borrowings under the Revolver and outstanding letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 0.6 million, which are used as security deposits for our office facilities. As of September 30, 2024, the unused borrowing capacity under the Revolver was 424.4 million. 
 Refer to Note 7 Financing Arrangements for additional information on our senior secured credit facility within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Future Financing Needs 
 Our primary financing need is to fund our long-term growth. Our growth strategy is to expand our service offerings, which may require investments in new hires, acquisitions of complementary businesses, possible expansion into other geographic areas, and related capital expenditures. 
 We believe our internally generated liquidity, together with our available cash, and the borrowing capacity available under our senior secured credit facility will be adequate to support our current financing needs and long-term growth strategy. Our ability to secure additional financing in the future, if needed, will depend on several factors, including our future profitability, the quality of our accounts receivable and unbilled services, our relative levels of debt and equity, and the overall condition of the credit markets. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 We are not a party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). We regularly review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate information relative to the current economic and business environment. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make assessments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those policies and estimates that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to impact our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies and estimates are important, we believe that there are five accounting policies and estimates that could be considered critical: revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts and unbilled services, business combinations, carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets, and accounting for income taxes. For a detailed discussion of these critical accounting policies, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the market value of our investments. We use certain derivative instruments to hedge a portion of the interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We have exposure to changes in interest rates associated with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. At our option, these borrowings bear interest at one, three or six month Term SOFR or, in the case of the Revolver, an alternate base rate. At September 30, 2024, we had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaling 443.1 million that carried a weighted average interest rate of 4.9 , including the impact of the interest rate swaps described below. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate would have a 1.4 million effect on our pretax income on an annualized basis, including the effect of the interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2023, we had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaling 324.0 million that carried a weighted average interest rate of 4.2 including the impact of the interest rate swaps described below. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate would have had a 0.7 million effect on our pretax income on an annualized basis, including the effect of the interest rate swaps. 
 We enter into forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the interest rate risks of our variable-rate borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, we receive from the counterparty interest on the notional amount based on one month Term SOFR and we pay to the counterparty a stated, fixed rate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate notional amount of our forward interest rate swap agreements was 300.0 million and 250.0 million, respectively. The outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of September 30, 2024 are scheduled to mature on a staggered basis through January 31, 2029. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar (USD) and the Indian Rupee (INR) related to our operations in India. We hedge a portion of our cash flow exposure related to our INR-denominated intercompany expenses by entering into non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate notional amounts of these contracts were INR 1,390.2 million, or 16.6 million, and INR 1,375.7 million, or 16.6 million, respectively, based on the exchange rates in effect as of each period end. The outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts as of September 30, 2024 are scheduled to mature monthly through August 31, 2025. 
 We use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the fair value of our foreign currency exchange rate hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the USD and INR would have an immaterial impact on the fair value of our hedge instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Market Risk 
 We have a 1.69 convertible debt investment in Shorelight Holdings, LLC, a privately-held company, which we account for as an available-for-sale debt security. As such, the investment is carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the investment was 57.0 million, with a total cost basis of 40.9 million. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of the investment was 68.0 million, with a total cost basis of 40.9 million. 
 We have a preferred stock investment in a privately-held hospital-at-home company, which we account for as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value using the measurement alternative. As such, the investment is carried at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the investment was 7.4 million with a total cost basis of 5.0 million. 
 We do not use derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. From time to time, we invest excess cash in short-term marketable securities. These investments principally consist of overnight sweep accounts. Due to the short maturity of these investments, we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure. Refer to Note 9 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative instruments.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are not a party to any litigation or legal proceeding or subject to any claim that, in the current opinion of management, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in legal proceedings, actual results could differ from current expected results. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 See Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K"), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024, for a complete description of the material risks we face. There have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors since the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
 Our Stock Ownership Participation Program and 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan permit the netting of common stock upon vesting of restricted stock awards to satisfy individual tax withholding requirements. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we reacquired 3,814 shares of common stock with a weighted average fair market value of 99.09 as a result of such tax withholdings. 
 In November 2020, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program permitting us to repurchase up to 50 million of our common stock through December 31, 2021. The share repurchase program has been subsequently extended and increased, most recently in the second quarter of 2024. The current authorization extends the share repurchase program through December 31, 2025 with a repurchase amount of 500 million, of which 82.7 million remains available as of September 30, 2024. The amount and timing of repurchases under the share repurchase program were and will continue to be determined by management and depend on a variety of factors, including the trading price of our common stock, capacity under our credit facility, general market and business conditions, and applicable legal requirements. 
 The following table provides information with respect to purchases we made of our common stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
