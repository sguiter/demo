 PeoplesBank operated full-service branches and limited purpose branches in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Following the Merger, Orrstown operated branches as of July 1, 2024. On August 5, 2024, Orrstown announced the Bank intends to close of its branches, including branches owned by the Bank, which the land and buildings were transferred to held-for-sale.

 Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total merger consideration is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of Codorus Valley based on their estimated fair value as of the closing of the Merger. The excess of the merger consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is allocated to goodwill. The Company recorded goodwill of million in connection with the Merger, which is not amortized for financial reporting purposes, but is subject to annual impairment testing.

 The following are descriptions of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of major categories of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Merger. The Company used independent valuation specialists to assist with the determination of fair values for certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities. 
 The Company acquired core deposit intangibles of million and customer relationship intangible assets associated with wealth and brokerage businesses totaling million from the Merger, both valued utilizing the income approach, which

years. 
 The Company increased the fair value of premises by million with a corresponding decrease to goodwill based upon updated independent market-based appraisals for buildings, land and land improvements. The fair value adjustments will depreciated based on the estimated useful life of years. 
 Pursuant to the Merger, the Company acquired operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities both with a fair value of million based on the income approach, which considered the lease contracts current rental rates, escalation terms and expiration periods. The Company also acquired a finance lease asset and liability with a fair value of thousand. At July 1, 2024, the Company recorded negative fair value adjustments of million and thousand to operating lease assets and finance lease assets, respectively, which are amortized over the remaining lease terms. 
 An adjustment of million was recorded to reflect the fair value of the time deposits assumed, which was determined using a discounted cash flow approach that utilized a discount rate equal to current market interest rates for instruments with similar terms and maturities. The fair value adjustment for time deposits will be amortized over the remaining maturities. 
 Subordinated notes and trust preferred debt were valued using a discounted cash flow approach, which applied a discount rate based upon other issuances with comparable terms. Fair value adjustments of million and million were recorded for the subordinated notes and trust preferred debt, respectively, which will be amortized over their remaining maturities. 
 The Company evaluated and classified the acquired loans between non-PCD or PCD. The PCD loans include loans which experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination. PCD loans included loans on nonaccrual status, past due 60 days or greater at any time since loan origination or having a risk rating of watch, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss based on the Company's internal risk rating system. For PCD loans, an ACL is recorded on day 1 and added to the fair value of the loan for its amortized cost. At day 1, a provision for credit loss is not recorded on PCD loans.

 On a quarterly basis, the Company conducts an impairment evaluation on AFS securities to determine whether the Company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery. If these situations apply, the guidance requires the Company to reduce the security's amortized cost basis down to its fair value through earnings. The Company also evaluates the unrealized losses on AFS securities to determine if a security's decline in fair value below its amortized cost basis is due to credit factors. The evaluation is based upon factors such as the creditworthiness of the underlying issuers, performance of the underlying collateral, if applicable, and the level of credit support in the security structure. Management also evaluates other factors and circumstances that may be indicative of a decline in the fair value of the security due to a credit factor. This includes, but is not limited to, an evaluation of the type of security, length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and near-term prospects of the issuer. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of the expected cash flows of the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. Under the CECL standard, if the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost, an ACL is recorded for the credit loss, which is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any additional amount of loss would be due to non-credit factors and is recorded in AOCI, net of taxes. If a credit loss is recognized in earnings, subsequent improvements to the expectation of collectability will be recognized through the ACL. If the fair value of the security increases above its amortized cost, the unrealized gain will be recorded in AOCI, net of taxes, on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 The Company did record an ACL on the AFS securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of these periods, the Company considers the unrealized losses on the AFS securities to be related to fluctuations in market conditions, primarily interest rates, and not reflective of deterioration in credit. In addition, the Company maintains that it has the intent and ability to hold these AFS securities until the amortized cost is recovered and it is more likely than not that any of AFS securities in an unrealized loss position would not be required to be sold. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unrealized losses were due to market uncertainty resulting from inflation and higher interest rates from the time of the security purchase. 
 U.S. Treasury Securities. The unrealized losses presented in the table above have been caused by an increase in rates from the time these securities were purchased. Management considers the full faith and credit of the U.S. government in determining whether declines in fair value are due to credit factors. 
 States and Political Subdivisions. The unrealized losses presented in the table above have been caused by a rise in interest rates from the time these securities were purchased. Management evaluates the financial performance of the issuers, including the investment rating, the state of the issuer of the security and other support in determining whether declines in fair value are due to credit factors. 
 GSE Residential CMOs, GSE Residential MBS and GSE Commercial MBS. The unrealized losses presented in the table above have been caused by a widening of spreads and a rise in interest rates from the time these securities were purchased. The contractual terms of these securities do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than its par value basis.

upon loan origination, unless the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance. 
 Home equity loans, including term loans and lines of credit, present a slightly higher risk to the Company than 1-4 family first liens, as these loans can be first or second liens on 1-4 family owner occupied residential property, but can have loan-to-value ratios of no greater than of the value of the real estate taken as collateral. The creditworthiness of the borrower is also considered, including credit scores and debt-to-income ratios. 
 Installment and other loans credit risk is mitigated through prudent underwriting standards, including evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower through credit scores and debt-to-income ratios and, if secured, the collateral value of the assets. These loans can be unsecured or secured by assets the value of which may depreciate quickly or may fluctuate and may present a greater risk to the Company than 1-4 family residential loans.

 In order to monitor ongoing risk associated with its loan portfolio and specific loans within the segments, management uses an internal grading system. The first several rating categories, representing the lowest risk to the Bank, are combined and given a Pass rating. Management generally follows regulatory definitions in assigning criticized ratings to loans, including "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful" or "Loss." The Special Mention category includes loans that have potential weaknesses that may, if not monitored or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the Bank's position at some future date. These assets pose elevated risk, but their weakness does not yet justify a more severe, or classified rating. Substandard loans are classified as they have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses that jeopardize liquidation of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Substandard loans include loans that management may determine to be either individually evaluated, referred to as "Substandard - Individually Evaluated Loan," or collectively evaluated, referred to as "Substandard Non-Individually Evaluated Loan." A Doubtful loan has a high probability of total or substantial loss, but because of specific pending events that may strengthen the asset, its classification as Loss is deferred. Loss loans are considered uncollectible, as the borrowers are often in bankruptcy, have suspended debt repayments, or have ceased business operations. Once a loan is classified as Loss, there is little prospect of collecting the loan s principal or interest and it is charged off. 
 The Company has a loan review policy and program, which is designed to identify and monitor risk in the lending function. The Management ERM Committee, comprised of executive officers, senior officers and loan department personnel, is charged with the oversight of overall credit quality and risk exposure of the Company's loan portfolio. This includes the monitoring of the lending activities of all Company personnel with respect to underwriting and processing new loans and the timely follow-up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality. A loan review program provides the Company with an independent review of the commercial loan portfolio on an ongoing basis. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the Pass categories unless a specific action, such as extended delinquencies, bankruptcy, repossession or death of the borrower occurs, which heightens awareness as to a possible credit event. 
 Internal loan reviews are completed annually on all commercial relationships with a committed loan balance in excess of million, which includes confirmation of risk rating by an independent credit officer. In addition, all commercial relationships greater than thousand rated Substandard, Doubtful or Loss are reviewed quarterly and corresponding risk ratings are reaffirmed by the Company's Problem Loan Committee, with subsequent reporting to the Management ERM Committee and the Board of Directors.

days past due will be individually evaluated for a specific reserve. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed to determine if the loan should be placed on nonaccrual status. Nonaccrual loans are, by definition, deemed to be individually evaluated under CECL. A specific reserve allocation for individually evaluated loans is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. For loans that are experiencing financial difficulty for extended periods of time, periodic updates on fair values are obtained, which may include updated appraisals. Updated fair values are incorporated into the analysis in the next reporting period. 
 Loan charge-offs, which may include partial charge-offs, are taken on an individually evaluated loan that is collateral dependent if the carrying balance of the loan exceeds the appraised value of the collateral, the loan has been placed on nonaccrual status or identified as uncollectible, and it is deemed to be a confirmed loss. Typically, loans with a charge-off or partial charge-off will continue to be individually evaluated. Generally, an individually evaluated loan with a partial charge-off may continue to have a specific reserve on it after the partial charge-off, if factors warrant. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s individually evaluated loans were measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral securing the loan, except for purchased auto loans on nonaccrual status and accruing loans accounted for as TDRs prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02. For real estate loans, collateral generally consists of commercial or residential real estate, but in the case of commercial and industrial loans, it could also consist of accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other business assets. Commercial and industrial loans may also have real estate collateral. 
 Updated appraisals are generally required every months for classified commercial loans, secured by commercial real estate, in excess of thousand. The as is" value provided in the appraisal is often used as the fair value of the collateral in determining impairment, unless circumstances, such as subsequent improvements, approvals, or other circumstances, dictate that another value than that provided by the appraiser is more appropriate. 
 Generally, commercial loans secured by real estate that are evaluated individually are measured at fair value using certified real estate appraisals that had been completed within the last months. Appraised values are discounted for estimated costs to sell the property and other selling considerations to arrive at the property s fair value. In those situations in which it is determined an updated appraisal is not required for loans individually evaluated for credit expected losses, fair values are based on either an existing appraisal or a DCF analysis as determined by management. The approaches are discussed below: 
 Existing appraisal if the existing appraisal provides a strong loan-to-value ratio (generally or lower) and, after consideration of market conditions and knowledge of the property and area, it is determined by the Credit Administration staff that there has not been a significant deterioration in the collateral value, the existing certified appraised value may be used. Discounts to the appraised value, as deemed appropriate for selling costs, are factored into the fair value. 
 Discounted cash flows in limited cases, DCF may be used on projects in which the collateral is liquidated to reduce the borrowings outstanding and is used to validate collateral values derived from other approaches. 
 Collateral on loans evaluated individually is not limited to real estate, and may consist of accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other business assets. Estimated fair values are determined based on borrowers financial statements, inventory ledgers, accounts receivable aging or appraisals from individuals with knowledge in the business. Stated balances are generally discounted for the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets. In determining fair value, liquidation discounts are applied to this collateral based on existing loan evaluation policies. 
 The Company distinguishes substandard loans for both loans individually and collectively evaluated, as it places less emphasis on a loan s classification, and increased reliance on whether the loan was performing in accordance with the contractual terms. A substandard classification does not automatically meet the definition of an individually evaluated loan. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard loans, does not have to exist in individual extensions of credit classified as substandard. As a result, the Company s methodology includes an evaluation of certain accruing commercial

 A loan is considered to be collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, substantially all individually evaluated loans were collateral-dependent and consisted primarily of commercial real estate, acquisition and development and residential mortgage loans, which were primarily secured by commercial or residential real estate.

 ASU 2022-02 requires that the Company evaluate, based on the accounting for loan modifications, whether the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the modification results in a more-than-insignificant direct change in the contractual cash flows and represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. This standard requires all loan modifications to be accounted for under the general loan modification guidance in ASC 310-20, Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs. 
 The Company may modify loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, interest rate reduction or an other-than-insignificant payment delay. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged off against the ACL. The Company may also provide multiple types of modifications on an individual loan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company extended modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that had a more-than-insignificant direct change in the contractual cash flows of the loan. In addition, the Company acquired three FDM loans from the Merger, which were modified previously during 2024. The Company did not extend modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that had a more-than-insignificant direct change in the contractual cash flows of the loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments, as the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not readily determinable. Lease agreements that contain non-lease components are generally accounted for as a single lease component, while variable costs, such as common area maintenance expenses and property taxes, are expensed as incurred. 
 Pursuant to the Merger, the Company acquired operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities both with a fair value of million. The Company also acquired a finance lease asset and liability with a fair value of thousand. At July 1, 2024, the Company recorded negative fair value adjustments of million and thousand to operating lease assets and finance lease assets, respectively, which are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The weighted average remaining lease term for the acquired operating leases is years.

interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge with a notional value of million, which was a pay-fixed hedge with a notional value for the purpose of hedging variable cash flows associated with the Company's borrowings. At December 31, 2023, the Company had interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges with a total notional value of million. At September 30, 2024, the Company had pay-float interest rate swap designated as a hedging instrument, for the purpose of hedging the variable cash flows of selected AFS securities or loans, mature with a total notional value of million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did enter into new interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. 
 Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings as the fair value changes. When a fair value hedge is discontinued, the hedged asset or liability is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value and the existing basis adjustment is amortized or accreted over the remaining life of the asset or liability. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had pay-fixed interest rate swaps on certain closed portfolio loans with our commercial clients with a total notional value of million. The commercial loans are scheduled to mature at various dates ranging from December 2026 to October 2054. The interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges and allow the Company to offer long-term fixed rate loans to commercial clients while mitigating the interest rate risk of a long-term asset by converting fixed rate interest payments to floating rate interest payments indexed to a synthetic U.S. SOFR rate. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not enter into new interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges. 
 The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements that allow its commercial loan customers to effectively convert a variable-rate commercial loan agreement to a fixed-rate commercial loan agreement. Under these agreements, the Company enters into a variable-rate loan agreement with a customer in addition to an interest rate swap agreement, which serves to effectively swap the customer s variable-rate loan into a fixed-rate loan. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate caps that allow its commercial loan customers to gain protection against significant interest rate increases and provide an upper limit, or cap, on the variable interest rate. The Company then enters into a corresponding swap or cap agreement with a third party in order to economically hedge its exposure through the customer agreement. The interest rate swaps and interest rate caps with both the customers and third parties are not designated as hedges and are marked through earnings. At September 30, 2024, the Company had customer and corresponding third-party broker interest rate derivatives not designated as a hedging instrument with an aggregate notional amount of million compared to million in notional amount of such derivative instruments at December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into and , respectively, new interest rate swaps with a commercial loan customer and recorded swap fee income of thousand and million, respectively. In addition, the Company acquired customer and corresponding third-party broker interest rate derivatives not designated as a hedging instrument with an aggregate notional value of million from the Merger. The Company entered into new interest rate swaps and recorded thousand in swap fee income during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and new interest rate swaps that resulted in swap fee income of thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Swap fee income is included in noninterest income in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash collateral of million and million with third parties for certain of these derivatives, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held cash collateral of thousand and million from a counterparty for these derivatives, respectively. 
 The Company also may enter into risk participation agreements with a financial institution counterparty for an interest rate derivative contract related to a loan in which the Company may be a participant or the agent bank. The risk participation agreement provides credit protection to the agent bank should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contracts with the agent bank. The Company manages its credit risk on the risk participation agreement by monitoring the creditworthiness of the borrower, which is based on the same credit review process as though the Company had entered into the derivative instruments directly with the borrower. The notional amount of such risk participation agreement reflects the

risk participation agreements with sold protection with a notional value of million and million, respectively, including risk participation agreements with sold protection with a notional value of million acquired from the Merger. In addition, the Company had risk participations with purchased protection with a notional value of million at September 30, 2024 compared to risk participations with purchased protection with a notional value of million at December 31, 2023. The Company did enter into any risk participation agreements with sold protection during the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into risk participation agreements with purchased protection. The Company did enter into any new risk participations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 As a part of its normal residential mortgage operations, the Company will enter into an interest rate lock commitment with a potential borrower. The Company may enter into a corresponding commitment with an investor to sell that loan at a specific price shortly after origination. In accordance with FASB ASC 820, adjustments are recorded through earnings to account for the net change in fair value of these transactions for the held for sale loan pipeline. The fair value of held for sale loans can vary based on the interest rate locked with the customer and the current market interest rate at the balance sheet date.

 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each client s credit-worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the client. Collateral varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing commercial properties. 
 Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients. The Company holds collateral supporting those commitments when deemed necessary by management. The liability at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for guarantees under standby letters of credit issued was not considered to be material.

The reserve is based on management's estimate of expected losses in its off-balance sheet credit exposures. The reserve specific to unfunded loan commitments is determined by applying utilization assumptions based on historical experience and applying the expected loss rates by loan class. The change in the reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded as a provision or reduction to expense through the provision for credit losses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded a reversal in the provision for credit losses of thousand and thousand for off-balance sheet credit exposures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 The Company had municipal bond and CMOs measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Level 3 valuation is based on a non-executable broker quote, which is considered a significant unobservable input. Such quotes are updated as available and may remain constant for a period of time for certain broker-quoted securities that do not move with the market or that are not interest rate sensitive as a result of their structure or overall attributes. 
 The Company s residential mortgage LHFS are recorded at fair value utilizing Level 2 measurements. This fair value measurement is determined based upon third party quotes obtained on similar loans. For loans held-for-sale, for which the fair value option has been elected, the aggregate fair value was greater than the aggregate principal balance by thousand as of September 30, 2024 and below the aggregate principal balance by million as of December 31, 2023.

 Certain financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value for these financial assets. 
 There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Individually Evaluated Loans 
 Loans individually evaluated for credit expected losses include nonaccrual loans and other loans that do not share similar risk characteristics to loans in the CECL loan pools, which have been classified as Level 3. Individually evaluated loans with an allocation to the ACL are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for credit losses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 The measurement of loss associated with loans evaluated individually for all loan classes was based on either the observable market price of the loan, the fair value of the collateral or DCF. For collateral-dependent loans, fair value was measured based on the value of the collateral securing the loan, less estimated costs to sell. Collateral may be in the form of real estate or business assets including equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. The value of the real estate collateral is determined utilizing an income or market valuation approach based on an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser outside of the Company using observable market data (Level 2). However, if the collateral is a house or building in the process of construction or if management adjusts the appraisal value, then the fair value is considered Level 3. The value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal, if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable business financial statements if not considered significant using observable market data. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivable collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports (Level 3). 
 Changes in the fair value of individually evaluated loans still held and considered in the determination of the provision for credit losses were increases due to the acquired of million and million for the three and nine months ended

 OREO property acquired through foreclosure is initially recorded at the fair value of the property at the transfer date less estimated selling cost. Subsequently, OREO is carried at the lower of its carrying value or the fair value less estimated selling cost. Fair value is usually determined based upon an independent third-party appraisal of the property or occasionally upon a recent sales offer. The Company had OREO of thousand at September 30, 2024 acquired in the Merger, which there have been no subsequent write-downs. The Company had OREO balances at December 31, 2023. 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights 
 MSRs are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair value, which is determined through a DCF valuation. To the extent the amortized cost of the MSRs exceeds their estimated fair values, a valuation allowance is established for such impairment. Fair value adjustments on the MSRs only occurs if there is an impairment charge. At September 30, 2024, the MSR impairment reserve was thousand. There was MSR impairment reserve at December 31, 2023. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was an impairment valuation allowance adjustment of thousand in mortgage banking activities on the unaudited consolidated statements of operations.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Orrstown and should be read in conjunction with the preceding unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024. Throughout this discussion, the yield on earning assets is stated on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and balances represent average daily balances unless otherwise stated. All dollar amounts presented in the tables, except per share amounts, are in thousands. 
 Overview 
 The Company, headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, is a one-bank holding company that has elected status as a financial holding company. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total assets of 5.5 billion, total liabilities of 5.0 billion and total shareholders equity of 516.2 million. 
 The Company acquired Codorus Valley and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary PeoplesBank, A Codorus Valley Company on July 1, 2024. The merger and acquisition method of accounting was used to account for the transaction with the Company as the acquirer. The Company recorded the assets and liabilities of Codorus Valley at their respective fair values as of July 1, 2024. The transaction was valued at 233.4 million and expanded the Bank s footprint into the York, Pennsylvania market while increasing its market penetration in its existing markets. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a net loss of 7.9 million and net income of 9.0 million, respectively.

credit quality; inability to raise capital, if necessary, under favorable conditions; volatility in the securities markets; the demand for our products and services; deteriorating economic conditions; geopolitical tensions; operational risks including, but not limited to, cybersecurity incidents, fraud, natural disasters and future pandemics; expenses associated with litigation and legal proceedings; the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the merger with Codorus Valley (the Merger are not realized when expected or at all; the possibility that the Merger may be more expensive to complete and integrate than anticipated; the possibility that revenues following the Merger may be lower than expected; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the completion of the Merger; the ability to complete the integration of the two companies successfully; the dilution caused by the Company s issuance of additional shares of its capital stock in connection with the Merger; and other risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the sections titled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other filings made with the SEC. The statements are valid only as of the date hereof and we disclaim any obligation to update this information. 
 Economic Climate, Inflation and Interest Rates 
 Preliminary real GDP was 2.8 on an annualized basis for the third quarter of 2024, which was a decrease from 3.0 for the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease from 4.9 during the third quarter of 2023. The decline from the second quarter of 2024 was due to a decrease in residential fixed investment, including residential structures and equipment, and private inventory investment. Fluctuations in real GDP in recent periods, due to inflation, credit conditions and geopolitical tensions, continue to create uncertainty in the current economic environment. The personal consumption expenditures ("PCE") price index increased by 1.5 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to an increase of 2.5 for second quarter of 2024 and 2.9 for the third quarter of 2023. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased by 2.2 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.8 in the second quarter of 2024 and 2.4 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 The national unemployment rate was 4.1 in both October and June 2024 compared to 3.8 in September 2023. Within the Company's geographic footprint, the unemployment rate in Pennsylvania was 3.4 in September 2024 and 2023. The unemployment rate increased in Maryland from 1.6 in September 2023 to 2.9 in September 2024; however, it remains significantly below the national level. These state-wide unemployment rates are consistent with those experienced by the counties in which the Company operates branches and other corporate offices. There were notable job gains nationally in healthcare, construction and government during the third quarter of 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, the 10-year Treasury bond yield was 3.81 , a decrease from 3.88 at December 31, 2023 and 4.59 at September 30, 2023 which was attributed to the FOMC's decision to reduce the Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points in September 2024. The decrease was based on the progress towards the FOMC's 2.0 inflation target and the unemployment rate remaining low despite recent slowing in job gains. 
 The majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and, therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. However, inflation does have an impact on the Company, particularly with respect to the growth of total assets and noninterest expenses, which tend to rise during periods of general inflation. Risks also exist due to supply and demand imbalances, employment shortages, the interest rate environment, and geopolitical tensions. It is possible that estimates made in the financial statements could be materially and adversely impacted in the near term as a result of these conditions, including expected credit losses on loans and the fair value of financial instruments that are carried at fair value. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The Company s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP and follow accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities and general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, and assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the balance sheet date and through the date the financial statements are filed with the SEC. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. The more critical accounting estimates include accounting for credit losses, income tax methodologies and accounting for business combinations. 
 Business Combinations 
 The Company accounts for its mergers and acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of the FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Under ASC 805, the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles and customer list intangibles, and liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
 56 

Table of Contents 

recognized at their acquisition-date fair value, while transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with the business combination are expensed as incurred. The excess of the merger consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is allocated to goodwill. 
 The valuations are based upon management s assumptions of future growth rates, future attrition, discount rates and other relevant factors, which involves a significant level of estimation and uncertainty. In addition, management engaged independent third-party specialists to assist in the development of the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the acquisition date if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the merger date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Adjustments would be recorded to goodwill during the current reporting period. Examples of the impacted acquired loans and assumed liabilities includes loans, deposits, identifiable intangible assets, borrowings and certain other assets and liabilities. 
 For acquired loans at the merger date, management evaluated and classified loans based upon whether the loans had experienced a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deteriorating since origination. To determine the fair value of the loans, significant estimates and assumptions were applied, including projected cash flows, discount rates, repayment speeds, credit loss severity rates, default rates and realizable collateral values. At acquisition, the allowance on PCD loans is booked directly to the ACL using the Company s existing ACL methodology, but there is no initial impact to net income. Subsequent to acquisition, future changes in estimates of expected credit losses on PCD loans are recognized as provision expense (or reversal of provision expense). The ACL for non-PCD loans is recognized as a provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the business acquisition, using the Company s existing ACL methodology. 
 These critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Significant accounting policies and any changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

increased by 114 basis points from 5.47 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.61 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to the accretion recognized on fair value marks to loans and securities assumed in the Merger. This increase in yield on interest earning assets was partially offset by an increase of 88 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities from 2.19 to 3.07 due primarily to increased funding costs on deposits from higher market interest rates and competitive pressures and an increase in the interest rate on Orrstown Financial Services, Inc.'s subordinated notes, which converted from a fixed rate to a floating rate on December 30, 2023. 
 Average loans increased by 1.7 billion to 4.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 18.8 million from 12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 31.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 88 basis points from 2.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.07 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as funding costs increased due to higher market interest rates and competitive pressures on deposit pricing.

months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average borrowings increased by 31.7 million from 175.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 206.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which included average subordinated debt and trust preferred debt of 68.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 36.3 million, from an average of 32.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is due to the assumed subordinated debt of 31.0 million and trust preferred debt of 10.3 million from the Merger, net of fair value marks. The interest rate increased on Orrstown Financial Services, Inc.'s outstanding subordinated notes of 32.5 million, which converted from a fixed rate of 6.00 to a floating rate of 8.77 on December 30, 2023. The subordinated notes from the Merger have a fixed rate of interest equal to 4.50 until December 30, 2025.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 136 thousand for the same period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses increased primarily due to 15.5 million of reserves on acquired non-PCD loans as a result of the Merger, partially offset by a provision reversal of 1.8 million due to changes in qualitative factors, a change in the peer group utilized for the calculation and a reduction of 434 thousand in the required reserve for unfunded commitments. The change in qualitative factors included a reduction in the Economic Conditions qualitative factor and removal of the Other External Factors qualitative factor. The ACL to total loan ratio was 1.25 at both September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the provision for credit losses was driven by an increase in commercial loans and an increase in the Delinquency and Classified Loan Trends qualitative factor for the commercial industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loan classes. The change in this qualitative factor was based on a recent trend of increases in loans downgraded to the special mention risk rating, which is reflected in the provision for credit losses noted above. In addition, the provision for credit losses was impacted by the change in expected loss rates under CECL. Favorable published trends in unemployment and GDP rates impacted the extent of provisioning required in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 269 thousand compared to net charge-offs of 241 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Nonaccrual loans were 0.68 of gross loans at September 30, 2024, compared with 0.98 of gross loans at September 30, 2023. Nonaccrual loans increased by 4.8 million from 22.3 million at September 30, 2023 to 27.1 million at September 30, 2024. This reflects 12.8 million of nonaccrual loans assumed in the Merger and additions of 16.2 million at the Bank, mainly consisting of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by repayments of 24.0 million.

Noninterest Income 
 The following table compares noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Three Months Ended September 30, Change Change 2024 2023 2024-2023 2024-2023 Service charges on deposit accounts 1,801 1,020 781 76.6 Interchange income 1,779 963 816 84.7 Other service charges, commissions and fees 559 240 319 132.9 Swap fee income 505 255 250 98.0 Trust and investment management income 3,760 1,853 1,907 102.9 Brokerage income 1,277 973 304 31.2 Mortgage banking activities 491 (142) 633 (445.8) Income from life insurance 1,289 620 669 107.9 Other income 654 141 513 363.8 Investment securities gains 271 2 269 13,450.0 Total noninterest income 12,386 5,925 6,461 109.0 
 Noninterest income increased by 6.5 million from 5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The primary driver of the overall increase was the impact of the Merger in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The following were significant components of the change in this line item that did not result from the Merger: 
 Wealth management income , which includes trust and investment management income and brokerage income, continues to grow due to strong market performance and growth in managed assets, both organically and through the acquisition of two registered investment advisory firms since September 2023 with total assets under management of 151 million. 
 Swap fee income increased by 250 thousand as swap fee income will fluctuate based on market conditions and client demand. 
 Mortgage banking income increased by 633 thousand. Mortgage loans sold totaled 10.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, the fair value mark on the mortgage loans held-for-sale increased by 411 thousand from a negative fair value mark of 369 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to a positive fair value mark of 42 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other income increased by 513 thousand due primarily to solar tax credits of 349 thousand. 
 The gain on investment securities was due to a security redemption and the mark-to-market activity on an equity security. 
 Other line items within noninterest income showed fluctuations attributable to normal business operations.

 Noninterest expense increased by 39.9 million from 20.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 60.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The primary driver of the overall increase was the impact of the Merger in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The following were additional significant components of the change in this line item: 
 Merger-related expenses totaled 17.0 million, which primarily included employee separation costs, vendor contract terminations and professional fees incurred in connection with the Merger. 
 Salaries and employee benefits expense includes a 4.8 million charge associated with the retirement of an executive. 
 Data processing expense increased by 798 thousand due to the use of two core processing systems until the system conversion process is completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Intangible asset amortization expense increased by 2.2 million due to the amortization recognized on the core deposit intangible and wealth customer relationship intangible established on July 1, 2024 as a result of the Merger. 
 Restructuring expense of 257 thousand was recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the announced closure of six branch locations to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Other operating expenses increased by 2.2 million, partially due to an increase in credit valuation adjustments on derivatives of 780 thousand. The remaining change is attributed to the impact of the merger and normal business operations. 
 Other line items within noninterest expenses showed fluctuations attributable to normal business operations. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax benefit totaled 2.0 million, an effective tax rate of 20.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with income tax expense of 2.5 million and an effective tax rate of 21.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s effective tax rate is less than the 21 federal statutory rate due to interest earned on tax-exempt loans and investment securities, income from life insurance policies and tax credits partially offset by disallowed interest expenses and the impact of nondeductible merger-related costs. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the impact of the Merger and fluctuation in the portion of interest expense disallowed as a deduction against earnings under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982.

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis increased by 25.9 million to 105.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 79.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's net interest spread decreased by 11 basis points from 3.44 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.33 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the increase in cost of funds. 
 Taxable-equivalent net interest margin increased by 5 basis points to 3.88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The recognition of interest income previously applied to principal of 1.6 million from the payoff of a commercial real estate loan on nonaccrual status contributed five basis points to the Company's net interest margin during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets increased by 92 basis points from 5.31 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , due primarily to the accretion recognized on fair value marks to loans and securities assumed in the Merger. This incre ase in yield on interest earning assets was more than offset by the increase of 103 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities from 1.87 to 2.90 due primarily to increased funding costs on deposits from higher market interest rates and competitive pressures and an increase in the interest rate on Orrstown Financial Services, Inc.'s subordinated notes, which converted from a fixed rate to a floating rate on December 30, 2023. 
 Average loans increased by 654.5 million to 2.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The 39 basis point increase reflected the impact from the higher interest r ates as well as the recognition of discounts recorded on securities assumed from the Merger. Accretion on acquired investment securities was 870 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. . The average balance of investment securities increased by 112.4 million to 636.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 524.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to the Merger.

Average interest-bearing demand deposits increased by 408.3 million, average time deposits increased by 323.0 million and average savings deposits increased by 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in relation to the comparable prior period. Amortization of fair value marks on acquired time deposits was 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest expense on borrowings increased by 1.3 million to 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as the cost of borrowings increased by 57 basis points to 5.00 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.43 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average borrowings increased by 14.5 million from 168.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 183.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included average subordinated debt and trust preferred debt of 44.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 12.3 million, from an average of 32.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to the assumed subordinated debt of 31.0 million and trust preferred debt of 10.3 million from the Merger. The interest rate increased on Orrstown Financial Services, Inc.'s outstanding subordinated notes of 32.5 million, which converted from a fixed rate of 6.00 to a floating rate of 8.77 on December 30, 2023. The subordinated notes assumed from the Merger have a fixed rate of interest equal to 4.50 until December 30, 2025.

The contractual interest rate on Orrstown Financial Services, Inc.'s subordinated notes was 8.75 at September 30, 2024 compared to 6.00 at September 30, 2023. Amortization of fair value marks on acquired borrowings was 152 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million for the same period in 2023, which included a reversal of the provision for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures of 557 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The provision for credit losses increased primarily due to 15.5 million of reserves on acquired non-PCD loans. The ACL to total loan ratio remained at 1.25 at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. The provision expense recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to commercial loan growth, an increase in the Delinquency and Classified Loan Trends qualitative factor for the commercial industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loan classes and an increase in the Economic Conditions qualitative factor for consumer loans and an overall increase in expected loss rates under CECL, which was adopted on January 1, 2023. 
 Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 340 thousand compared to net charge-offs of 587 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Nonaccrual loans were 0.68 of gross loans at September 30, 2024, compared with 0.98 of gross loans at September 30, 2023. Nonaccrual loans increased by 4.8 million from 22.3 million at September 30, 2023 to 27.1 million at September 30, 2024. This reflects 12.8 million of nonaccrual loans assumed in the Merger and additions of 16.2 million at the Bank, mainly consisting of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by repayments of 24.0 million.

Noninterest Income 
 The following table compares noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Change 2024 2023 2024-2023 2024-2023 Service charges on deposit accounts 3,824 2,966 858 28.9 Interchange income 3,651 2,921 730 25.0 Other service charges, commissions and fees 1,019 702 317 45.2 Swap fee income 1,079 451 628 139.2 Trust and investment management income 7,916 5,668 2,248 39.7 Brokerage income 3,535 2,727 808 29.6 Mortgage banking activities 1,318 448 870 194.2 Income from life insurance 2,569 1,855 714 38.5 Other income 1,023 1,431 (408) (28.5) Investment securities losses 254 (8) 262 3,275.0 Total noninterest income 26,188 19,161 7,027 36.7 
 Noninterest income increased by 7.0 million from 19.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 26.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The primary driver of the overall increase was the impact of the Merger in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The following were significant components of the change in this line item that did not result from the Merger: 
 Wealth management income increased by 3.1 million due to strong market performance and growth in managed assets, both organically and through the acquisition of two registered investment advisory firms since September 2023 with total assets under management of 151 million. 
 Swap fee income increased by 628 thousand as swap fee income will fluctuate based on market conditions and client demand. 
 Mortgage banking income increased by 870 thousand. Mortgage loans sold totaled 33.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included a 7.2 million portfolio sold to another institution in the three months ended March 31, 2024, co mpared to 19.9 million in the n ine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other income decreased by 408 thousand due primarily to a gain of 1.2 million from the sale of the Bank's Path Valley branch during the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by 349 thousand of solar tax credit income recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The gain on investment securities was due to a security redemption and the mark-to-market activity on an equity security. 
 Other line items within noninterest income showed fluctuations attributable to normal business operations.

 Noninterest expense increased by 44.0 million from 61.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 105.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The primary driver of the overall increase was the impact of the Merger in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The following were additional significant components of the change in this line item: 
 Merger-related expenses totaled 18.8 million, which primarily included employee separation costs, vendor contract terminations and professional fees incurred in connection with the Merger. 
 Salaries and employee benefits expense includes a 4.8 million charge associated with the retirement of an executive. 
 Data processing expense increased by 882 thousand due to the use of two core processing systems until the system conversion process is completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Intangible asset amortization expense increased by 2.2 million due to the amortization recognized on the core deposit intangible and wealth customer relationship intangible established on July 1, 2024 as a result of the Merger. 
 Restructuring expense of 257 thousand was recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the announced closure of six branch locations to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Other operating expenses increased by 1.9 million partially due to an increase in credit valuation adjustments on derivatives of 545 thousand. The remaining change is attributed to the impact of the merger and normal business operations. 
 Other line items within noninterest expenses showed fluctuations attributable to normal business operations. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense totaled 2.3 million, an effective tax rate of 21.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 7.3 million and an effective tax rate of 20.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s effective tax rate is greater than the 21 federal statutory rate due to disallowed interest expense, state income taxes and nondeductible merger-related expenses partially offset by tax-exempt income, including interest earned on tax-exempt loans and investment securities, income from life insurance policies and tax credits. The increase in the effective tax rate from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in the portion of interest expense disallowed as a deduction against earnings under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, an increase in state taxes as a result of a greater percentage of taxable income earned in a state with a state income tax and the nondeductible merger-related expenses.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Management devotes substantial time to overseeing the investment in and costs to fund loans and investment securities through deposits and borrowings, as well as the formulation and adherence to policies directed toward enhancing profitability and managing the risks associated with these investments. 
 Investment Securities 
 The Company utilizes investment securities to manage interest rate risk, enhance income through interest and dividend income and collateralize certain deposits and borrowings. 
 The Company has established investment policies and an asset/liability management policy to assist in administering its investment portfolio. Decisions to purchase or sell these securities are based on economic conditions and management s strategy to respond to changes in interest rates, liquidity, pledges to secure deposits and repurchase agreements and other factors while trying to maximize return on the investments. The Company may segregate its investment security portfolio into three categories: securities available-for-sale, trading securities and securities held-to-maturity. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management classified the entire investment securities portfolio as AFS, which is accounted for at current market value with non-credit related losses and gains reported in OCI, net of income taxes. 
 The Company's investment securities portfolio includes debt investments that are subject to varying degrees of credit and market risks, which arise from general market conditions and factors impacting specific industries, as well as news that may impact specific issues. Management monitors its debt securities, using various indicators in determining whether unrealized losses on debt securities are credit related and require an ACL. These indicators include the amount of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position, the cause and extent of the unrealized loss and the credit quality of the issuer and underlying assets. In addition, management assesses whether it is likely the Company will have to sell the investment security prior to recovery, or it expects to be able to hold the investment security until the price recovers. The Company determined that the declines in market value were due to increases in interest rates and market movements, and not due to credit factors. The Company does not intend to sell these securities with unrealized losses and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell them before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the unrealized losses for the AFS securities did not require an ACL at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, AFS securities totaled 826.8 million, an increase of 313.3 million, from 513.5 million at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased 190.3 million of AFS securities excluding AFS securities acquired in the Merger, which included 188.0 million of agency MBS and CMO securities, 1.5 million of non-agency CMO securities and 788 thousand of investment securities issued by state and political subdivisions. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company acquired AFS securities with a fair value totaling 327.1 million. To align with the Company's investment strategy and to achieve higher yielding results, 162.7 million of the acquired AFS securities were sold, which included 91.5 million of MBS and CMO's, 27.1 million of corporate debt securities, 24.4 million of securities issued by state and political subdivisions and 19.7 million of securities issued by U.S. government agencies. In addition, calls of non-agency CMO securities totaled 18.0 million and there were paydowns of 40.0 million. The balance of investment securities included net unrealized losses of 19.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to net unrealized losses of 35.6 million at December 31, 2023 for a decrease of 16.7 million. This decrease in net unrealized losses was primarily due to lower treasury rates and narrower credit spreads compared to December 31, 2023. The overall duration of the Company's investment securities portfolio was 4.6 years at September 30, 2024 compared to 4.3 years at December 31, 2023. The Company has sufficient access to liquidity such that management does not believe it would be necessary to sell any of its investment securities at a loss to offset any unexpected deposit outflows. Management believes the structure of the Company's investment security portfolio is appropriately aligned with the rest of the balance sheet to protect against volatile interest rate environments, to provide a source of liquidity and to generate steady earnings.

 Loan Portfolio 
 The Company offers a variety of products to meet the credit needs of its borrowers, principally commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, retail loans secured by residential properties, and, to a lesser extent, installment loans. No loans are extended to non-domestic borrowers or governments. 
 The risks associated with lending activities differ among loan segments and classes and are subject to the impact of changes in interest rates, market conditions of collateral securing the loans and general economic conditions. Any of these factors may adversely impact a borrower s ability to repay loans, and also impact the associated collateral. A further discussion on the Company's loan segments and classes, the related risks, ACL and FDM are included in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements under Part I, Item 1, "Financial Information."

 Total loans increased by 1.7 billion from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. This increase is due to 1.6 million in loans acquired in the Merger and continued portfolio growth in the commercial loans segment and residential mortgage segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Asset Quality 
 Risk Elements 
 The Company s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk. Credit risk is managed through the Company's underwriting standards, on-going credit reviews and monitoring of asset quality measures. Additionally, loan portfolio diversification, which limits exposure to a single industry or borrower, and collateral requirements also mitigate the Company's risk of credit loss. 
 The loan portfolio consists principally of loans to borrowers in south central Pennsylvania and the greater Baltimore, Maryland region. As the majority of loans are concentrated in these geographic regions, a substantial portion of the borrowers' ability to honor their obligations may be affected by the level of economic activity in these market areas. 
 Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate. In addition, loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing are also deemed to be risk assets. For all loan classes, the accrual of interest income on loans, including individually evaluated loans, ceases when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more and collateral is inadequate to cover principal and interest or immediately if, in the opinion of management, full collection is unlikely. Interest will continue to accrue on loans past due 90 days or more if the collateral is adequate to cover principal and interest, and the loan is in the process of collection. Interest accrued, but not collected, as of the date of placement on nonaccrual status, is generally reversed and charged against interest income, unless fully collateralized. Subsequent payments received are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal. Loans are returned to accrual status, for all loan classes, when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, the loans have performed in accordance with the contractual terms of the note for a reasonable period of time, generally six months, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured. Past due status is based on contract terms of the loan. 
 In accordance with ASU 2022-02, the Company is required to evaluate, based on the accounting for loan modifications, whether the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and if the modification results in a more-than-insignificant direct change in the contractual cash flows and represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan, which the Company refers to these loans as "financial difficulty modifications" or "FDMs."

 Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate. Risk assets, which include nonperforming assets, FDMs still accruing and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, totaled 36.9 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 11.3 million from 25.6 million at December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual loans increased by 1.4 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 due primarily to additions in commercial and commercial real estate loans partially offset by the payoffs of two commercial real estate loans with outstanding balances totaling 15.0 million with no charge-offs recorded on these relationships. Nonaccrual loans totaling 12.8 million were acquired in the Merger. During 2024, the Company had 11.4 million in loan modifications meeting the FDM criteria under ASU 2022-02, which included 6.4 million in acquired loans from the Merger and three new loan modifications during the third quarter of 2024 totaling 5.0 million. There were 1.9 million in FDM loans in nonaccrual status at September 30, 2024.

 The following table presents our exposure to relationships that are individually evaluated and the partial charge-offs taken to date and specific reserves established on those relationships at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. # of Relationships Individually Evaluated Loans Partial Charge-offs to Date Specific Reserves September 30, 2024 Relationships greater than 1,000,000 7 12,688 3,337 Relationships greater than 500,000 but less than 1,000,000 6 5,019 313 738 Relationships greater than 250,000 but less than 500,000 9 2,971 469 Relationships less than 250,000 112 6,417 444 263 134 27,095 757 4,807 December 31, 2023 Relationships greater than 1,000,000 4 20,363 Relationships greater than 500,000 but less than 1,000,000 1 616 388 Relationships greater than 250,000 but less than 500,000 1 257 Relationships less than 250,000 78 4,472 214 77 84 25,708 602 77 
 The Company takes partial charge-offs on collateral-dependent loans when carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, as determined by the most recent appraisal adjusted for current (within the quarter) conditions, less costs to dispose. Specific reserves remain in place if updated appraisals are pending and represent management s estimate of potential loss. 
 Internal loan reviews are completed annually on all commercial relationships, secured by commercial real estate, with a committed loan balance in excess of 1.0 million, which includes confirmation of risk rating by an independent credit officer. In addition, all commercial relationships greater than 500 thousand rated Substandard, Doubtful or Loss are reviewed and

corresponding risk ratings are reaffirmed by the Bank's Problem Loan Committee, with subsequent reporting to the Management ERM Committee. 
 In its individually evaluated loan analysis, the Company determines the extent of any full or partial charge-offs that may be required, or any reserves that may be needed. The determination of the Company s charge-offs or specific reserve include an evaluation of the outstanding loan balance and the related collateral securing the credit. Through a combination of collateral securing the loans and partial charge-offs taken to date, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for the potential losses that it may incur on these relationships at September 30, 2024. However, over time, additional information may result in increased reserve allocations or, alternatively, it may be deemed that the reserve allocations exceed those that are needed. 
 Credit Risk Management 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The Company maintains the ACL at a level deemed adequate by management for expected credit losses. As disclosed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, on January 1, 2023 the Company implemented CECL and increased the ACL with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the ACL of 2.4 million. In addition, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to the ACL for off-balance sheet exposures of 100 thousand. The Company s ACL is calculated quarterly, with any adjustment recorded to the provision for credit losses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. A comprehensive analysis of the ACL is performed by the Company on a quarterly basis. Management evaluates the adequacy of the ACL utilizing a defined methodology to determine if it properly addresses the current and expected risks in the loan portfolio, which considers the performance of borrowers and specific evaluation of individually evaluated loans, including historical loss experiences, trends in delinquencies, nonperforming loans and other risk assets, and the qualitative factors. Risk factors are continuously reviewed and adjusted, as needed, by management when conditions support a change. Management believes its approach properly addresses relevant accounting and bank regulatory guidance for loans both collectively and individually evaluated. The results of the comprehensive analysis, including recommended changes, are governed by the Company's Reserve Adequacy Committee and subsequently presented to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee. 
 The ACL is evaluated based on a review of the collectability of loans in light of historical experience; the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay; estimated value of any underlying collateral; and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. A description of the methodology for establishing the allowance and provision for credit losses and related procedures in establishing the appropriate level of reserve is included in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements under Part I, Item 1, "Financial Information." 
 The following table presents the amortized cost basis of the loan portfolio, by year of origination, loan class and credit quality as of September 30, 2024. For residential and consumer loan classes, the Company also evaluates credit quality based on the aging status of the loan and payment activity. Residential mortgage and installment and other consumer loans are presented below based on payment performance: performing or nonperforming. During 2024, commercial and land development loans totaling 20.6 million were recharacterized to a permanent commercial real estate class upon the completion of construction or receiving a certificate of occupancy. In addition, 1-4 family residential construction loans totaling 14.9 million were recharacterized to a permanent 1-4 family residential mortgage upon the completion of construction.

 The Special Mention classification is intended to be a temporary classification reflective of loans that have potential weaknesses that may, if not monitored or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the Company s position at some future date. Special Mention loans represent an elevated risk, but their weakness does not yet justify a more severe, or classified, rating. These loans require inquiry by lenders on the cause of the potential weakness and, once evaluated, the loan classification may be downgraded to Substandard or, alternatively, could be upgraded to Pass. 
 Special Mention loans increased by 43.9 million from 24.2 million at December 31, 2023 to 68.1 million at September 30, 2024 due to acquired loans from the Merger of 51.1 million and downgrades at the Bank of 14.2 million, partially offset by repayments, including 8.6 million from two commercial and industrial clients and 3.9 million from two commercial real estate clients. 
 Classified loans totaled 105.5 million at September 30, 2024, or 2.6 of total loans outstanding, reflecting an increase from 49.0 million, or 2.1 of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2023. 
 Non-IEL substandard loans are performing loans, which have characteristics that cause management concern over the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of these loans as nonperforming, or individually evaluated, loans in the future. Generally, management feels that substandard loans that are currently performing and not considered individually evaluated result in some doubt as to the borrower s ability to continue to perform under the terms of the loan and represent potential problem loans. Non-IEL substandard loans totaled 78.3 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 49.0 million, compared to 29.3 million at December 31, 2023, due primarily to acquired loans from the Merger of 35.7 million and downgrades at the Bank consisting of two commercial and industrial clients and two commercial real estate clients with loans totaling 7.6 million and 2.6 million, respectively. The Substandard-IEL category increased from 25.7 million at December 31, 2023 to 27.1 million at September 30, 2024, primarily due to acquired loans from the Merger of 12.9 million and downgrades at the Bank totaling 9.4 million consisting of two commercial and industrial clients with loans totaling 6.6 million and two commercial real estate clients with loans totaling 2.7 million, partially offset by repayments including the payoff of loans to three commercial real estate clients with an outstanding balance of 16.4 million and a residential mortgage loan of 1.6 million at December 31, 2023.

 The ACL totaled 49.6 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 20.9 million from December 31, 2023, resulting primarily from the provision for credit losses on non-PCD loans of 15.5 million related to the Merger, the allowance for credit losses on PCD loans from the Merger of 5.9 million, other provision for credit losses of 15,348 thousand and net charge-offs of 340 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The ACL as a percentage of the total loan portfolio was 1.25 at both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the provision for credit losses was driven by the increase in commercial loans, the increase in the loss reserve rates under the CECL methodology and an increase in the Delinquency and Classified Loan Trends qualitative factor for the commercial industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loan classes. 
 The Company takes partial charge-offs on collateral-dependent loans when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, as determined by the most recent appraisal adjusted for current (within the quarter) conditions, less costs to dispose. Specific reserves remain in place if updated appraisals are pending and represent management's estimate of potential loss. In addition to the specific reserve allocations on individually evaluated loans noted previously, 11 loans, with aggregate outstanding principal balances of 1.2 million, had cumulative partial charge-offs to the ACL totaling 757 thousand through September 30, 2024. As updated appraisals are received on collateral-dependent loans, partial charge-offs are taken to the extent the loans principal balance exceeds their fair value. 
 Management believes the allocation of the ACL among the various loan classes adequately reflects the life expected credit losses in each loan class and is based on the methodology outlined in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and 
 81 

Table of Contents 

Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1, "Financial Information." Management re-evaluates and makes enhancements to its reserve methodology to better reflect the risks inherent in the different segments of the portfolio, particularly in light of increased charge-offs, with noticeable differences between the different loan classes. Management believes these enhancements to the ACL methodology improve the accuracy of quantifying the expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio. Management charges actual loan losses to the reserve and bases the provision for credit losses on its overall analysis. 
 Management believes the Company s ACL is adequate based on currently available information. Future adjustments to the ACL and enhancements to the methodology may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions, regulatory guidance, or management s assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates. 
 Deposits 
 Total deposits increased by 2.1 billion to 4.7 billion at September 30, 2024 from 2.6 billion at December 31, 2023, which included 1.9 billion in deposits assumed from the Merger. Money market deposits increased by 718.4 million, time deposits increased by 600.4 million, non-interest bearing demand deposits increased by 384.4 million, interest-bearing demand deposits increased by 285.4 million and savings deposits increased by 103.4 million. These increases were primarily attributable to the Merger. Interest-bearing demand deposits can fluctuate based on seasonal public funds activity. The increase in time deposits also reflected promotional offerings of up to 18-month terms. A t September 30, 2024, deposits that are uninsured and not collateralized totaled 692.6 million, or 15 of total deposits, compared to 442.7 million, or 17 of total deposits, at December 31, 2023. 
 Borrowings 
 In addition to deposits, the Company uses borrowing sources to meet liquidity needs and for temporary funding. Sources of short-term borrowings include the FHLB of Pittsburgh, federal funds purchased and the FRB discount window. Short-term borrowings also may include securities sold under agreements to repurchase with deposit clients, in which a client sweeps a portion of a deposit balance into a repurchase agreement, which is a secured borrowing with a pool of securities pledged against the balance. 
 The Company also utilizes long-term debt, consisting principally of FHLB fixed and amortizing advances, to fund its balance sheet with original maturities greater than one year. Prior to entering into long-term borrowings, the Company evaluates its funding needs, interest rate movements, the cost of options and the availability of attractive structures. 
 FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased by 22.5 million to 115.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 137.5 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank repaid overnight borrowings during the first quarter of 2024 based on available liquidity from deposits. 
 In December 2018, the Company issued unsecured subordinated notes payable totaling 32.5 million, which mature on December 30, 2028, and the proceeds of which were designated for general corporate use, including funding of cash consideration for mergers and acquisitions. The subordinated notes had a fixed interest rate of 6.0 through December 30, 2023, which then converted to a variable rate, three-month CME term SOFR rate plus 3.16 , through maturity. At September 30, 2024, the contractual interest rate on the subordinated debt was 8.75 . 
 The Company assumed unsecured subordinated notes of 31.0 million from the Merger. The subordinated notes have a fixed rate of interest equal to 4.50 until December 30, 2025. After that term, the variable rate of interest is equal to the three-month CME term SOFR rate plus 4.04 . The Company also assumed junior subordinated trust preferred debt of 10.3 million from the Merger, which have variable rates of three-month CME term SOFR rate, plus a spread adjustment of 0.26161 and an additional margin adjustment. 
 See Note 10, Short-Term Borrowings, Note 11, Long-Term Borrowings and Note 12, Subordinated Notes and Trust Preferred Debt, to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements under Part I, Item 1, "Financial Information," for a description and terms of the Company s borrowings and access to alternative sources of liquidity. 
 Shareholders' Equity, Capital Adequacy and Regulatory Matters 
 Capital management in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to its shareholders while maintaining sufficient levels of capital and related risk-based regulatory capital ratios to satisfy statutory regulatory requirements. The Company s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to its shareholders, while remaining well-capitalized under applicable banking regulations.

Shareholders equity totaled 516.2 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 251.2 million from 265.1 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of common stock of 233.4 million to acquire Codorus Valley, other comprehensive income of 12.6 million, net income of 8.4 million and the issuance of treasury shares for share-based compensation which reduced treasury stock by 5.5 million, partially offset by dividends paid of 8.7 million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other comprehensive income included an after-tax increase of 12.8 million from net unrealized gains on investment securities, partially offset by 249 thousand in net unrealized losses from cash flow hedges. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total comprehensive income totaled 21.0 million, a decrease of 2.6 million, from total comprehensive income of 23.6 million for the same period in 2023 due primarily to a decrease in net income of 19.7 million and an increase in after-tax net unrealized losses on cash flow hedges of 2.5 million, partially offset by a decline in after-tax net unrealized losses on investment securities of 19.5 million between the comparative perio ds. The decrease in net unrealized losses on investment securities was primarily caused by a decline in treasury rates and narrower credit spreads. 
 At September 30, 2024, book value per common share was 26.65 compared to 24.98 at December 31, 2023. Tangible book value per share decreased from 23.03 at December 31, 2023 to 21.12 at September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of the common stock issued in the Merger and purchase accounting marks recorded through shareholders' equity as a result of the Merger. See Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Measures. 
 The Company routinely evaluates its capital levels in light of its risk profile to assess its capital needs. The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank was considered well-capitalized under applicable banking regulations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies, including financial holding companies. 
 Note 13, Shareholders' Equity and Regulatory Capital, to the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1, "Financial Information," includes a table presenting capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 In addition to the minimum capital ratio requirement and minimum capital ratio to be well-capitalized presented in the referenced table in Note 13, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer as more fully described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Item 1 - Business, under the topic Basel III Capital Rules. At September 30, 2024, the Bank's capital conservation buffer, based on the most restrictive Total Capital to risk weighted assets capital ratio, was 4.2 , which is greater than the 2.5 requirement. 
 
 Liquidity 
 The primary function of asset/liability management is to ensure adequate liquidity and manage the Company s sensitivity to changing interest rates. Liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of clients who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. The Company's primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, borrowings from the FHLB of Pittsburgh and maturities and prepayments of investment securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. 
 The Company regularly adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon its assessment of expected loan demand, expected deposit flows, yields available on interest-earning deposits and investment securities and the objectives of its asset/liability management policy. The Company's most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. 
 At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 236.8 million compared to 65.2 million at December 31, 2023, which reflects the increase in deposits of 2.1 billion and net income of 8.4 million, partially offset by the decrease in borrowings of 22.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. U nencumbered investment securities totaled 90.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 73.7 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 16.5 million of investment securities pledged at the FRB Discount Window, with no associated borrowings outstanding, compared to 17.4 million at December 31, 2023. The Company's maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of Pittsburgh was 1.1 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, of which 118.2 million and 138.7 million in advances and letters of credit were outstanding at these same periods, respectively. In addition, the Company had 20.0 million in available unsecured lines of credit with other banks at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Bank tested its various sources of funding during 2024 to ensure accessibility.

 Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Measures 
 Management believes providing certain non-GAAP financial information will assist investors in their understanding of the effect on recent financial results from non-recurring charges. 
 As a result of prior acquisitions, the Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling 116.8 million and 21.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred merger-related expenses of 17.0 million and 18.8 million, respectively, in connection with the Merger with Codorus Valley. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred other non-recurring charges totaling 20.3 million. 
 Tangible book value per share and the impact of the merger-related expenses on net income and diluted earnings per share, as used by the Company in this supplemental reporting presentation, is determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. While we believe this information is a useful supplement to GAAP-based measures presented in this Form 10-Q, readers are cautioned that this non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results and financial condition as reported under GAAP, nor are such measures necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to be determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 The decrease in tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the common stock issued to acquire Codorus Valley of 233.4 million and dividends paid of 8.7 million, partially offset by other comprehensive income, net of taxes, of 12.6 million and net income of 8.4 million. Other comprehensive income increased due to net unrealized gains on AFS securities partially offset by net unrealized losses on interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments. 
 The following table presents the computation of each non-GAAP based measure shown together with its most directly comparable GAAP-based measure.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk comprises exposure to interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and other relevant market rate or price risks. In the banking industry, a major risk exposure is changing interest rates. The primary objective of monitoring our interest rate sensitivity, or risk, is to provide management the tools necessary to manage the balance sheet to minimize adverse changes in net interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates. FRB monetary control efforts, the effects of deregulation, economic uncertainty and legislative changes have been significant factors affecting the task of managing interest rate sensitivity positions in recent years. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is the exposure to fluctuations in the Bank s future earnings (earnings at risk) and value (value at risk) resulting from changes in interest rates. This exposure results from differences between the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that reprice within a specified time period as a result of scheduled maturities, scheduled and unscheduled repayments, the propensity of borrowers and depositors to react to changes in their economic interests and loan contractual interest rate changes. 
 We attempt to manage the level of repricing and maturity mismatch through our asset/liability management process so that fluctuations in net interest income are maintained within policy limits across a range of market conditions, while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements. Management recognizes that a certain amount of interest rate risk is inherent, appropriate and necessary to ensure the Bank s profitability. Thus, the goal of interest rate risk management is to evaluate the amount of reward for taking risk and adjusting both the size and composition of the balance sheet relative to the level of reward available for taking risk. 
 Management endeavors to control the exposure to changes in interest rates by understanding, reviewing and making decisions based on its risk position. The Bank primarily uses its investment securities portfolio, FHLB advances, interest rate swaps and brokered deposits to manage its interest rate risk position. Additionally, pricing, promotion and product development activities are directed in an effort to emphasize the loan and deposit term or repricing characteristics that best meet current interest rate risk objectives. 
 We use simulation analysis to assess earnings at risk and net present value analysis to assess value at risk. These methods allow management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of our interest rate risk exposure. These analyses require numerous assumptions including, but not limited to, changes in balance sheet mix, prepayment rates on loans and investment securities, cash flows and repricing of all financial instruments, changes in volumes and pricing, future shapes of the yield curve, relationship of market interest rates to each other (basis risk), credit spread and deposit sensitivity. Assumptions are based on management s best estimates but may not accurately reflect actual results under certain changes in interest rates due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and providing a relative gauge of our interest rate risk position over time.

Table of Contents 

Our Asset/Liability Committee operates under management policies, approved by the Board of Directors, which define guidelines and limits on the level of risk. The committee meets regularly and reviews our interest rate risk position and monitors various liquidity ratios to ensure a satisfactory liquidity position. By utilizing our analyses, we can determine changes that may need to be made to the asset and liability mixes to mitigate the change in net interest income under various interest rate scenarios. Management continually evaluates the condition of the economy, the pattern of market interest rates and other economic data to inform the committee on the selection of investment securities. Regulatory authorities also monitor our interest rate risk position along with other liquidity ratios. 
 Net Interest Income Sensitivity 
 Simulation analysis evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income. The analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months. The resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of our short-term interest rate risk. The analysis assumes recent pricing trends in new loan and deposit volumes will continue while balances remain constant. Additional assumptions are applied to modify pricing under the various rate scenarios. 
 The simulation analysis results are presented in the table below. At September 30, 2024, the balance sheet is asset sensitive and assets are now expected to reprice faster over the next twelve months than in prior models. The change was driven by the Merger as the assets acquired are shorter term in maturity and repricing characteristics. The funding profile is characterized similarly to the original portfolio where shorter term certificate of deposit balances had grown due to the interest rate environment, but also contain significant non-maturity deposits as well. Through the consolidation of the two portfolios, we anticipate changes to the mix of the asset and liability profiles. 
 Economic Value 
 Net present value analysis provides information on the risk inherent in the balance sheet that might not be considered in the simulation analysis due to the short time horizon used in that analysis. The net present value of the balance sheet incorporates the discounted present value of expected asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of expected liability cash flows. The analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining the expected cash flows and in discounting the cash flows. The resulting percentage change in net present value in various rate scenarios is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet. 
 Funding cost, the level of interest rates, infrastructure cost and repricing speed will continue to be a factor in the results of the model. The behavior of the business and retail clients also varies across the rate scenarios, which is reflected in the results but will continue to be refined through the combination of the two balance sheets. To improve the comparability across periods, the Bank strives to follow best practices related to the assumption setting and maintains the size and mix of the period end balance sheet; thus, the results do not reflect actions management may take through the normal course of business that would impact results.
