 Our Sonesta agreement, which expires on January 31, 2037 and includes -year renewal options, provides that we are paid an annual owner s priority return if gross revenues of the hotels, after payment of hotel operating expenses and management and related fees (other than Sonesta s incentive fee, if applicable), are sufficient to do so. The Sonesta agreement further provides that we are paid an additional return equal to of the operating profits, as defined therein, after paying the owner s priority return, reimbursing owner or manager advances, funding FF E reserves and paying Sonesta s incentive fee, if applicable. We do not have any security deposits or guarantees for our Sonesta hotels. We realized returns under our Sonesta agreement of and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Our Sonesta agreement requires us to fund capital expenditures made at our hotels.

No FF E escrow deposits were required during either of the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 Pursuant to our Sonesta agreement, we incurred management, reservation and system fees and reimbursement costs for certain guest loyalty, marketing programs and third-party reservation transmission fees of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These fees and costs are included in hotel operating expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). In addition, we incurred procurement and construction supervision fees payable to Sonesta of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which amounts have been capitalized in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related capital assets.

 of our total historical real estate investments. We lease to TA a total of travel centers under master leases that expire in 2033, or our TA leases, subject to TA s right to extend those leases, and require annual minimum rents of as of September 30, 2024. TA receives a monthly rent credit totaling per year over the initial term of the TA leases as a result of rent it prepaid. On February 28, 2024, TA acquired the leasehold interest of one of our travel centers from a third party landlord. The aggregate minimum rent due to us under our leases with TA for the remaining travel centers was unchanged as a result of TA s acquisition of this leasehold interest. 
 Our TA leases are triple net leases that require TA to pay all costs incurred in the operation of the leased travel centers, including personnel, utility, inventory, customer service and insurance expenses, real estate and personal property taxes, environmental related expenses, underground storage tank maintenance costs and ground lease payments at those travel centers at which we lease the property and sublease it to TA. Our TA leases generally require TA to indemnify us for certain environmental matters and for liabilities that arise during the terms of the leases from ownership or operation of the leased travel centers. Our TA leases do not require FF E escrow deposits. However, TA is required to maintain the leased travel centers, including structural and non-structural components. BP Corporation North America Inc. guarantees payment under each of the TA leases, limited to an aggregate cap which was as of September 30, 2024. 
 We recognized rental income from our TA leases of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Rental income was increased by and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and increased by and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to record the scheduled rent changes on a straight line basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had receivables for current rent amounts owed to us by TA and straight line rent adjustments of and , respectively, included in other assets, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Until May 15, 2023, our TA leases required TA to pay us percentage rent based upon increases in certain sales. We recognized percentage rent due under our TA leases as rental income when all contingencies were met. We recognized percentage rent of during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 under our TA leases. We had no deferred percentage rent for either the three or nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For more information regarding our relationships with TA, including the TA Merger (as defined below), see Notes 7 and 11. 
 Our other net lease agreements generally provide for minimum rent payments and in addition may include variable payments. Rental income from operating leases, including any payments derived by index or market-based indices, is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term when we have determined that the collectability of substantially all of the lease payments is probable. Some of our leases have options to extend or terminate the lease exercisable at the option of our tenants, which are considered when determining the lease term. We recognized rental income from our net lease properties (excluding TA) of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which included and , respectively, of adjustments to record scheduled rent changes under certain of our leases on a straight line basis, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which included and , respectively, of adjustments to record scheduled rent changes under certain of our leases on a straight line basis. 
 We continually review receivables related to rent, straight line rent and property operating expense reimbursements and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. The review includes an assessment of whether substantially all of the amounts due under a tenant s lease are probable of collection. For leases that are deemed probable of collection, revenue continues to be recorded on a straight line basis over the lease term. For leases that are deemed not probable of collection, revenue is recorded as cash is received. We recognize all changes in the collectability assessment for an operating lease as an adjustment to rental income. We recorded reserves for uncollectable amounts and reduced rental income by and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, based on our assessment of the collectability of rents. We reduced reserves for uncollectable amounts and increased rental income by for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and recorded reserves for uncollectible amounts and reduced rental income by for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 based on our assessment of the collectability of rents. We had reserves for uncollectable rents of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, included in other assets, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 to based on our leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, which was as of September 30, 2024. As collateral for all loans and other obligations under the credit facility, certain of our subsidiaries pledged all of their respective equity interests in certain of our direct and indirect property owning subsidiaries, and our pledged subsidiaries provided first mortgage liens on properties, including hotels and net lease properties, with an aggregate undepreciated carrying value of as of September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold hotels that served as collateral under our revolving credit facility. In connection with the sales of these hotels, the hotels were released from the collateral pool in accordance with the terms of our revolving credit facility. We also pay unused commitment fees of to basis points per annum on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility based on amounts outstanding. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the annual interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was and , respectively. We had borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility for either the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 Availability under our revolving credit facility is partially based on the performance of the properties serving as collateral under the facility. Based on recent and near term expectations of performance of certain of the collateral properties, we and our lenders amended the credit facility in October 2024 to temporarily reduce the required collateral property debt yield from to from September 30, 2024 through December 31, 2024, and increase the required collateral property debt yield to for the quarter ending March 31, 2025; for the quarter ending June 30, 2025; for the quarter ending September 30, 2025; and for the quarter ending December 31, 2025 and thereafter. Subject to meeting these revised collateral property debt yield levels and meeting other conditions, we currently have full access to undrawn amounts under our revolving credit facility. 
 Our debt agreements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, which includes The RMR Group LLC, or RMR, ceasing to act as our business manager. Our debt agreements also contain covenants, including those that restrict our ability to incur debts or to make distributions under certain circumstances and generally require us to maintain certain financial ratios. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to meeting ongoing minimum performance and market values of the collateral properties, satisfying certain financial covenants and other credit facility conditions. We believe we were in compliance with the terms and conditions of our debt agreements as of September 30, 2024.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Overview (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and per room hotel data) 
 We are a REIT organized under the laws of the State of Maryland. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 959 properties in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Canada and Puerto Rico. 
 Consumer confidence, corporate travel and lodging demand will continue to be affected by economic and market conditions, inflationary pressures, including high interest rates, unemployment levels, work from home policies, use of technologies and broader economic trends. Increased labor costs and other price inflation may continue to negatively impact our hotel operations and the operations of our tenants. An economic recession or continued or intensified disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition, operations at our hotels, our tenants and their ability or willingness to renew our leases or pay rent to us, may restrict our ability to obtain new or replacement financing, would likely increase our cost of capital, and may cause the values of our properties to decline. We have also been implementing a significant renovation plan that has caused disruption at certain of our hotels. 
 On October 16, 2024, we announced our plan to sell 114 focused service hotels managed by Sonesta with an aggregate of 14,925 keys and a net carrying value of 850,000. We expect to sell these hotels in 2025 and use the net sales proceeds from these sales to repay debt. We expect that the sales of these hotels will result in savings of approximately 725,000 in capital expenditures, which was projected to be spent over a six year period. To further improve our liquidity beginning with the fourth quarter of 2024, we reduced our regular quarterly cash distribution on our common shares from 0.20 per common share to 0.01 per common share, which we expect to result in 127,000 of annual savings. 
 Management Agreements and Leases . At September 30, 2024, we owned 214 hotels operated under four agreements. We leased all of these hotels to our wholly owned TRSs that are managed by hotel operating companies as of that date. At September 30, 2024, we also owned 745 service-focused retail properties leased to 176 tenants subject to triple net leases, where the tenants are generally responsible for the payment of operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) include hotel operating revenues and hotel operating expenses of our managed hotels and rental income and net lease operating expenses from our net lease properties. 
 Hotel Portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 214 hotels. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the U.S. hotel industry generally realized increases in revenue per available room, or RevPAR, and average daily rate, or ADR, compared to the same periods in 2023. Our comparable hotels produced year over year declines in RevPAR, which we believe is partially a result of disruption and displacement at certain of our hotels undergoing renovation and decreased business activity in areas where some of our hotels are located. The following table provides a summary for all of our hotels with these revenue metrics for the periods presented, which we believe are key indicators of performance at our hotels.

 Comparable Hotels Data . We present RevPAR, ADR and occupancy for the periods presented on a comparable basis to facilitate comparisons between periods. We define comparable hotels as those that were owned by us and were open and operating for the entirety of the periods being compared. For each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our comparable results exclude one hotel that suspended operations during the periods presented. For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our comparable results exclude two hotels. One of the hotels was not owned for the entirety of the periods presented and the other suspended operations during the periods presented.

 Net Lease Portfolio . As of September 30, 2024, we owned 745 service-focused retail net lease properties with an aggregate of 13,332,131 square feet leased to 176 tenants subject to triple net leases (where the tenants are responsible for payments of operating expenses and capital expenditures) requiring annual minimum rents of 380,034. Our net lease properties were 97.6 occupied as of September 30, 2024 with a weighted (by annual minimum rent) average lease term of 8.3 years, operating under 137 brands in 21 distinct industries. TA is our largest tenant and as of September 30, 2024, leased 175 of our travel centers under five master leases that expire in 2033 and require annual minimum rents of 259,080. In addition, TA receives an annual credit of 25,000 as a result of prepaid rent. BP Corporation North America Inc. guarantees payment under the TA leases, subject to a cap. 
 Additional details of our hotel operating agreements and our net lease agreements are set forth in Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 
 Our Managers and Tenants 
 As of September 30, 2024, all 214 of our hotels were managed by four hotel operating companies. Our 745 service-focused retail net lease properties were leased to 176 tenants as of September 30, 2024. The costs of operating and maintaining our properties are generally paid by the hotel managers as agents for us or by our tenants for their own account. Our hotel managers and tenants derive their funding for property operating expenses and for returns and rents due to us generally from property operating revenues and, to the extent these parties themselves fund our owner s priority returns and rents, from their separate resources. As of September 30, 2024, our hotel managers included Sonesta (189 hotels), Hyatt (17 hotels), Radisson (seven hotels) and IHG (one hotel). TA is our largest tenant (175 travel centers). 
 We recorded reserves for uncollectable amounts and reduced rental income by 515 and 1,557 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, based on our assessment of the collectability of rents. We reduced reserves for uncollectible amounts and increased rental income by 1,041 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and recorded reserves for uncollectable amounts and reduced rental income by 4,312 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, based on our assessment of the collectability of rents. We had reserves for uncollectable rents of 4,872 and 3,436 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, included in other assets, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 We define net lease coverage as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent, or EBITDAR, divided by the annual minimum rent due to us weighted by the minimum rent of the property to total minimum rents of the net lease portfolio. Tenants with no minimum rent required under the lease are excluded. EBITDAR amounts used to determine rent coverage are generally for the latest twelve-month period, based on the most recent operating information, if any, furnished by our tenants. Operating statements furnished by our tenants often are unaudited and, in certain cases, may not have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not independently verified by us. In instances where we do not have tenant financial information, we calculate an implied coverage ratio for the period based on other tenants with available financial statements operating the same brand or within the same industry. As a result, we believe using this implied coverage metric provides a more reasonable estimated representation of recent operating results and the financial condition for those tenants. Our net lease properties generated coverage of 2.16x and 2.72x as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Our Operating Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of funds to meet operating and capital expenses, debt service obligations and distributions to our shareholders are owner s priority returns from our hotels, rents from our net lease portfolio and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We receive owner s priority returns and rents from our managers and tenants monthly. We may receive additional returns, percentage rents and our share of the operating profits of our managed hotels after payment of management fees and other deductions, if any, either monthly or quarterly, and these amounts are usually subject to annual reconciliations. We believe these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital expenditures and pay debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. However, as a result of economic conditions, including if the U.S. enters an economic recession, or otherwise, our managers and tenants may become unable or unwilling to pay owner s priority returns and rents to us when due, and, as a result, our cash flows and net income would decline. 
 The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the beginning of the period 197,830 45,420 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 149,043 401,958 Investing activities (180,121) 50,966 Financing activities (103,906) (62,816) Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of the period 62,846 435,528 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities in the 2024 period is primarily due to 188,000 of prepaid rent received from TA in the 2023 period, higher interest expense and lower hotel returns in the 2024 period. The change from cash flow provided by investing activities in the 2023 period to cash flow used in investing activities in the 2024 period is primarily due to proceeds from the sale of TA common shares and higher proceeds from the sale of real estate in the 2023 period and increased real estate improvements during the 2024 period. The increase in cash flow used in financing activities in the 2024 period is primarily due to higher net borrowings in the 2023 period. 
 We maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the IRC by meeting certain requirements. We lease 214 hotels to our wholly owned TRSs that are managed by hotel operating companies. As a REIT, we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income; however, the income realized by our TRSs in excess of the rent they pay to us is subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate income tax rates. In addition, the income we receive from our hotels in Canada and Puerto Rico is subject to taxes in those jurisdictions and we are subject to taxes in certain states where we have properties despite our qualification for taxation as a REIT. 
 Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our hotel operating agreements generally provide that, if necessary, we may provide our managers with funding for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of amounts otherwise available in escrowed FF E reserves or when no FF E reserves are available. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we funded 208,820 for capital improvements in excess of FF E reserves available to our hotels using cash on hand. We currently expect to fund 85,000 for capital improvements to certain hotels during the last three months of 2024 using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
 Various percentages of total sales at some of our hotels are escrowed as FF E reserves to fund future capital improvements. We own all the FF E escrows for our hotels. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain of our hotel managers deposited 4,402 to these accounts and spent 4,609 from the FF E reserve escrow accounts to renovate and refurbish our hotels. As of September 30, 2024, there was 5,475 on deposit in these escrow accounts, which was held directly by us and is reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash. 
 Our net lease portfolio leases do not require FF E escrow deposits and tenants under these leases are generally required to maintain the leased properties, including structural and non-structural components. We may provide tenant improvement allowances to tenants in certain cases or may develop sites with the intent to lease them. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we funded 3,931 for capital improvements to our net lease properties. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,889 of unspent leasing-related obligations related to certain of our net lease tenants. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold seven hotels with an aggregate of 906 keys for an aggregate sales price of 48,215, excluding closing costs, and seven net lease properties with an aggregate of 86,937 square feet for an aggregate sales price of 6,532, excluding closing costs. From October 1, 2024 through November 4, 2024, we sold five hotels with an aggregate of 642 keys for an aggregate sales price of 32,200, excluding closing costs. As of November 4, 2024, we have entered into agreements to sell eight hotels with an aggregate of 985 keys for an aggregate sales price of 44,150, excluding closing costs, and one net lease property with 3,381 square feet for a sales price of 1,000, excluding closing costs. These pending sales are subject to conditions; accordingly, we cannot be sure that we will complete these sales, that these sales will not be delayed or that the terms will not change. We continue to market three hotels with an aggregate of 383 keys and nine net lease properties with an aggregate of 132,860 square feet for sale. We believe it is probable that the sales of these properties will be completed within one year. We expect to use the net sales proceeds from these sales for general business purposes. 
 In October 2024, we announced our plan to sell 114 focused service hotels managed by Sonesta, with an aggregate of 14,925 keys and an aggregate net carrying value of 850,000. We expect to sell these hotels in 2025 and use the net sales proceeds from these sales to repay debt. We expect that the sales of these hotels will result in savings of approximately 725,000 in capital expenditures, which was projected to be spent over a six year period. To further improve our liquidity beginning with the fourth quarter of 2024, we reduced our regular quarterly cash distribution on our common shares from 0.20 per common share to 0.01 per common share, which we expect to result in 127,000 of annual savings. 
 In March 2024, we made a 3,392 pro rata capital contribution to Sonesta to support its growth initiatives, including its franchising efforts, using cash on hand. We continue to maintain our 34 ownership in Sonesta after giving effect to this contribution. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we declared and paid regular quarterly distributions to our common shareholders using cash on hand as follows:

Table of Contents 

 Declaration Date Record Date Paid Date Dividend Per Common Share Total Distributions January 11, 2024 January 22, 2024 February 15, 2024 0.20 33,154 April 11, 2024 April 22, 2024 May 16, 2024 0.20 33,152 July 11, 2024 July 22, 2024 August 15, 2024 0.20 33,178 0.60 99,484 
 On October 16, 2024, we declared a regular quarterly distribution to common shareholders of record as of October 28, 2024 of 0.01 per common share, or approximately 1,666. We expect to pay this distribution on or about November 14, 2024 using cash on hand. 
 In order to meet cash needs that may result from our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain a 650,000 secured revolving credit facility which is governed by a credit agreement. This revolving credit facility is available for general business purposes, including acquisitions. We can borrow, repay, and reborrow funds available under the revolving credit facility until maturity and no principal repayments are due until maturity. Availability of borrowings under our credit agreement is subject to ongoing minimum performance and market values of the collateral properties, satisfying certain financial covenants and other credit facility conditions. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is June 29, 2027, and, subject to the payment of an extension fee and meeting certain other conditions, we have an option to further extend the stated maturity date by two additional six-month periods. 
 Interest payable on drawings under our revolving credit facility is based on SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.50 to 3.00 based on our leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, which was 2.50 as of September 30, 2024. As collateral for all loans and other obligations under the facility, certain of our subsidiaries pledged all of their respective equity interests in certain of our direct and indirect property owning subsidiaries, and our pledged subsidiaries provided first mortgage liens on 70 properties, including 67 hotels and three net lease properties, with an aggregate undepreciated carrying value of 1,720,032 as of September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold two hotels that served as collateral under our revolving credit facility. In connection with the sales of these hotels, the hotels were released from the collateral pool in accordance with the terms of our revolving credit facility. We also pay unused commitment fees of 20 to 30 basis points per annum on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility based on amounts outstanding. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the annual interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 7.46 and 7.93 , respectively. We had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 Availability under our revolving credit facility is partially based on the performance of the properties serving as collateral under the facility. Based on recent and near term expectations of performance of certain of the collateral properties, we and our lenders amended the credit facility in October 2024 to temporarily reduce the required collateral property debt yield from 12 to 8.5 from September 30, 2024 through December 31, 2024, and increase the required collateral property debt yield to 9.5 for the quarter ending March 31, 2025; 10 for the quarter ending June 30, 2025; 11 for the quarter ending September 30, 2025; and 12 for the quarter ending December 31, 2025 and thereafter. Subject to meeting these revised collateral property debt yield levels and meeting other conditions, we currently have full access to undrawn amounts under our revolving credit facility. 
 In June 2024 , we issued 700,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes and 500,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2032 Notes in underwritten public offerings. The aggregate net proceeds from these offerings were 1,162,077, after underwriting discounts and other offering expenses. These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis and on a senior unsecured basis, by all of our subsidiaries, except for our foreign subsidiaries and certain other excluded subsidiaries. Such other excluded subsidiaries include, but are not limited to, subsidiaries whose equity has been pledged to secure borrowings under our credit agreement and our 8.625 senior secured notes due 2031 and subsidiaries whose assets secure our net lease mortgage notes. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes and cash on hand to redeem all of our outstanding 7.50 senior unsecured notes due 2025 and purchase and satisfy and discharge all of our outstanding 4.50 senior unsecured notes due 2025.

Table of Contents 

 Our debt maturities (other than our revolving credit facility) as of September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 Year Maturity 2024 490 2025 1,958 2026 801,958 2027 851,958 2028 1,000,737 2029 1,125,000 2030 400,000 2031 1,000,000 2032 500,000 5,682,101 
 None of our senior note debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their maturity dates. Our mortgage notes require monthly principal payments as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We currently expect to use cash on hand, the cash flows from our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, net proceeds from any asset sales and net proceeds of offerings of equity or the incurrence of debt to fund our operations, capital expenditures, investments, future debt maturities, distributions to our shareholders and other general business purposes. 
 When significant amounts are outstanding for an extended period of time under our revolving credit facility, or the maturities of our indebtedness approach, we currently expect to explore refinancing alternatives. Such alternatives may include incurring additional debt, issuing new equity securities and the sale of properties. We have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities. We may also seek to participate in joint ventures or other arrangements that may provide us additional sources of financing. We may also assume mortgage debt on properties we may acquire or obtain mortgage financing on our existing properties. 
 While we believe we will generally have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity, to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations, we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete any debt or equity offerings or other types of financings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will not increase. 
 Our ability to complete, and the costs associated with, future debt transactions depend primarily upon credit market conditions and our then perceived creditworthiness. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit ratings depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans, including our ability to maintain our earnings, to stagger our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably anticipated adverse changes. Similarly, our ability to raise equity capital in the future will depend primarily upon equity capital market conditions and our ability to conduct our business to maintain and grow our operating cash flows. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities. However, as discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the impacts of the current, and possibly future, inflationary conditions, increasing or sustained high interest rates and a possible economic recession are uncertain and may have various negative consequences on us and our operations, including a decline in financing availability and increased costs for financing. Further, such conditions could also disrupt the capital markets generally and limit our access to financing from public sources or on favorable terms, particularly if the global financial markets experience significant disruptions. 
 Debt Covenants 
 Our debt obligations at September 30, 2024 consisted of 5,075,000 aggregate principal amounts of senior notes and 607,101 aggregate principal amounts of mortgage notes secured by 308 net lease retail properties. For further information regarding our indebtedness, see Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents 

 Our publicly and privately issued senior notes are governed by our indentures and related supplements. These indentures and related supplements and our credit agreement contain covenants that generally restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts, and require us to maintain various financial ratios. Our credit agreement, net lease mortgage notes, secured senior notes and unsecured senior notes, indentures and their supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, which includes RMR ceasing to act as our business manager. As of September 30, 2024, we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our indentures and their supplements, net lease mortgage notes and our credit agreement.

 As of September 30, 2024, adjusted total assets for covenant purposes as defined in our senior notes indentures were 10,584,590 and assets encumbered under our revolving credit facility, serving as collateral for our net lease mortgage notes or secured senior notes represented 3,517,899 of adjusted total assets, as defined in our senior notes indentures. Our unencumbered hotels, travel centers, other net lease properties and other corporate assets represent 4,445,611, 1,599,434, 844,808 and 176,838 of adjusted total assets, respectively. 
 The following table presents the calculation of adjusted total assets to total assets in accordance with GAAP: 
 Total assets 7,086,792 Plus: accumulated depreciation 3,191,704 Plus: impairment and other adjustments to reflect original cost of real estate assets 526,093 Less: accounts receivable and intangibles (219,999) Adjusted total assets 10,584,590 
 Our ability to incur additional debt is subject to meeting the required covenant levels and subject to the provisions of our credit agreement and senior notes indentures. 
 Acceleration and Cross-Default 
 Our indentures and their supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debt of 50,000 or more. Similarly, our credit agreement has cross default provisions to other indebtedness that is recourse of 25,000 or more and indebtedness that is non-recourse of 75,000 or more. Neither our indentures and their supplements nor our credit agreement contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by a change in our debt ratings. 
 Supplemental Guarantor Information 
 Our 5.50 senior notes due 2027, or the 2027 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the 2032 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis and on a senior unsecured basis, by all of our subsidiaries, except for certain excluded subsidiaries, including our foreign subsidiaries and our subsidiaries pledged under our credit agreement and our net lease mortgage notes. The notes and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of our and the subsidiary guarantors secured indebtedness, respectively, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness, and will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities and any preferred equity of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Our remaining 2,425,000 of senior unsecured notes do not have the benefit of any guarantees. 
 A subsidiary guarantor s guarantee of the 2027 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the 2032 Notes and all other obligations of such subsidiary guarantor under the indentures governing the notes will automatically terminate and such subsidiary guarantor will automatically be released from all of its obligations under such subsidiary guarantee and such indenture under certain

 circumstances, including on or after the date on which (a) the notes have received a rating equal to or higher than Baa2 (or the equivalent) by Moody s Investor Services, or Moody s, or BBB (or the equivalent) by Standard Poor s Ratings Services, or S P, or if Moody s or S P ceases to rate the notes for reasons outside of our control, the equivalent investment grade rating from any other rating agency and (b) no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on these notes or the guarantees, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payments. The rights of holders of these notes to benefit from any of the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries are subject to the prior satisfaction of claims of those subsidiaries creditors and any preferred equity holders. As a result, these notes and the related guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of our and the subsidiary guarantors secured indebtedness, respectively, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness, and will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee these notes, including guarantees of or pledges under other indebtedness of ours, payment obligations under lease agreements, trade payables and preferred equity. 
 The following table presents summarized financial information for us and the subsidiary guarantors, on a combined basis, after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among us and the subsidiary guarantors, and (ii) equity in earnings from, and any investments in, any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries:

 Related Person Transactions 
 We have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with RMR, RMR Inc., TA and Sonesta and others related to them. For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 6, 10 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our 2023 Annual Report, our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In addition, see the section captioned Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report for a description of risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including businesses to which RMR or its subsidiaries provide management services. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the condensed consolidated financial statements include consolidation of VIEs, purchase price allocations, the determination of useful lives of fixed assets, classification of leases, and the assessment of the carrying values and impairment of real estate intangible assets and equity investments. 
 A discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in our 2023 Annual Report. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates since the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We present certain non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the applicable SEC rules, including funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of our liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We consider these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). We believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization expense, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. 
 Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations 
 We calculate FFO and Normalized FFO as shown below. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of real estate and loss on impairment of real estate assets, if any, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, less any gains on equity securities, as well as adjustments to reflect our share of FFO attributable to an investee and certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, we adjust for the items shown below. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our distribution rate as a percentage of the trading price of our common shares, or dividend yield, and to the dividend yield of other REITs, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance and our expected needs for and availability of cash to pay our obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do. 
 Our calculations of FFO and Normalized FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and reconciliations of net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements, to those amounts appear in the following table (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 
 We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives. Our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates has not materially changed since December 31, 2023. Other than as described below, we do not currently foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future. 
 Fixed Rate Debt 
 At September 30, 2024, our outstanding fixed rate debt consisted of the following: 
 Debt Principal Balance Annual Interest Rate Annual Interest Expense Maturity Interest Payments Due Senior unsecured notes 350,000 5.250 18,375 2026 Semi-Annually Senior unsecured notes 450,000 4.750 21,375 2026 Semi-Annually Senior unsecured notes 400,000 4.950 19,800 2027 Semi-Annually Senior guaranteed unsecured notes 
 450,000 5.500 24,750 2027 Semi-Annually Senior unsecured notes 400,000 3.950 15,800 2028 Semi-Annually Net lease mortgage notes 607,101 5.600 33,998 2028 Monthly Senior guaranteed unsecured notes 
 700,000 8.375 58,625 2029 Semi-Annually Senior unsecured notes 425,000 4.950 21,038 2029 Semi-Annually Senior unsecured notes 400,000 4.375 17,500 2030 Semi-Annually Senior secured notes 1,000,000 8.625 86,250 2031 Semi-Annually Senior guaranteed unsecured notes 
 500,000 8.875 44,375 2032 Semi-Annually 5,682,101 361,886 
 No principal repayments are due under our unsecured or secured senior notes until maturity. Our net lease mortgage notes require principal and interest payments through maturity pursuant to amortization schedules. Because these notes require interest at fixed rates, changes in market interest rates during the term of these debts will not affect our interest obligations. If these notes were refinanced at interest rates which are one percentage point higher than the rates shown above, our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately 56,821. Changes in market interest rates would affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations; increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt. In response to significant and prolonged increases in inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times since the beginning of 2022. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve has recently lowered interest rates and indicated that it may further lower interest rates in 2024, we cannot be sure that it will do so, and interest rates may remain at the current levels or increase. Based on the balances outstanding at September 30, 2024 and discounted cash flows analyses through the respective maturity dates, and assuming no other changes in factors that may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations, a hypothetical immediate one percentage point change in interest rates would change the fair value of those debt obligations by approximately 199,831. 
 Our fixed rate debt arrangements may allow us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date. In some cases, we are not allowed to make early repayment prior to a cutoff date and we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at a premium equal to a make whole amount, as defined, which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the noteholder. Also, we have in the past repurchased and retired some of our outstanding debts and we may do so again in the future. These prepayment rights and our ability to repurchase and retire outstanding debt may afford us opportunities to mitigate the risks of refinancing our debts at their maturities at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity. 
 Floating Rate Debt 
 At September 30, 2024, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is June 29, 2027, and, subject to our meeting certain conditions, including our payment of an extension fee, we have an option to extend the stated maturity date of the facility by two six-month periods. No principal repayments are required under our revolving credit facility prior to maturity and repayments may be made and redrawn subject to conditions at any time without penalty.

Table of Contents 

 Borrowings under our revolving credit facility are in U.S. dollars and require interest to be paid at a rate of SOFR plus premiums. Accordingly, we are vulnerable to changes in U.S. dollar based short term interest rates, specifically SOFR. In addition, upon renewal or refinancing of our revolving credit facility, we are vulnerable to increases in interest rate premiums due to market conditions or our perceived credit characteristics. Generally, a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results. 
 The following table presents the impact a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense at September 30, 2024 if we were fully drawn on our revolving credit facility: 
 Impact of Increase in Interest Rates Interest Rate 
 Per Year (1) 
 Outstanding Debt Total Interest Expense Per Year Annual Per 
 Share Impact (2) 
 At September 30, 2024 7.46 650,000 48,490 0.29 One percentage point increase 8.46 650,000 54,990 0.33 
 (1) Based on SOFR plus a premium, which was 250 basis points per annum, at September 30, 2024. 
 (2) Based on diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates as of September 30, 2024. If interest rates were to change gradually over time, the impact would be spread over time. Our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility or other floating rate debt, if any. Although we have no present plans to do so, we may in the future enter into hedge arrangements from time to time to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates.
