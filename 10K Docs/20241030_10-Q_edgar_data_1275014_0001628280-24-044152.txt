 of the shares of HIS, a privately held company based in Hillsboro, Oregon. HIS is a leading supplier to the semiconductor sub-fab segment including the design, manufacturing, and integration of components, process solutions, and fully integrated sub-systems. The acquisition strengthens the Company's leadership in developing and supplying critical products to the semiconductor industry, and extends our reach into the sub-fab area. 
 The purchase price of HIS for purposes of the Company s purchase price allocation was determined to be million, which includes initial cash consideration of million and the fair value of potential earn-out payments of approximately million. These potential earn-out payments represent up to million of cash consideration that may be payable based on the financial performance of the acquired business during the fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025. The fair value of the potential earn-out payments was determined utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model. 
 The Company has assigned the purchase price of HIS to the tangible assets, liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair value was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill associated with the acquisition is primarily attributable to the future technology, market presence and knowledgeable and experienced workforce. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired was determined using the income approach taking into account the Company s consideration of a number of inputs, including a third-party analysis that was based upon estimates and assumptions provided by the Company. These estimates and assumptions were determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques and with the assistance of a valuation specialist. 
 During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company completed the acquisition accounting and the valuation of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

 million and the fair value of the pension plan assets was million. The underfunded pension benefit obligations was million as of September 27, 2024. The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability. 
 The Company measures its contingent earn-out liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The significant unobservable inputs used in the model include the forecasted operating profit of the acquired business during each of calendar years 2024 and 2025. Significant increases or decreases to the forecasted results would result in a significantly higher or lower liability, with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings. The amount paid that is less than or equal to the contingent earn-out liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Any amount paid in excess of the contingent earn-out liability on the acquisition date will be reflected as cash used in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. For the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, the Company recorded ) million of loss and million of gain, respectively from change in the fair value of contingent earn-out related to the acquisition of HIS. This gain (loss) from change in the fair value was recognized as other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Intangible Assets 
 Intangible assets are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The Company evaluates the useful lives of its intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances require revising the remaining period of amortization. In addition, the Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and evaluates indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. Management considers such indicators as significant differences in product demand from the estimates, changes in the competitive and economic environment, technological advances, and changes in cost structure. Refer to Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies for additional information regarding impairment testing of intangible assets.

 The Company s Products business segment provides warranty on its products for a period of up to and provides for warranty costs at the time of sale based on historical activity. Determination of the warranty reserve requires the Company to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty. If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from these estimates, adjustments to recognize additional cost of revenues may be required in future periods. The warranty reserve is included in other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and is not considered significant. 
 The Company s products are manufactured and services provided at the Company's locations throughout the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe and the Middle East EMEA ). Sales to customers are initiated through a purchase order and are governed by our standard terms and conditions, written agreements, or both. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of an agreement with a customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the products or when the Company provides the services. Based on the enforceable rights included in our agreements or prevailing terms and conditions, products produced by the Company without an alternative use are not protected by an enforceable right of payment that includes a reasonable profit throughout the duration of the agreement. Consignment sales are recognized in revenue at the earlier of the period that the goods are consumed or after a period of time subsequent to receipt by the customer as specified by terms of the agreement, provided control of the promised goods or services has transferred. 
 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Sales, value-add, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Certain of our customers may receive cash-based incentives, such as rebates or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues recognized. Accruals for unpaid customer rebates of million and million as of September 27, 2024 and December 29, 2023, respectively, were netted against accounts receivable. The Company's disaggregated revenues are apportioned by segments within the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 Overview 
 Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc., UCT , the Company or We is a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems, components, parts, and ultra-high purity cleaning and analytical services primarily for the semiconductor industry. UCT offers its customers an integrated outsourced solution for major subassemblies, improved design-to-delivery cycle times, design for manufacturability, prototyping and part and component manufacturing, as well as tool chamber parts cleaning and coating, and micro-contamination analytical services. We report results for two segments: Products and Services. Our Products segment primarily designs, engineers and manufactures production tools, components and parts, and modules and subsystems for the semiconductor and display capital equipment markets. Products include chemical delivery modules, frame assemblies, gas delivery systems, fluid delivery systems, precision robotics, process modules as well as other high-level assemblies. Our Services segment provides ultra-high purity parts cleaning, process tool part recoating, surface encapsulation and high sensitivity micro contamination analysis primarily for the semiconductor device makers and wafer fabrication equipment WFE markets. 
 We ship a majority of our products and provide most of our services to U.S. registered customers with locations both in and outside the U.S. In addition to U.S. manufacturing and service operations, we manufacture products and provide parts cleaning and other related services in our Asia Pacific, Europe and Middle East EMEA facilities to support local and U.S. based customers. We conduct our operating activities primarily through our subsidiaries. 
 Over the long term, we believe the semiconductor market we serve will continue to grow due to multi-year industry demand from a broad range of drivers, such as new process architecture (e.g. gate all around) and memory devices (e.g. high bandwidth memory) necessary for cloud, artificial intelligence AI and machine learning ML applications. We also believe that semiconductor original equipment manufacturers OEM are increasingly relying on partners like UCT to fulfill their expanding capacity requirements. Additionally, our Services business is benefiting as device manufacturers rely on precision cleaning and coating to achieve ever more advanced devices. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, income taxes, business combinations, contingent earn-out liabilities and goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, accounting for income taxes, business combinations, valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each.

 Interest income increased 1.4 million in the nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances attributed to higher interest rates in the current period. 
 Interest expense was consistent in the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
 Other expense, net, increased 2.0 million in the three months ended September 27, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a loss from the change in the fair value of contingent earn-out of 0.8 million and by 1.3 million of unfavorable foreign exchange transactions and remeasurements. Other income, net, increased 10.1 million in the nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the gain from the change in a fair value of contingent earn-out of 22.0 million offset partially by the 3.6 million of debt financing costs and by the 8.7 million unfavorable foreign exchange transactions and remeasurements.

 The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year is primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of worldwide earnings and financial results in jurisdictions which are taxed at different rates and the impact of losses in jurisdictions with full valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. The negative tax rates in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 were the result of pre-tax losses in those periods compared to pre-tax profits in the comparable periods ended September 27, 2024. 
 Company management continuously evaluates the need for a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets and, as of September 27, 2024, concluded that a full valuation allowance on its U.S. federal, state and certain of its foreign deferred tax assets remained appropriate.

 Our primary cash inflows and outflows were as follows: 
 For the nine months ended September 27, 2024, we generated cash from operating activities of 47.9 million compared to 100.6 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023. The 52.7 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by a 83.1 million unfavorable change in net working capital and by a 4.7 million decrease in non-cash items included in net income offset in part by an increase in net income of 35.1 million. 
 The major contributors in net changes in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 were as follows: 
 Accounts receivable increased 47.3 million primarily due to the timing of shipments and collections and 28.1 million increase in inventories due to increased production levels. 
 Accounts payable increased 46.1 million, income taxes payable increased 1.4 million, and accrued compensation and related benefits increased 0.2 million, primarily due to the timing of payments. 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 consisted primarily of 46.2 million and 59.2 million purchases of property, plant and equipment, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 27, 2024, the cash provided in financing activities was 8.8 million compared to cash used in financing activities of 61.0 million in the nine months ended September 29, 2023. The 69.8 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities is due to the 23.5 million net cash proceeds from the amended credit agreement, a decrease of 24.6 million in principal payments on bank borrowings, and a 23.7 million decrease in share repurchases offset partially by the additional 2.2 million payment of debt issuance costs. 
 We believe we have sufficient capital to fund our working capital needs, satisfy our debt obligations, maintain our existing capital equipment, purchase new capital equipment and make strategic acquisitions from time to time. As of September 27, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 318.2 million compared to 307.0 million as of December 29, 2023. Our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and amounts available under our revolving line of credit described below were our principal sources of liquidity as of September 27, 2024. 
 Fluid Solutions has an existing factoring arrangement with a financial institution in which a portion of its accounts receivable are sold on a non-recourse basis. As of September 27, 2024, Fluid Solutions factored 7.6 million under this arrangement. 
 We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance and operating cash flow will be sufficient to service our indebtedness and meet our working capital requirements and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months. The adequacy of these resources to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, the size and number of any acquisitions, the state of the worldwide economy, our ability to meet our financial covenants with our credit facility, the cyclical expansion or contraction of the semiconductor capital equipment industry and the other industries we serve and capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products. 
 In order to expand our business or acquire additional complementary businesses or technologies, we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. If required, additional financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders equity interest will be diluted and these securities might have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders. We may also require the consent of our new lenders to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that, if available, such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us. 
 As of September 27, 2024, we have cash of approximately 278.3 million in our foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the tax liability that might be incurred if the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were to be distributed. For undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are not considered indefinitely reinvested, deferred taxes have been accrued.

 Capital Expenditures 
 Capital expenditures were 46.2 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and were primarily attributable to the capital invested in our manufacturing facilities worldwide. The Company s anticipated capital expenditures for the remainder of 2024 are expected to be financed primarily from our cash flow generated from operations and cash on hand. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The Company had commitments to various third parties to purchase inventories totaling approximately 495.7 million as of September 27, 2024. 
 In conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business, we provide standard indemnification against certain liabilities to our customers, which may include claims of losses by their own customers resulting out of property damages, bodily injuries or deaths, or infringement of intellectual property rights by our products. Our potential liability arising out of intellectual property infringement claims by any third party is generally uncapped. As of September 27, 2024, we have not incurred any significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements. As a result, we believe the estimated fair value of these arrangements is minimal.

 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There were no significant changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the period covered by this report. Refer to Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2023, for a more complete discussion of the market risks we encounter. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 27, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023, the Company identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that continue to exist as of September 27, 2024. 
 The Company did not design and maintain effective controls relating to the: (i) sufficiency of processes related to identifying and analyzing risks to the achievement of objectives across the entity, (ii) sufficiency of competent personnel to analyze risks of material misstatement and develop internal control activities to support the achievement of the Company s internal control objectives; and (iii) monitoring of performance of control activities in accordance with established policies in a timely manner. 
 These material weaknesses contributed to the following additional material weaknesses: 
 (a) The Company did not design and maintain effective information technology IT general controls for certain information systems that are relevant to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Specifically, for certain of the Fluid Solutions operating subsidiaries in the Products segment which have not been migrated to the Company s primary ERP system, the Company did not design and maintain (a) program change management controls to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately, and (b) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties that adequately restrict user and privileged access to our financial applications and data to appropriate company personnel. Business process controls that are dependent on information and data produced by systems affected by the deficiencies in IT general controls were deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. 
 (b) The Company did not design and maintain effective application controls over certain information technology systems that are relevant to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Specifically, for certain other international operating subsidiaries in the Products segment which have not been migrated to the Company s primary ERP system, the Company did not design and maintain effective IT application controls or business process controls including, but not limited to appropriate segregation of duties. The business process controls were deemed ineffective because they could have allowed for certain personnel to have incompatible duties allowing for the creation, review, and processing of certain transactions without independent review and authorization which affects substantially all financial statement account balances and disclosures within such subsidiaries; 
 (c) The Company did not design and maintain effective controls to determine the valuation of inventories, including the write down of inventory to its estimated market value less costs to sell and the validation and approval of inventory costing; 
 (d) The Company did not design effective controls necessary to validate the accuracy of certain data used within the operation of controls which affects substantially all financial statement account balances and disclosures; and

Table of Contents 

 (e) The Company did not design and maintain effective controls related to the review of cash flow forecasts used in the valuation of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. Specifically, the control activities related to the review of the inputs and assumptions utilized to develop the cash flow forecasts used in the valuation of acquired intangible assets and contingent earn-out liabilities were not designed at an appropriate level of precision. 
 The material weaknesses described above did not result in any changes to previously released annual or interim financial results. However, these material weaknesses could result in misstatements of our consolidated financial statements that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Based on additional procedures and post-closing review, management concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 Remediation Plan and Progress 
 Management has been executing and remains committed to implementing measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. 
 In response to all material weaknesses, management has taken the following actions: 
 engaged an external advisor to assist with evaluating and documenting the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls and to assist with the remediation of deficiencies, as necessary; 
 hired additional IT, accounting, and finance personnel to support our remediation efforts, including a Vice President of Internal Audit, as well as third-party resources with relevant expertise to augment our internal resources; 
 formalized roles and responsibilities within the organization to establish ownership of workstreams to identify and analyze risks of material misstatement, develop internal control activities to support the achievement of the Company s internal control objectives, and monitor the effective performance of those control objectives; 
 performed an entity-wide risk assessment of information technology systems and business processes by operating subsidiary; and 
 assessed the specific training needs for newly hired and existing personnel and developed and delivered training programs designed to support our internal controls. 
 In response to the material weakness (a) management has taken the following actions: 
 in process of designing and implementing change management and user access review controls for relevant information technology systems at certain Fluid Solutions operating subsidiaries not yet migrated to our primary ERP system. Management also continues to design and implement user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties that adequately restrict user access to our financial applications and data to appropriate company personnel. 
 In response to the material weakness (b) management has taken the following actions: 
 in process of completing a segregation of duties assessment to identify key conflicts, establishing policies and procedures to maintain effective segregation of duties, and identifying mitigating factors for any key conflicts identified for certain other international operating subsidiaries in the Products segment which have not been migrated to the Company s primary ERP system and 
 in process of identifying and evaluating the effectiveness of key IT dependencies, including automated application controls for certain other international operating subsidiaries in the Products segment which have not been migrated to the Company s primary ERP system. 
 In response to the material weakness (c) management has taken the following actions: 
 designed and implemented controls over valuation of inventories, including review and assessment of the methodology for the valuation of inventories, including the write down of inventory to its estimated market value less costs to sell and 
 designed and implemented controls over validation and approval of inventory costing, including capitalizing variances from standard costs. 
 In response to the material weakness (d) management has taken the following actions: 
 - 32 - 

Table of Contents 

 established ongoing education and training of control owners on how to assess the accuracy and completeness of relevant data used within the operation of controls, including the adequate levels of evidence and documentation required to support such procedures 
 designed and implemented an additional control to validate the accuracy of certain data used within the operation of controls and 
 ensured the design of all business process controls include a control activity to assess the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the operation of controls and to ensure adequate levels of evidence and documentation to support assessment of data used within the operation of controls. 
 In response to the material weakness (e) management has taken the following actions: 
 designed and implemented effective controls over the review of cash flow forecasts utilized in the valuation of contingent earn-out liabilities including review of the inputs and assumptions utilized to develop the cash flow forecasts at an appropriate level of precision and 
 designed controls that stand ready to operate in a future business combination to review the inputs and assumptions utilized to develop the cash flow forecasts in the valuation of intangible assets at an appropriate level of precision. 
 As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may decide to take additional measures to address the material weaknesses or modify the remediation plans described above. We believe that these actions will remediate the material weaknesses, however the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until we conclude all measures necessary to remediate the material weaknesses have been designed, implemented, and the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively. While Management believes that the aforementioned plans will remediate the material weaknesses, there is no assurance on the exact timing of the completion of the remediation. As the remediation plans continue to be implemented, management may be required to take additional measures or modify the plan elements. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the remediation measures described above, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 27, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings
