 The acquired technology, trade names, and customer relationship intangible assets have a weighted-average estimated useful lives of years, years, and years , respectively. 
 
 The fair value of the acquired technology and trade name was determined using the relief from royalty RFR method. The fair value of the acquired customer relationships was determined using the excess earnings method. 
 
 The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, whereby the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets was allocated to goodwill. The goodwill reflects the potential synergies and expansion of the Company s offerings across product lines and markets complementary to its existing products and markets. For tax purposes, the goodwill related to the acquisition is deductible. 
 
 The results of operations of Pangiam for the period from February 29, 2024 to September 30, 2024 have been included in the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The post-acquisition net revenues and net loss included in the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were million and million, respectively.

million non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our goodwill impairment test reflected an allocation of and between the income and market-based approaches, respectively. Significant inputs into the valuation models included the discount rate, EBITDA growth and estimated future cash flows. We used a discount rate of , guideline peer group and the historical and forward-looking revenue of the peer group in the goodwill impairment test. Subsequent to the impairment, there was excess of reporting unit fair value over carrying value. 
 
 Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 
 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we reevaluated our long-term forecasts due to changes in our expectations about the timing of forecasted revenues for one of our higher growth products. We concluded that the revision to the Company s forecasts constituted a triggering event and therefore performed a qualitative impairment analysis as of September 30, 2024. Due to the combination of changes to our forecasts and lack of headroom resulting from our goodwill impairment during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we could not conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeded the carrying value of our reporting unit as of September 30, 2024 and therefore performed a quantitative interim impairment test. 
 
 Our quantitative goodwill impairment test reflected an allocation of and between the income and market-based approaches, respectively. Significant inputs into the valuation models included the discount rate, EBITDA growth and estimated future cash flows. We used a discount rate of , guideline peer group and the historical and forward-looking revenue of the peer group in the goodwill impairment test. It was determined that there was no impairment for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Because the fair value of the reporting unit approximated its carrying value, a negative change in the key assumptions used in the interim impairment analysis or an increase in the carrying value may result in a future impairment of goodwill. Any significant adverse changes in future periods to our internal forecasts or external market conditions could reasonably be expected to negatively affect our key assumptions and may result in future goodwill impairment charges which could be material. For example, keeping all other assumptions the same, an additional increase in the discount rate or an increase in the carrying value could result in an impairment of goodwill. 
 
 First Quarter of Fiscal 2023 
 
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company assessed if the reorganization described in Note 3 was potentially masking a goodwill impairment by performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test of the Company s reporting units immediately before and after the reorganization. Our goodwill impairment test reflected an allocation of and between the income and market-based approaches, respectively. Significant inputs into the valuation models included the discount rate, EBITDA growth and estimated future cash flows. We used a discount rate of , guideline peer group and the historical and forward-looking revenue of the peer group in the goodwill impairment test. The fair value of the Company s reporting units immediately before and after the reorganization exceeded its carrying values.

 Following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if the Company exercises its mandatory conversion right in connection with such corporate events, the conversion rate will be increased in certain circumstances for a holder who elects, or has been forced, to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such corporate events. 
 
 If a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Convertible Notes indenture) occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of their Convertible Notes in principal amounts of dollars or an integral multiple thereof, at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

As a result of the Second Amendment, funds available under the Senior Revolver are reduced to million from million, limited to a borrowing base of of Eligible Prime Government Receivables and Eligible Subcontractor Government Receivables, plus of Eligible Commercial Receivables. Additionally, the Second Amendment increased the Base Rate Margin, BSBY Margin and unused commitment fees by . Following entry into the Second Amendment, the Senior Revolver no longer is subject to a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage ratio covenant, but is still subject to the Secured Net Leverage ratio covenant. In order for the facility to become available for borrowings (the initial availability quarter ), the Company must report Adjusted EBITDA of at least one dollar. Commencing on the first fiscal quarter after the initial availability quarter, the Company is required to have aggregate reported Adjusted EBITDA of at least dollar over the two preceding quarters to maintain its ability to borrow under the Senior Revolver (though the inability to satisfy such condition does not result in a default under the Senior Revolver). Failure to meet this Adjusted EBITDA requirement is not a default but limits the Company s ability to make borrowings under the Senior Revolver until such time that the Company is able meet the Adjusted EBITDA threshold as defined in the Second Amendment. 
 
 The Bank of America Credit Agreement requires the Company to meet certain financial and other covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenant requirements. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not drawn on the Senior Revolver. Unamortized debt issuance costs of million as of September 30, 2024, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and are presented in other non-current assets. The Bank of America Credit Agreement requires the Company to deliver monthly borrowing base certificates. The Company did not deliver such monthly borrowing base certificates for the months ending December 31, 2022, January 31, 2023, February 28, 2023, and March 31, 2023. Bank of America N.A. notified the Company of the reporting violation, and on April 21, 2023, Bank of America N.A. and the Company entered into the Third Amendment (the Third Amendment to the Bank of America Credit Agreement, which, among other things, waived the requirement that the Company deliver the monthly borrowing base certificate for the months ending December 31, 2022, January 31, 2023, February 28, 2023, and March 31, 2023, and removed the reporting requirement to deliver a monthly borrowing base certificate going forward until the Company meets the Adjusted EBITDA requirements set forth above and is permitted to draw on the Senior Revolver.

Once the event occurs, unrecognized compensation cost associated with the performance-vesting Incentive Units (based on their modification date fair value) will be recognized based on the portion of the requisite service period that has been rendered. 
 
 The modification date fair value of the Incentive Units was per unit.

The 2024 PIPE warrant will become exercisable commencing at any time on or after September 5, 2024 (the Exercise Date ), expiring after five years, with an exercise price per share equal to 4.75. 
 
 U.S. Budget Environment 
 
 The majority of our revenue is derived from federal government contracts. U.S. government spending levels, particularly defense spending, and timely funding thereof can affect our financial performance over the short and long term. We expect our key contracts will continue to be supported and funded under the continuing resolution. However, during periods covered by continuing resolutions, we may experience delays in new contract awards, and those delays may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 On March 22, 2024, the President signed the second Fiscal Year FY 2024 Consolidated Appropriations package into law, which includes Department of Defense DoD funding. This legislation reflects the Fiscal Responsibility Act FRA spending limit of 886 billion for National Defense, of which 842 billion was for the DoD base budget. 
 
 The President s FY 2025 budget request was submitted to Congress on March 11, 2024, initiating the FY 2025 defense authorization and appropriations legislative process. The request included 895 billion for National Defense, of which 850 billion is for the DoD base budget, in keeping with the limit established by the FRA. While compression on overall requirements driven by the FRA limit is evident, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has stated the FY 2025 budget proposal meets their objectives of keeping National Defense Strategy priorities on track. 
 
 In the coming months, Congress will need to approve or revise the President s FY 2025 budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final approval from the President in order for the FY 2025 budget process to conclude. A Continuing Resolution (CR) passed the House and Senate on September 25, 2024 and was signed by the President on September 26, 2024. The bill funds U.S. Government operations through December 20, 2024. After the November 2024 election, Congress will return to the task of funding the U.S. Government for the balance of the FY 2025. Significant differences that must be resolved include the different allocations as noted above and policy matters that arose during consideration of the CR and the underlying bills. 
 
 We anticipate the federal budget will continue to be subject to debate and compromise shaped by, among other things, heightened

 political tensions and the 2024 elections, the global security environment, inflationary pressures, and macroeconomic conditions. The result may be shifting funding priorities, which could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and on our federal government contracts, which may affect the Company s projected revenue and results of operation. 
 
 Geopolitical Environment 
 
 We operate in a complex and evolving security environment and our business is affected by geopolitical issues. Conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and heightened tension in the Pacific region have elevated global geopolitical tensions and security concerns. For our government customers, their focus on addressing immediate needs in these regions has slowed the pipeline and pace of contract awards, pushing revenue into subsequent periods. We continue to expect the geopolitical climate to drive adoption of our offerings over the long term, as it has heightened the need for advanced AI tools that provide enhanced intelligence and full spectrum cyber operations areas where we have unmatched capabilities. While these conflicts are still evolving and the eventual outcome remains highly uncertain, we do not believe that these events will have a material impact on our business and results of operations. However, if these conflicts worsen, leading to greater disruptions and uncertainty within the technology industry or global economy, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Information 
 The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for interest expense (incom e), income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation and associated employer payroll taxes, net increase in fair value of derivatives, restructuring charges, non-recurring strategic initiatives, non-recurring litigation, transaction expenses, goodwill impairment, non-recurring integration costs, capital market advisory fees, commercial start-up costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, transaction bonuses, termination of legacy benefits and management fees. Non-GAAP financial performance measures are used to sup plement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the relevant GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with information presented on a GAAP basis. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Key Performance Indicators 
 
 Backlog 
 
 We view growth in backlog as a key measure of our business growth. Backlog represents the estimated dollar value of contracts that we have been awarded for which work has not yet been performed, and in certain cases, our estimate of known opportunities for future contract awards on customer programs that we are currently supporting. 
 
 The majority of our historical revenues are derived from contracts with the Federal Government and its various agencies. In accordance with the general procurement practices of the Federal Government, most contracts are not fully funded at the time of contract award. As work under the contract progresses, our customers may add incremental funding up to the initial contract award amount. We generally do not deliver goods and services to our customers in excess of the appropriated contract funding. 
 
 At the time of award, certain contracts may include options for our customers to procure additional goods and services under the contract. Options do not create enforceable rights and obligations until exercised by our customers and thus we only recognize revenues related to options as each option is exercised. Contracts with such provisions may or may not specify the exact scope, nor corresponding price, associated with options; however, these contracts will generally identify the expected period of performance for each option. In cases where we have negotiated the estimated scope and price of an option in the contract with our customer, we use that information to measure our backlog and we refer to this as Priced Unexercised Options. If a contract does not specify the scope, level-of-effort, or price related to options to procure additional goods and services, we estimate the backlog associated with those options based on our discussions with our customer, our current level of support on the customer s program, and the period of performance for each option that was negotiated in the contract. We refer to this as Unpriced Unexercised Options. 
 
 We define backlog in these categories to provide the reader with additional context as to the nature of our backlog and so that the reader can understand the varying degrees of risk, uncertainty, and where applicable, management s estimates and judgements used in determining backlog at the end of a period. The categories of backlog are further defined below. 
 
 Funded Backlog. Funded backlog represents the contract value of goods and services to be delivered under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. 
 
 Unfunded backlog. Unfunded backlog represents the contract value, or portion thereof, of goods and services to be delivered under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized. 
 
 Priced Unexercised Options. Priced unexercised contract options represent the value of goods and services to be delivered under existing contracts if our customer elects to exercise all of the options available in the contract. For priced unexercised options, we measure backlog based on the corresponding contract values assigned to the options as negotiated in our contract with our customer. 
 
 Unpriced Unexercised Options. Unpriced unexercised contract options represent the value of goods and services to be delivered under existing contracts if our customer elects to exercise all of the options available in the contract. For unpriced unexercised options, we estimate backlog generally under the assumption that our current level of support on the contract will persist for each option period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by our operations and access to existing credit facilities, if available. Our primary short-term cash requirements are to fund payroll obligations, working capital, operating lease obligations, interest payments and short-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt. Working capital requirements can vary significantly from period to period, particularly as a result of the timing of receipts and disbursements related to long-term contracts. As more fully described below under Bank of America Senior Revolver, as of September 30, 2024, until such date as we are able to comply with the Adjusted EBITDA requirement under the Senior Revolver, we are unable to draw on the Senior Revolver. However, based on our projected cash flow and liquidity needs, we believe that our cash from operating activities generated from continuing operations during the year will be adequate for the next 12 months to meet our anticipated uses of cash flow. 
 
 Our medium-term to long-term cash requirements are to service and repay debt and to invest in facilities, equipment, technologies, and research and development for growth initiatives. 
 
 Our ability to fund our medium-term to long-term cash needs will depend, in part, on our ability to generate cash in the future, which depends on our future financial results. Our future results are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors that may be outside of our control. Our future access to, and the availability of credit on acceptable terms and conditions, is impacted by many factors, including capital market liquidity and overall economic conditions. 
 
 On May 10, 2024, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering sales agreement (the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co., as sales agent (the sales agent ), pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 150.0 million through the sales agent under an at-the-market equity offering program. Any offer and sale of shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement will be made pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-271230), which was declared effective by the SEC on April 21, 2023, and the related prospectus supplement dated May 10, 2024 and accompanying prospectus that form a part of the registration statement. 
 
 As described in Note 10 Debt to consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the Senior Revolver as of September 30, 2024 but is currently unable to draw on the Senior Revolver based on the Adjusted EBITDA requirements pursuant to the credit agreement. 
 
 While we intend to reduce debt over time using cash provided by operations, we may also attempt to meet long-term debt obligations, if necessary, by obtaining capital from a variety of additional sources or by refinancing existing obligations. These sources include public or private capital markets, bank financings, proceeds from dispositions or other third-party sources. 
 
 Our available liquidity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , consisted primarily of available cash and cash equivalents, which were as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Available cash and cash equivalents 65,584 32,557 Available borrowings from our existing credit facilities (1) 
 Total available liquidity 
 65,584 32,557 
 (1) Pursuant to the credit agreement, if the Company is compliance with the Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant and the Adjusted EBITDA requirement as further described in Note 10 Debt, the Company is eligible to borrow up to 25 million, which is subject to borrowing base adjustments that limit the total amount available under the credit facilities to 90 of Eligible Prime Government Receivables and Eligible Subcontractor Government Receivables, plus 85 of Eligible Commercial Receivables.

 Convertible Notes 
 
 On December 7, 2021, the Company issued 200.0 million of unsecured convertible notes (the Convertible Notes to certain investors. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.0 per annum, payable semi-annually, and not including any interest payments that are settled with the issuance of shares, were convertible into 17,391,304 shares of the Company s common stock at an initial Conversion Price of 11.50. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustments, including but not limited to, the Conversion Rate Reset described below and in Note 10 Debt of the Notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q . The Convertible Notes mature on December 15, 2026. 
 
 On May 29, 2022, pursuant to the conversion rate adjustment provisions in the Convertible Notes indenture, the Conversion Price was adjusted to 10.61 (or 94.2230 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes) because the average of the daily volume-weighted average price of the common stock during the preceding 30 trading days was less than 10.00 (the Conversion Rate Reset ). Subsequent to the Conversion Rate Reset, the Convertible Notes are convertible into 18,844,600 shares, not including any interest payments that are settled with the issuance of shares. 
 
 The Convertible Notes require the Company to meet certain financial and other covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Convertible Notes. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has an outstanding balance of 200.0 million related to the Convertible Notes, which is recorded on the balance sheet net of approximately 4.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
 
 Bank of America Senior Revolver 
 
 BigBear.ai is a party to a senior Bank of America Credit Agreement, entered into on December 7, 2021, subsequently amended on November 8, 2022, providing BigBear.ai with a 25.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Senior Revolver ). Proceeds from the Senior Revolver will be used to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. The Senior Revolver matures on December 7, 2025. 
 
 The Senior Revolver includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as the swing loans. Any issuance of letters of credit or making of a swing loan will reduce the amount available under the revolving credit facility. BigBear.ai may increase the commitments under the Senior Revolver in an aggregate amount of up to the greater of 25.0 million or 100 of consolidated adjusted EBITDA plus any additional amounts so long as certain conditions, including compliance with the applicable financial covenants for such period, in each case on a pro forma basis, are satisfied. 
 
 The Bank of America Credit Agreement requires BigBear.ai to meet certain financial and other covenants. The Company was not in compliance with the Fixed Charge Coverage ratio requirement as of June 30, 2022, and as a result was unable to draw on the facility. The Company notified Bank of America N.A. of the covenant violation, and on August 9, 2022, entered into the First Amendment, which among other things, waived the requirement that the Company demonstrate compliance with the minimum Fixed Charge Coverage ratio provided for in the Credit Agreement for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. 
 
 The Company was not in compliance with the Fixed Charge Coverage ratio requirement as of September 30, 2022, and as a result was unable to draw on the facility. On November 8, 2022, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Bank of America Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment ), which modifies key terms of the Senior Revolver. As a result of the Second Amendment, funds available under the Senior Revolver are reduced to 25.0 million from 50.0 million, limited to a 
 42

 borrowing base of 90 of Eligible Prime Government Receivables and Eligible Subcontractor Government Receivables, plus 85 of Eligible Commercial Receivables. Additionally, the Second Amendment increased the Base Rate Margin, BSBY Margin and unused commitment fees by 0.25 . Following entry into the Second Amendment, the Senior Revolver no longer is subject to a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage ratio covenant, but is still subject to the Secured Net Leverage ratio covenant. In order for the facility to become available for borrowings (the initial availability quarter ), the Company must report Adjusted EBITDA of at least one dollar. Commencing on the first fiscal quarter after the initial availability quarter, the Company is required to have aggregated reported Adjusted EBITDA of at least 1 over the two preceding quarters to maintain its ability to borrow under the Senior Revolver (though the inability to satisfy such condition does not result in a default under the Senior Revolver). Failure to meet this Adjusted EBITDA requirement is not a default but limits the Company s ability to make borrowings under the Senior Revolver until such time that the Company is able to meet the Adjusted EBITDA thresholds as defined in the Second Amendment. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not drawn on the Senior Revolver. Unamortized debt issuance costs of 0.1 million were recorded on the balance sheet and are presented in Other non-current assets. 
 
 Refer to Note 10 Debt to consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. 
 
 D O Financing Loan 
 
 On December 20, 2023, the Company entered into a 1.2 million loan (the 2024 D O Financing Loan with US Premium Finance to finance the Company s directors and officers insurance premium through September 2024. The D O Financing Loan had an interest rate of 6.99 per annum and a maturity date of September 8, 2024. 
 
 On December 8, 2022, the Company entered into a 2.1 million loan (the 2023 D O Financing Loan with AFCO Credit Corporation to finance the Company s directors and officers insurance premium through December 2023. The 2023 D O Financing Loan required an upfront payment of 1.1 million and has an interest rate of 5.75 per annum and a maturity date of December 8, 2023. The 2023 D O Financing Loan was fully repaid at maturity. 
 
 RDO Warrant Exercise 
 
 On February 27, 2024, the Company entered into a warrant exercise agreement with an existing accredited investor to exercise in full the outstanding RDO warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 8,886,255 shares of the Company s common stock for total gross proceeds of approximately 20.6 million, prior to deducting offering expenses. 
 
 PIPE Warrant Exercise 
 
 On March 4, 2024, the Company entered into a warrant exercise agreement with an existing accredited investor to exercise in full the outstanding PIPE warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 13,888,889 shares of the Company s common stock for total gross proceeds of approximately 33.2 million, prior to deducting offering expenses. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The table below summarizes certain information from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the following periods:

 Operating activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 23.3 million. Net loss before deducting depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items was 22.2 million and was further impacted by an unfavorable change in net working capital of 1.2 million which contributed to operating cash flows during this period. The unfavorable change in net working capital was largely driven by an increase in accounts receivable of 5.4 million, a decrease in accounts payable of 8.2 million and a decrease in other liabilities of 0.2 million. These were partially offset by a decrease in contract assets of 3.1 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of 1.5 million, an increase in accrued liabilities of 7.6 million, and an increase in contract liabilities of 0.5 million. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 18.2 million. Net loss before deducting depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items was 18.9 million and was further impacted by an unfavorable change in net working capital of 0.7 million, which contributed to operating cash flows during this period. The unfavorable change in net working capital was largely driven by a decrease in accounts payable of 6.3 million and increases in other liabilities of 1.8 million and accounts receivable of 0.5 million. These were partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of 6.2 million, a decrease in contract assets of 0.9 million, and an increase in accrued liabilities of 2.0 million. 
 
 Investing activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 6.2 million, primarily consisting of cash acquired from the Pangiam Acquisition of 13.9 million, partially offset by capitalized software development costs of 7.4 million. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 2.7 million, primarily due to capitalization of software development costs of 2.7 million and the purchase of property and equipment. 
 
 Financing activities 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 50.2 million, primarily consisting of the net proceeds from the issuance of shares pursuant to the exercise of the PIPE warrants and RDO warrants of 53.8 million, partially offset by the payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards 3.1 million and the net repayment of 1.2 million related to the 2023 D O Financing Loan. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 40.5 million, primarily consisting of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Private Placement and Registered Direct Offering shares of 50.0 million, offset by the payment of transaction costs associated with the Private Placement and Registered Direct Offering of 5.7 million, the payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards 2.2 million, and partial repayment of 2.1 million related to the 2023 D O Financing Loan. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 For the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on revenue and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations , as well as, on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 In addition to those outlined for goodwill below, our critical accounting estimates are disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2023 , as filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024 . 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of October 1, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. For the purposes of impairment testing, we have determined that we have one reporting unit. Our test of goodwill impairment starts with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If qualitative factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. 
 44 

Table of Contents 

The discounted cash flow approach requires management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. Actual results could differ from these assumptions. We believe the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering current economic conditions. 
 
 Additional risks for goodwill across all reporting units include, but are not limited to: 
 
 our failure to reach our internal forecasts could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted value of our reporting units; 
 adverse technological events that could impact our performance; 
 volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and 
 significant adverse changes in the regulatory environment or markets in which we operate. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment Testing 
 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we reevaluated our long-term forecasts due to changes in our expectations about the timing of forecasted revenues for one of our higher growth products. We concluded that the revision to the Company s forecasts constituted a triggering event and therefore performed a qualitative impairment analysis as of September 30, 2024. Due to the combination of changes to our forecasts and lack of headroom resulting from our goodwill impairment during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we could not conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeded the carrying value of our reporting unit as of September 30, 2024 and therefore performed a quantitative interim impairment test. 
 
 Our quantitative goodwill impairment test reflected an allocation of 50 and 50 between the income and market-based approaches, respectively. Significant inputs into the valuation models included the discount rate, EBITDA growth and estimated future cash flows. We used a discount rate of 12.0 , guideline peer group and the historical and forward-looking revenue of the peer group in the goodwill impairment test. It was determined that there was no impairment for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Because the fair value of the reporting unit approximated its carrying value, a negative change in the key assumptions used in the interim impairment analysis or an increase in the carrying value may result in a future impairment of goodwill. Any significant adverse changes in future periods to our internal forecasts or external market conditions could reasonably be expected to negatively affect our key assumptions and may result in future goodwill impairment charges which could be material. For example, keeping all other assumptions the same, an additional increase in the discount rate or an increase in the carrying value could result in an impairment of goodwill. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Our main exposure to market risk relates to changes in the value of our common stock or other instruments that are tied to our common stock, including derivative liabilities and convertible debt. Decreases in the value of our common stock have triggered certain reset provisions in our Convertible Notes that are based on the value of our common stock and volume of shares traded during the reset period. On May 29, 2022, pursuant to the Convertible Note indenture, the conversion rate applicable to the Convertible Notes was adjusted to 94.2230 (previously 86.9565) shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes because the average of the daily volume-weighted average price of the common stock during the preceding 30 trading days was less than 10.00 (the Conversion Rate Reset ). After giving effect to the Conversion Rate Reset, the conversion price is 10.61 and the Convertible Notes are convertible into 18,844,600 shares, not including any interest payments that are settled with the issuance of shares. In addition, the Convertible Notes indenture contains certain make-whole provisions pursuant to which, under certain circumstances, the Company must increase the conversion rate and such increase depends, in part, on the price of our common stock. Refer to Written Put Option and Note 10 Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1 on this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 
 We are also exposed to market risk related to interest rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and revolving credit, if drawn. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal amount of our long-term debt was 200.0 million excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of 4.3 million.

 Inflation affects the way we operate in our target markets. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability. Additionally, many of our long-term contracts have annual rate escalation clauses. 
 
 We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and to manage and mitigate our exposure to these risks. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are subject to litigation, claims, investigations and audits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Although legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, we intend to vigorously defend against any matters currently pending against us. The outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 For a discussion of the material factors that make an investment in the Company risky, please see the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, projected results and future prospects. These risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject include the factors mentioned under Forward-Looking Statements and the risks described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
