CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Form 10-Q") contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical fact, and given our expectations or forecasts of future events as of the effective date of this Form 10-Q. Words such as "may," "could," "plan," "project," "budget," "predict," "target," "seek," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "will," "should," "continue" and similar expressions are generally used to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to statements about our business strategy, industry, future profitability, future capital expenditures, our fleet conversion strategy and our share repurchase program. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include: 
 
 changes in general economic and geopolitical conditions, including as a result of 2024 presidential election, higher interest rates, the rate of inflation and a potential economic recession; 
 central bank policy actions, bank failures and associated liquidity risks and other factors; 
 the severity and duration of any world events and armed conflict, including the Russian-Ukraine war, conflicts in the Israel-Gaza region and continued hostilities in the Middle East, including rising tensions with Iran, and associated repercussions to supply and demand for oil and gas and the economy generally; 
 the actions taken by the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC") and Russia (together with OPEC and other allied producing countries, "OPEC+") with respect to oil production levels and announcements of potential changes in such levels, including the ability of the OPEC+ countries to agree on and comply with supply limitations; 
 actions taken by the current government, such as executive orders or new regulations, including climate-related regulations, that may negatively impact the future production of oil and natural gas in the United States and may adversely affect our future operations; 
 the level of production and resulting market prices for crude oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons; 
 the effects of existing and future laws and governmental regulations (or the interpretation thereof) on us, our suppliers and our customers; 
 cost increases and supply chain constraints related to our services, including any delays and/or supply chain disruptions due to increased hostilities in the Middle East; 
 competitive conditions in our industry; 
 our ability to attract and retain employees; 
 changes in the long-term supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas; 
 actions taken by our customers, suppliers, competitors and third-party operators and the possible loss of customers or work to our competitors; 
 technological changes, including lower emissions oilfield service equipment and similar advancements; 
 changes in the availability and cost of capital; 
 our ability to successfully implement our business plan, including execution of potential mergers and acquisitions; 
 large or multiple customer defaults, including defaults resulting from actual or potential insolvencies; 
 the effects of consolidation on our customers or competitors; 
 the price and availability of debt and equity financing (including higher interest rates) for us and our customers; 
 our ability to complete growth projects on time and on budget; 
 increases in tax rates or types of taxes enacted that specifically impact exploration and production ("E P") and related operations resulting in changes in the amount of taxes owed by us; 
 -ii- 

regulatory and related policy actions intended by federal, state and/or local governments to reduce fossil fuel use and associated carbon emissions, or to drive the substitution of renewable forms of energy for oil and gas, may over time reduce demand for oil and gas and therefore the demand for our services; 
 new or expanded regulations that materially limit our customers access to federal and state lands for oil and gas development, thereby reducing demand for our services in the affected areas; 
 growing demand for electric vehicles that result in reduced demand for gasoline and therefore the demand for our services; 
 our ability to successfully implement technological developments and enhancements, including our new Tier IV Dynamic Gas Blending ("DGB") dual-fuel and FORCE electric-powered hydraulic fracturing equipment, and other lower-emissions equipment we may acquire or that may be sought by our customers; 
 the projected timing, purchase price and number of shares purchased under our share repurchase program, the sources of funds under the repurchase program and the impacts of the repurchase program; 
 operating hazards, natural disasters, weather-related delays, casualty losses and other matters beyond our control, such as fires, which risks may be self-insured, or may not be fully covered under our insurance programs; 
 exposure to cyber-security events which could cause operational disruptions or reputational harm; 
 acts of terrorism, war or political or civil unrest in the United States or elsewhere; and 
 the effects of current and future litigation. 
 Whether actual results and developments will conform with our expectations and predictions contained in forward-looking statements is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from such expectations and predictions, including, without limitation, in addition to those specified in the text surrounding such statements, the risks described under Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-Q and elsewhere throughout this report, the risks described under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "Form 10-K"), filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and elsewhere throughout that report, and other risks, many of which are beyond our control. 
 Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which are made as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We do not undertake, and expressly disclaim, any duty to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities laws. Investors are also advised to carefully review and consider the various risks and other disclosures discussed in our SEC reports, including the risk factors described in the Form 10-K.

 Deferred cash consideration Contingent consideration Total consideration 
 Cash consideration includes million paid to the seller, million paid to settle the seller s outstanding debt, and million paid for the seller s transaction expenses. 
 Included in the deferred cash consideration is a liability incurred to the seller of million. In the purchase agreement as a post-closing transaction, AquaProp's seller agreed to purchase and then sell to the Company, and the Company agreed to purchase from the seller, additional equipment spreads within days of the closing at a purchase price equal to cost plus a premium. The post-closing transaction was determined to be a transaction separate from the business combination, but the premium was determined to represent consideration transferred in the business combination as the above market terms of the arrangement would not have been agreed upon absent the business combination. Accordingly, the liability incurred to the seller was recognized as consideration in the business combination as cash was not paid at closing. The post-closing transaction for the Company s purchase of the additional equipment occurred in July 2024 and the purchases were accounted for as additions

 more additional equipment spreads at the request of the Company within a period following the delivery of the first additional spread at a purchase price equal to the lower of million or cost. The additional post-closing transaction was determined to be a transaction separate from the business combination, and no portion of the transaction was determined to represent consideration transferred in the business combination as the terms were at market. The additional post-closing transaction for the Company s purchase of the additional equipment will be accounted for as additions to property and equipment in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and capital expenditures in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
 The acquisition of AquaProp also included a contingent consideration arrangement that requires additional consideration to be paid by the Company to the seller based on the amount of wet sand delivered during a period following the delivery of the first additional spread, attributable to the additional equipment spreads described above. Amounts are payable under the earnout arrangement if the Company reaches certain delivery thresholds (in tons) of wet sand using the specific equipment provided by the seller or by other parties. The range of the undiscounted amounts the Company could be obligated to pay under the contingent consideration agreement is between and million. The fair value of the contingent consideration for the business combination recognized at the acquisition date of million was estimated by applying the probability-weighted expected return method for the different scenarios that may occur based on the amount of additional equipment delivered by the seller, at the request of the Company, and the amount of wet sand expected to be delivered by such equipment. The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration is based on significant inputs not observable in the market, and thus represent Level 3 measurements. The contingent consideration payable will be adjusted to estimated fair value at the end of each subsequent reporting period until the contingencies are resolved and consideration payments are made. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration payable was million at September 30, 2024, resulting in a million decrease from June 30, 2024. The decrease in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration payable was primarily driven by updated projections regarding the probability of different scenarios and the amount and timing of additional equipment to be delivered by the seller under those scenarios. The decrease in the estimated contingent consideration payable is included in other income (expense) in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Preliminary estimates of fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are based on information provided by AquaProp's seller and available through the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company is continuing to evaluate the underlying inputs and assumptions used in the valuations and the completeness of assets and liabilities recognized as the AquaProp Acquisition closed on May 31, 2024. Amounts recorded for all assets acquired, other than cash, and liabilities assumed, and the completeness of assets and liabilities recognized, are provisional. Accordingly, these preliminary estimates are subject to change during the measurement period. The measurement period ends on the earlier of the Company obtaining all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date or one year from the acquisition date. As we

 million. The gross amount due under contracts is million, of which none is expected to be uncollectible. The Company did not acquire any other class of receivable as a result of the acquisition of AquaProp. 
 The assets acquired include intangible assets, the trademark/trade name for AquaProp and the customer relationships. The trademark was assigned a fair value of million with residual value and will be amortized on a straight line basis over . The customer relationships were assigned a fair value of million with residual value and will be amortized on a straight line basis over . The fair value of the trademark was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which calculates the hypothetical royalty fees that would be saved by owning an intangible asset rather than licensing it from another owner. This method forecasts revenue over the estimated useful life of the asset and then applies the following: a royalty rate based on comparable royalty and/or licensing transactions, income tax rate and discount rate, to calculate the discounted cash flows to arrive at the value of the trademark. Key assumptions include revenue forecasted at historical trends with a long-term growth rate, royalty rate, income tax rate and a discount rate. The fair value of the customer relationships was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method. This method is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method, in which revenue derived from the intangible asset is estimated using total business revenue as a proxy and subsequently adjusted for attrition. Then deductions are made for business expenses and required returns attributable to other assets in the business. The excess earnings after these deductions are discounted to present value at an appropriate rate of return to arrive at the intangible asset value. Key assumptions include revenue forecasted at historical trends with a long-term growth rate, attrition rate, income tax rate and a discount rate. 
 The goodwill is attributable to the acquired workforce and significant synergies. Goodwill is assigned to the hydraulic fracturing operating segment of the Company. The goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made a measurement period adjustment to increase accounts payable acquired as part of the acquisition of AquaProp by million to reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the acquisition date. This adjustment decreased the deferred cash consideration payable to the seller. 
 The acquired business generated revenues of million and a net loss of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and revenues of million and a net loss of million for the period from May 31, 2024, to September 30, 2024.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made a measurement period adjustment to decrease accounts receivable by million. These measurement period adjustments reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the acquisition date. The cumulative impact of these adjustments was a decrease in deferred cash consideration payable.

 Note 4 - Fair Value Measurements (Continued) 

 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term debt are estimated to be approximately equivalent to carrying amounts as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and have been excluded from the table below. 
 ) Business acquisition contingent consideration payable December 31, 2023: Short-term investment ) 
 Short-term investment On September 1, 2022, the Company received million common shares of STEP Energy Services Ltd. ("STEP") with an estimated fair value of million as part of the consideration for the sale of our coiled tubing assets to STEP. The shares were treated as an investment in equity securities measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs based on observable prices on the Toronto Stock Exchange and are shown under current assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the short-term investment was estimated at million.

The contingent consideration payable was measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs based on the probability-weighted expected return method and is shown under other long-term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the contingent consideration payable is remeasured at the end of each reporting period. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration payable was million resulting in a million decrease from June 30, 2024. The decrease in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration payable was primarily driven by updated projections regarding the probability of different scenarios and the amount and timing of additional equipment to be delivered by the seller under those scenarios. Increases or decreases in any valuation inputs in isolation may result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement in the future.

 million which represented the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company's Tier II Units was recorded in our hydraulic fracturing reportable segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of our Tier II Units of million was determined using the market and cost approaches, which represent nonrecurring Level 3 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy. Our fair value estimates required us to use significant unobservable inputs, including assumptions related to replacement cost, among others. The carrying value of our Tier II Units prior to the impairment expense was approximately million. impairment of property and equipment was recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Additionally, since the Company plans to phase out its Tier II Units earlier than the current weighted average remaining useful life of this asset group, we shortened the remaining useful lives of those Tier II Units that currently have useful lives beyond 2027 to no longer than the end of 2027 to align with management's use and expected economic life. This change was made effective October 1, 2024. 
 additions to goodwill during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we added million of goodwill to our hydraulic fracturing operating segment related to the acquisition of AquaProp. There were additions to goodwill during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . At September 30, 2024, our hydraulic fracturing operating segment and our wireline operating segment (which are also considered reporting units) included goodwill amounting to million and million, respectively. The wireline operating segment was the only segment with goodwill at December 31, 2023. Our Tier II Units are only a portion of our hydraulic fracturing reporting unit and the impairment of these assets did not indicate an overall decrease in the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Accordingly, we determined that impairment to the carrying value of goodwill for either of our reporting units (hydraulic fracturing and wireline operating segments) was required as of September 30, 2024 . There were goodwill impairment losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, as of December 31, 2023 and determined that impairment to the carrying value of goodwill for our reporting unit (wireline operating segment) was required.

 Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, our operating segments met the aggregation criteria in accordance with ASC 280 Segment Reporting and were aggregated into the Completion Services reportable segment. Effective as of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we revised our segment reporting as we determined that our operating segments no longer met the criteria to be aggregated. Our Hydraulic Fracturing and Wireline operating segments meet the criteria of a reportable segment. Our cementing segment does not meet the reportable segment criteria and is included within the All Other category. Additionally, our corporate administrative activities do not involve business activities from which it may earn revenues and its results are not regularly reviewed by the Company s CODM when making key operating and resource decisions. As a result, corporate administrative expenses and inter-segment revenue have been included under Reconciling Items.

Since we have not taken possession of these assets and do not control them, we have not accounted for the associated right-of-use asset and lease obligation on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 We currently expect to receive majority of the remaining equipment associated with the fifth fleet in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In October 2022, we entered into a real estate lease contract for years (the " Real Estate Two Lease"), with a commencement date of March 1, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company made lease payments of approxim ately million and million, respectively . The assets and liabilities under this contract are included in our Completion Services reportable segment. In addition to the contractual lease period, the contract includes optional renewals of each, and in management's judgment the exercise of the renewal option is not reasonably assured. The contract does not include a residual value guarantee, covenants or financial restrictions. Further, the Real Estate Two Lease does not contain variability in payments resulting from either an index change or rate change. 
 We accounted for our Real Estate Two Lease as an operating lease. Our assumptions resulted from the existence of the right to control the use of the assets throughout the lease term. We did not account for the land separately from the building of the Real Estate Two Lease because we concluded that the accounting effect was insignificant. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average discount rate and remaining lease term was approximatel y and years , respectively. 
 As part of our acquisition of Silvertip Completion Services Operating, LLC , we assumed real estate lease contracts (the "Silvertip One Lease" and "Silvertip Two Lease," and collectively the "Silvertip Leases") with remaining terms of years and years, respectively, from November 1, 2022. During 2023, we extended the Silvertip One Lease for an additional years . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made lease payments of approxim ately million and million on t he Silvertip One Lease and S ilvertip Two Lease, respectively.

ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The financial information, discussion and analysis that follow should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Form 10-K as well as the financial and other information included therein. 
 Unless otherwise indicated, references in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" to the "Company," "we," "our," "us" or like terms refer to ProPetro Holding Corp. and its subsidiaries. 
 Overview 
 We are a leading integrated oilfield service company, located in Midland, Texas, focused on providing innovative hydraulic fracturing, wireline and other complementary oilfield completion services to leading upstream oil and gas companies engaged in the E P of North American oil and natural gas resources. Our operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin, where we have cultivated longstanding customer relationships with some of the region's most active and well-capitalized E P companies. The Permian Basin is widely regarded as one of the most prolific oil-producing areas in the United States, and we believe we are one of the leading providers of completion services in the region. 
 Our completion services include our operating segments comprised of hydraulic fracturing, wireline and cementing operations. Our hydraulic fracturing operations account for approximately 75.9 of our total revenues and operations as of September 30, 2024. Our total available hydraulic horsepower ("HHP") as of September 30, 2024, was 1,564,500 HHP, which was comprised of 450,000 HHP of our Tier IV DGB dual-fuel equipment, 252,000 HHP of FORCE electric-powered equipment and 862,500 HHP of conve ntional Tier II equipment. Our hydraulic fracturing fleets range from approximately 50,000 to 80,000 HHP depending on the job design and customer demand at the wellsite. Our equipment has been designed to handle the operating conditions commonly encountered in the Permian Basin and the region s increasingly high-intensity well completions (including simultaneous hydraulic fracturing ("Simul-Frac"), which involves fracturing multiple wellbores at the same time), which are characterized by longer horizontal wellbores, more stages per lateral and increasing amounts of proppant per well. With the industry transition to lower emissions equipment and Simul-Frac, in addition to several other changes to our customers' job designs, we believe that our available fleet capacity could decline if we decide to reconfigure our fleets to increase active HHP and backup HHP at wellsites. In addition, in 2021 and 2022, we committed to additional conversions of some of our Tier II equipment to Tier IV DGB, and to purchase new Ti er IV DGB dual-fuel equipment. As such, we entered into conversion and purchase agreements with our equipment manufacturers for a total of 450,000 HH P of Tier IV DGB dual-fuel equipment and we have received all of the converted and new Tier IV DGB dual-fuel equipment by the end of 2023. In 2022, we entered into three-year electric fleet leases for four FORCE electric-powered hydraulic fracturing fleets with 60,000 H HP per flee t (the "Electric Fleet Leases") and in June 2024, we entered into an additional three-year lease for a fifth FORCE electric-powered hydraulic fracturing fleet with 72,000 HHP. As of September 30, 2024, we have received 252,000 HHP of FORCE electric-powered equipment representing four fleets and a portion of the fifth fleet. We currently expect to receive majority of the remaining equipment associated with the fifth fleet in the fourth quarter of 2024. We current ly have 26 wireline units and 38 cem ent units. 
 On December 1, 2023, we consummated the purchase of the assets and operations of Par Five Energy Services LLC Par Five ), which provides cementing services in the Delaware Basin, in exchange for 25.4 million of cash, including deferred cash consideration of 3.1 million which is payable to Par Five or its beneficiary on June 1, 2025 with interest at 4.0 per annum . Par Five s business complements our existing cementing business and enables us to serve both the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin. 
 On May 31, 2024, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests in Aqua Prop, LLC AquaProp ), an oilfield service company based in Midland, Texas that provides wet sand solutions for hydraulic fracturing sand requirements at oil well sites in exchange for 13.7 million of cash, 3.7 million of deferred cash consideration payable to AquaProp's seller by May 31, 2025, the payoff of 7.2 million of assumed debt, the payment of 0.3 million of certain transaction costs and estimated contingent consideration of 10.9 million. As a result of the acquisition, we expanded our operations into the wet sand service business unit. 
 Our competitors include many large and small oilfield service companies, including Halliburton Company, Liberty Energy Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., ProFrac Holding Corp., RPC, Inc., and a number of private and locally-oriented businesses. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, an oilfield services company must provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas E P companies at competitive prices. Competitive factors impacting sales of our services are price, reputation, technical expertise, emissions profile, service and equipment design and quality, and health and safety standards. Although we believe our customers consider all of these factors, we believe price is a key factor in an E P company's criteria in choosing a service provider. However, we have recently observed the energy industry and our customers shift to lower emissions equipment, which we believe will be an increasingly important factor in an E P company's selection of a service provider. The transition to lower emissions equipment has been challenging for companies in the oilfield service 
 -30- 

industry because of the capital requirements, lack of large scale deployment of certain new technology such as electric-powered equipment, pricing for services and expected return on invested capital. While we seek to price our services competitively, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on our operational efficiencies, productivity, equipment portfolio and quality, reliability, ability to manage multifaceted logistics challenges, commitment to safety and the ability of our people to handle the most complex Permian Basin well completions. 
 Our substantial market presence in the Permian Basin positions us well to capitalize on drilling and completion activity in the region. Primarily, our operational focus has been in the Permian Basin's Midland sub-basin, where our customers have operated. However, we have increased our operations in the Delaware sub-basin and are well-positioned to support further increases to our activity in this area in response to demand from our customers. Over time, we expect the Permian Basin's Midland and Delaware sub-basins to continue to command a disproportionate share of future North American E P spending. 
 We have historically conducted our business through three operating segments: hydraulic fracturing, wireline and cementing. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, our operating segments met the aggregation criteria and were aggregated into the Completion Services reportable segment. Effective as of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we revised our segment reporting as we determined that our three operating segments no longer met the criteria to be aggregated. Our Hydraulic Fracturing and Wireline operating segments meet the criteria of a reportable segment. Our cementing segment is not material, is not separately reportable, and is included within the All Other category. Prior period segment information has been revised to conform to our current presentation. For additional financial information on our reportable segments presentation, please see "Note 7 - Reportable Segment Information." 
 Pioneer Pressure Pumping Acquisition 
 On December 31, 2018, we consummated the purchase of certain pressure pumping assets and real property from Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc. ("Pioneer") and Pioneer Pumping Services (the "Pioneer Pressure Pumping Acquisition") in exchange for 16.6 million shares of our common stock and 110.0 million in cash. In May 2024, Pioneer merged with and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation ("ExxonMobil") after which ExxonMobil became the owner of these shares. The Company currently provides pressure pumping, wireline and other services to ExxonMobil and previously provided such services to Pioneer. 
 On April 22, 2024, we entered into a Subagreement for Hydraulic Fracturing Services with XTO Energy Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ExxonMobil, where we will provide hydraulic fracturing, wireline and pumpdown services with two committed FORCE electric-powered hydraulic fracturing fleets with the option to add a third FORCE fleet (also with wireline and pumpdown services) for a period of three years or for contracted hours, whichever occurs last with respect to each fleet, subject to certain termination and release rights. 
 Commodity Price and Other Economic Conditions 
 The oil and gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is characterized by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including domestic and international supply and demand for oil and gas, current and expected future prices for oil and gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, and capital investments of E P companies toward their development and production of oil and gas reserves. The oil and gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions such as supply chain disruptions and inflation, war and political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and internationally), levels of consumer demand, adverse weather conditions, the United States presidential election, and other factors that are beyond our control. 
 Since October 2023, an ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Israel-Gaza region has led to significant armed hostilities, including elsewhere in the Middle East. On April 13, 2024, Iran launched an attack on several targets in Israel, and in response the U.S. and a number of its allies have stated an intent to impose additional sanctions on Iran. The geopolitical and macroeconomic consequences of this conflict remain uncertain, and such events, or any further hostilities in the Israel-Gaza region, with Iran or elsewhere, could severely impact the world economy, the demand for and price of crude oil and the oil and gas industry generally and may adversely affect our financial condition. 
 Similarly, the geopolitical and macroeconomic consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the associated sanctions, and the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in recent years have resulted in volatility in supply and demand dynamics for crude o il and associated volatility in crude oil pricing. As the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic began to wane, the demand and prices for crude oil increased from the lows experienced in 2020, with the West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") average crude oil price reaching approximately 94 per barrel in 2022, the highest average price in the prior nine years. The WTI average crude oil price declined to approximately 78 per barrel in 2023 and approximately 75 per barrel in the third quarter of 2024. We believe that the volatility of crude oil prices in recent years has been partly driven by declines in crude oil supplies, concerns over sanctions resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, concerns over a potential disruption of 
 -31- 

Middle Eastern oil supplies resulting from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Israel-Gaza region, slower crude oil production growth due to the lack of reinvestment in the oil and gas industry in the last two years, the extension of OPEC+ production cuts of approximately 3.85 million barrel s per day originally announced in 2023, and concerns of a potential global recession resulting from high inflation and interest rates. 
 With the significant increase in global crude oil prices from 2021, including the WTI crude oil price, there has been an increase in the Permian Basin rig count from approximately 179 at the beginning of 2021 to approximately 353 at the end of 2022, according to the Baker Hughes Company. Following the increase in rig count and the WTI crude oil price, the oilfield service industry has experienced increased demand for its completion services, and improved pricing. However, we have recently experienced a 13 dec rease in the rig count in 2023 to 309 at the end of 2023 and a further decrease to 304 at the end of September 2024 which resulted in a reduction in the demand for completion services and pressure on pricing of our services. 
 Sustained levels of high inflation have likewise caused the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to increase interest rates, and to the extent elevated inflation remains, we may experience further cost increases for our operations, including interest rates, labor costs and equipment. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation and crude oil prices. A significant increase in or continued high levels of inflation, to the extent we are unable to timely pass-through the cost increases to our customers, or further declines in crude oil prices would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Government regulations and investors are demanding the oil and gas industry transition to a lower emissions operating environment, including upstream and oilfield service companies. As a result, we are working with our customers and equipment manufacturers to transition our equipment to a lower emissions profile. Currently, a number of lower emission solutions for pumping equipment, including Tier IV DGB dual-fuel, FORCE electric, direct drive gas turbine and other technologies have been developed, and we expect additional lower emission solutions will be developed in the future. We are continually evaluating these technologies and other investment and acquisition opportunities that would support our existing and new customer relationships. The transition to lower emissions equipment is quickly evolving and will be capital intensive. Over time, we plan to replace our conventional Tier II diesel-only equipment with lower emissions equipment. We have transitioned our hydraulic fracturing equipment portfolio from approximately 10 lower emissions equipment in 2021 to approximately 35 in 2022 and approximately 60 in 2023, and expect to increase to approximately 75 by the end of 2024. To the extent any of our customers have certain expectations or requirements with respect to emissions reductions from their contractors, if we are unable to continue to quickly transition to lower emissions equipment, the demand for our services could be adversely impacted. 
 If the Permian Basin rig count and market conditions improve, including improved pricing for our services and labor availability, and we are able to meet our customers' lower emissions equipment demands, we believe our operational and financial results will also improve. If the rig count or market conditions do not improve or decline in the future, and we are unable to increase our pricing or pass-through future cost increases to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Our results of operations have historically reflected seasonal tendencies, typically in the fourth quarter, relating to the holiday season, inclement winter weather and exhaustion of our customers' annual budgets. As a result, we typically experience declines in our operating and financial results in November and December, even in a stable commodity price and operations environment. 
 How We Evaluate Our Operations 
 Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA margin to evaluate and analyze the performance of our various operating segments. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 We view Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as important indicators of performance. We define EBITDA as our earnings, before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus (i) loss/(gain) on disposal of assets, (ii) stock-based compensation, (iii) other expense/(income), (iv) other unusual or nonrecurring (income)/expenses such as costs related to asset acquisitions, insurance recoveries, one-time professional fees and legal settlements and (v) retention bonuses and severance. Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of our revenues. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are supplemental measures utilized by our management and other users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, and research analysts, to assess our financial performance because it allows us and other users to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the 
 -32- 

effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), nonrecurring (income)/expenses and items outside the control of our management team (such as income taxes). Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss), operating income/(loss), cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). 
 Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP ("non-GAAP"), except when specifically required to be disclosed by GAAP in the financial statements. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure, asset base, nonrecurring expenses (income) and items outside the control of the Company. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA margin in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.

Results of Operations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we conducted our business through three operating segments: hydraulic fracturing, wireline and cementing. Our cementing operating segment is shown in the "All Other" category for segment reporting purposes. 
 On December 1, 2023, we consummated the purchase of the assets and operations of Par Five, which provides cementing services in the Delaware Basin in exchange for cash consideration of 25.3 million. Par Five s business complements our existing cementing business and enables us to serve both the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin. On May 31, 2024, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests in AquaProp in exchange for 13.7 million of cash, 3.7 million of deferred cash consideration payable to AquaProp's seller by May 31, 2025, the payoff of 7.2 million of assumed debt, the payment of 0.3 million of certain transaction costs and estimated contingent consideration of 10.9 million. As a result of the acquisition, we expanded our operations into the wet sand service business unit. The Company's 2024 results include the impact of Par Five's and AquaProp's operations neither of which were included in our 2023 results herein because we acquired Par Five in December 2023 and AquaProp in May 2024. Accordingly, the full impact of the results of Par Five and AquaProp may affect the comparability of our 2024 results when compared to prior period. Par Five's operations, which are included for the entire period, resulted in 9.6 million and 29.4 million in revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 6.4 million and 22.9 million in cost of services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which are included in the All Other category. AquaProp's operations, which are included from the date of acquisition in May 2024 through the end of the quarter, resulted in 18.7 million and 23.6 million in revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 19.4 million and 23.0 million in cost of services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which are included in the Hydraulic Fracturing reportable segment.

 Hydraulic Fracturing. Our hydraulic fracturing segment revenues decreased 19.4 , or 66.0 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased customer pricing, partially offset by increased efficiency and the addition of AquaProp's operations in May 2024, which contributed 18.7 million in revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our hydraulic fracturing fleet count remained stable at approximately 14 active fleets during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Wireline. Our wireline segment revenues decreased 9.1 or 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased customer pricing. 
 All Other. Revenues from the All Other category comprised of our cementing operations increased 25.8 or 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of Par Five's operations in December 2023, which contributed to 9.6 million of the net increase in revenues. 
 Cost of Services. Cost of services decreased 8.5 , or 24.9 million, to 267.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 292.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of services by reportable segment was as follows: 
 Hydraulic Fracturing. Cost of services in our hydraulic fracturing segment decreased 30.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of hydraulic fracturing segment revenues (including equipment reservation fees), hydraulic fracturing cost of services was 73.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 68.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by customer price decreases and the impact of general cost inflation. The decrease in cost of services was partially offset by the addition of AquaProp's operations in May 2024, which added 19.4 million in cost of services during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Wireline. Our wireline segment cost of services increased 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in repairs and maintenance expense and the impact of general cost inflation. 
 All Other. Cost of service for the All Other category increased 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of Par Five's operations in December 2023, which resulted in 6.4 million of the net increase in cost of services. 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 0.8 , or 0.2 million, to 28.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 28.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a 2.2 million decrease in insurance expense resulting from workers' compensation, general liability and automobile insurance costs being allocated more to cost of services in 2024 compared to 2023 since these costs are primarily incurred for our operational workforce and (ii) a 0.7 million decrease in professional fees, partially offset by (i) a 1.3 million increase in stock-based compensation, (ii) a 1.1 million increase in payroll and related expenses and (iii) a 0.3 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. 
 Excluding nonrecurring and non-cash items (i.e., stock-based compensation of 4.6 million, retention bonuses and severance expenses of 1.2 million and nonrecurring transaction expenses of 0.4 million), general and administrative expenses were 22.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 23.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased 19.7 , or 8.9 million, to 54.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 45.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) assets placed into service since September 30, 2023, (ii) the addition of a finance lease for certain power generation equipment in August 2023 which resulted in 4.8 million of amortization, (iii) the addition of Par 
 -38- 

Five's operations in December 2023 which included 1.0 million of depreciation and (iv) the addition of AquaProp's operations in May 2024 which included 1.4 million of depreciation and amortization. 
 Impairment Expense. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a noncash impairment expense of 188.6 million in connection with the impairment of our Tier II Units. There was no impairment expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loss on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets decreased 83.0 , or 10.5 million, to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to losses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 from the decommissioning of certain hydraulic fracturing equipment and replacement of certain major components in connection with our conversion of certain Tier II hydraulic fracturing equipment to Tier IV DGB. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest rates on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in April 2022, as amended in June 2023, as amended in June 2024, and as may be amended further, "ABL Credit Facility") during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the addition of a finance lease for certain power generation equipment in August 2023. 
 Other Income. Other income was approximately 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other income of 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily comprised of tax refunds of 1.8 million and a 1.8 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration payable on our acquisition of AquaProp. Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily comprised of a 1.8 million unrealized gain on short-term investment. 
 Income Taxes. Total income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 w as 41.4 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.2 that differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the application of the interim period reporting rules to our results of operations.

 Income Taxes. Total income tax benefit w as 28.0 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 18.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a s compared to income tax expense of 31.1 million or an effective tax rate of 23.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily attributable to the difference in the impact of nondeductible expenses and state taxes on the pre-tax loss for 2024, as compared to pre-tax income for 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity is currently provided by (i) existing cash balances, (ii) operating cash flows and (iii) borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. Our cash is primarily used to fund our operations, support growth opportunities, fund share repurchases under our share repurchase program and satisfy future debt payments. Our borrowing base, as redetermined monthly, is tied to the sum of 85 to 90 of monthly eligible accounts receivable and 80 of eligible unbilled accounts (up to a maximum of 25 of the borrowing base), in each case, depending on the credit ratings of our accounts receivable counterparties, less customary reserves (the "Borrowing Base"). Changes to our operational activity levels and our customers' credit ratings have an impact on our total eligible accounts receivable, which could result in significant changes to our Borrowing Base and therefore, our availability under our ABL Credit Facility. 
 We received advance payments from a customer for our services, and the amount outstanding in connection with the advance payments as of September 30, 2024 was 13.9 million, which does not include any restricted cash. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility were 45.0 million and our total liquidity was approximately 127.0 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 46.6 million and 80.4 million of availability under our ABL Credit Facility. 
 On April 24, 2024, the Company's board of directors (the "Board") approved an increase and extension to the share repurchase program previously authorized on May 17, 2023. The program permits the repurchase of up to an additional 100 million of the Company's common stock for a total of 200 million and extends the expiration date by one year to May 31, 2025. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, block trades, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, derivative transactions or otherwise, certain of which may be made pursuant to a trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, as amended, in compliance with applicable state and federal 
 -42- 

securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including management's assessment of the intrinsic value of the Company's common stock, the market price of the Company's common stock, general market and economic conditions, available liquidity, compliance with the Company's debt and other agreements, applicable legal requirements, and other considerations. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the repurchase program, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company expects to fund the repurchases using cash on hand and expected free cash flow to be generated through May 2025. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and retired 1.3 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of 10.2 million, an average price per share of 8.06 including commissions, under the repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, 92.5 million remained authorized for future repurchases of common stock under the repurchase program. 
 There can be no assurance that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures and to continue with our share repurchases under our share repurchase program or fund future business acquisitions. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, and are highly dependent on the drilling, completion, and production activity by our customers, which in turn is highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices. Depending upon market conditions and other factors, we may issue equity and debt securities or take other actions necessary to fund our business, strategy or meet our future long-term liquidity requirements. 
 Capital Requirements, Future Sources and Use of Cash and Contractual Obligations 
 Capital expenditures incurred were 36.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 59.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 for our reportable segments. The significant portion of our total capital expenditures incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were maintenance capital expenditures. 
 Our future material use of cash will be to fund our capital expenditures. We may also use material amounts of cash to repurchase shares under our share repurchase program. Capital expenditures for 2024 are projected to be primarily related to capital expenditures to extend the useful life of our existing completion services assets, costs to convert some existing equipment to lower emissions equipment, strategic purchases and other ancillary equipment purchases, subject to market conditions and customer demand and potential strategic acquisitions. Our future capital expenditures depend on our projected operational activity, emission requirements and planned conversions to lower emissions equipment, among other factors, which could vary significantly throughout the year. Based on our current plan and projected activity levels for 2024, we expect our capital expenditures to range between 150 million and 175 million. We could incur significant additional capital expenditures if our projected activity levels increase during the course of the year, inflation and supply chain tightness continue to adversely impact our operations or we invest in new or different lower emissions equipment. The Company will continue to evaluate the emissions profile of its equipment over the coming years and may, depending on market conditions, convert or retire additional conventional Tier II equipment in favor of lower emissions equipment. The Company s decisions regarding the retirement or conversion of equipment or the addition of lower emissions equipment will be subject to a number of factors, including (among other factors) the availability of equipment, including parts and major components, supply chain disruptions, prevailing and expected commodity prices, customer demand and requirements and the Company s evaluation of projected returns on conversion or other capital expenditures. Depending on the impacts of these factors, the Company may decide to retain conventional equipment for a longer period of time or accelerate the retirement, replacement or conversion of that equipment. 
 We anticipate our capital expenditures will be funded by existing cash, cash flows from operations, and if needed, borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. Our cash flows from operations will be generated from services we provide to our customers. 
 We entered into a sand purchase agreement with a supplier that will expire on December 31, 2024 with a remaining take-or-pay commitment of ap proximately 2.3 million. We also entered into the Electric Fleet Leases, which contain options to extend the leases or purchase the equipment at the end of each lease or at the end of each subsequent renewal period. As of September 30, 2024, all five of the Electric Fleet Leases commenced when the Company took possession of all equipment associated with its first four FORCE electric-powered hydraulic fracturing fleets and some of the equipment associated with its fifth fleet under these leases. Lease payments pertaining to the remaining equipment associated with the fifth Electric Fleet Lease are expected to commence when the Company takes possession of the remaining associated equipment. We currently expect to receive majority of the remaining equipment associated with the fifth fleet in the fourth quarter of 2024. The total estimated contractual commitment in connection with the Electric Fleet Leases excluding the cost associated with the option to purchase the equipment at the end of each lease is approximately 130.9 million. We also entered into a three year lease (the "Power Equipment Lease") for certain power generation equipment. The total estimated contractual commitment in connection with the Power Equipment Lease is approximately 39.6 million. 
 -43- 

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations and incur expenses in connection with routine growth, conversion and maintenance capital expenditures that impact our future liquidity. There were no other known future material contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 . 
 Cash, Restricted Cash and Cash Flows 
 The following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 214,432 305,071 Net cash used in investing activities (130,603) (312,771) Net cash used in financing activities (70,617) (26,832) 
 Cash Flows From Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 214.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 305.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net decrease of approximately 90.6 million was primarily due to lower net income adjusted for noncash expenses and the timing of our receivable collections from our customers and payments to our vendors. 
 Cash Flows From Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased to 130.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 312.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to our capital light strategy and the completion of our planned investments in Tier IV DGB equipment, partially offset by the acquisition of AquaProp. 
 Cash Flows From Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased to 70.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 26.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase was primarily driven by net borrowings of 15.0 million under our ABL Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a 12.2 million increase in payments of finance lease obligation and a 19.5 million increase in share repurchases, partially offset by a 2.1 million decrease in tax withholdings paid for net settlement of equity awards and payment of debt issuance costs of 1.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Credit Facility and Other Financing Arrangements 
 Our revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in April 2022, prior to giving effect to the amendment to the revolving credit facility in June 2023, had a total borrowing capacity of 150.0 million. The revolving credit facility had a borrowing base of 85 to 90 , depending on the credit ratings of our accounts receivable counterparties, of monthly eligible accounts receivable less customary reserves. The revolving credit facility included a springing fixed charge coverage ratio to apply when excess availability was less than the greater of (i) 10 of the lesser of the facility size or the borrowing base or (ii) 10.0 million. Under the revolving credit facility we were required to comply, subject to certain exceptions and materiality qualifiers, with certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants pertaining to our ability to incur liens, indebtedness, changes in the nature of our business, mergers and other fundamental changes, disposal of assets, investments and restricted payments, amendments to our organizational documents or accounting policies, prepayments of certain debt, dividends, transactions with affiliates, and certain other activities. 
 Effective June 2, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the ABL Credit Facility. The amendment increased the borrowing capacity under the ABL Credit Facility to 225.0 million (subject to the Borrowing Base limit), and extended the maturity date to June 2, 2028. 
 Effective June 26, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the ABL Credit Facility. The amendment increased the amount of non-cash consideration that may be considered cash pursuant to certain permitted dispositions. 
 The Borrowing Base as of September 30, 2024, was approximate ly 131.4 million. T he ABL Credit Facility includes a springing fixed charge coverage ratio to apply when excess availability is less than the greater of (i) 10 of the lesser of the 
 -44- 

facility size or the Borrowing Base or (ii) 15.0 million. Under the ABL Credit Facility we are required to comply, subject to certain exceptions and materiality qualifiers, with certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants pertaining to our ability to incur liens, indebtedness, changes in the nature of our business, mergers and other fundamental changes, disposal of assets, investments and restricted payments, amendments to our organizational documents or accounting policies, prepayments of certain debt, dividends, transactions with affiliates, and certain other activities. Borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien and security interest in substantially all assets of the Company. 
 Borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility accrue interest based on a three-tier pricing grid tied to availability, and we may elect for loans to be based on either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or the base rate, plus the applicable margin, which ranges from 1.75 to 2.25 for SOFR loans and 0.75 to 1.25 for base rate loans. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024.
