 Forward-looking statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us. Such beliefs and assumptions may or may not prove to be correct. Additionally, such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q due to various factors, including, but not limited to, those identified in Part I.

Our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and maintain or grow the number of Unlimited Wash Club UWC Members. 

If we are unable to compete successfully against other companies and operators in our industry, including our ability to acquire, open and operate new locations in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may lose customers and market share and our revenues may decline. 

We may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategies on a timely basis or at all.

In general, the effective tax rates differed from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes, non-deductible expenses such as those related to certain executive compensation, and other discrete tax adjustments recorded during the period.

On August 9, 2022, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors CHIPS Act of 2022 was signed into law. The CHIPS Act is designed to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and encourage U.S. research activities. Also in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act IRA of 2022 was signed into law. The IRA created a new book-minimum tax on certain large corporations and an excise tax on stock buybacks while also providing incentives to address climate change mitigation and clean energy, among other items. Most of these changes became effective for the 2023 tax year and after initial evaluation, and similar to the prior quarter, we do not currently expect these laws to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded and related to unrecognized tax benefits or interest and penalties related to any uncertain tax positions.

Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement On August 21, 2014, we entered into a Credit Agreement Credit Agreement which was originally comprised of a term loan First Lien Term Loan and a revolving commitment Revolving Commitment ). The Credit Agreement was collateralized by substantially all personal property (including cash, inventory, property and equipment, and intangible assets), real property, and equity interests owned by us. First Lien Term Loan In March 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 5 to the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A. ("BofA") as the successor administrative agent and collateral agent. This amendment further modified the credit agreement by providing in first lien term commitments, consisting of to refinance outstanding term loans and in additional incremental term commitments (collectively, the "2024 Term Loans"). T he 2024 Term Loans have an interest rate of Term SOFR or Base Rate, at our option, plus an applicable margin for SOFR Loans or for Base Rate Loans), subject to step-downs based on the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio. For SOFR Loans, the margin starts at 3.00 and can decrease to and based on the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio. For Base Rate Loans, the margin begins at 2.00 and can decrease to and , depending on the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio. . Starting September 30, 2024, the loans will be amortized in equal quarterly installments at an annual rate of 1.00 of the original principal amount. As a result of this amendment, the loans are scheduled to mature in March 2031 . In connection with Amendment No. 5, we expensed of previously unamortized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations. Revolving Commitment In March 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 5 to our Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement to increase our borrowing capacity from to .

Any unused commitment fee is also payable based on the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio. , tested quarterly beginning with the quarter ending September 30, 2024, for the benefit of lenders holding the Revolving Commitments. The Amendment also extends t he time in which we can draw revolving loans under the Revolving Commitments until the earliest of March 2029, permanent reduction of commitments to zero or termination of the commitment. The maximum available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Commitments is reduced by outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Commitments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Commitments was and , respectively. In addition, an unused commitment fee based on our First Lien Net Leverage Ratio is payable on the average of the unused borrowing capacity under the Revolving Commitments.

Deferred compensation plan 

Contingent consideration 

We measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities using the highest level of inputs that are available as of the measurement date. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. We maintain a deferred compensation plan for a certain group of our highly compensated employees, in which certain of our executive officers participate in. . Changes in the value of compensation deferred under these plans are recognized each period based on the fair value of the underlying measurement funds. These investment funds consist primarily of equity securities, such as common stock and mutual funds, and fixed income securities and are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and are classified as Level 1. These investment options do not represent actual ownership of or ownership rights in the applicable funds; they serve the purpose of valuing the account and the corresponding obligation of the Company. As of September 30, 2 24 and December 31, 2 23 , the fair value of our First Lien Term Loan approximated its carrying value due to the debt s variable interest rate terms . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held assets in cash investments. We recognized a Level 3 contingent consideration liability in connection with the Downtowner Car Wash acquisition in December 2021. We measured its contingent consideration liability using Level 3 unobservable inputs. The contingent consideration liability is associated with the achievement of certain targets and is estimated at each balance sheet date by considering among other factors, results of completed periods and our most recent financial projection for future periods subject to earn-out payments. There are two components to the contingent consideration: a payment when we obtained the certificate of occupancy for the car wash and opened it to the public in 2023 and an annual payment based on certain financial metrics of the acquired business. A change in the forecasted revenue or projected opening dates could result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measuremen t. We determined that there were significant changes to the unobservable inputs that would have resulted in a change in fair value of this contingent consideration liability at September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, a payment was made upon receipt of certificate of occupancy of and , respectively . payments were made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2 24 and 2 23 , there were transfers between fair value measurement levels.

Item 2 . Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2023 Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and in Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Who We Are 
 Mister Car Wash, Inc. is the largest national car wash brand, primarily offering express exterior cleaning services, with interior cleaning services at select locations, across 501 car washes in 21 states as of September 30, 2024. Founded in 1996, we employ an efficient, repeatable, and scalable process, which we call the Mister Experience, to deliver a clean, dry, and shiny car every time. The core pillars of the Mister Experience are greeting every customer with a wave and smile, providing the highest quality car wash, and delivering the experience quickly and conveniently. We offer a monthly subscription program, which we call the Unlimited Wash Club UWC ), as a flexible, quick, and convenient option for customers to keep their cars clean. Our scale and over 25 years of innovation allow us to drive operating efficiencies and invest in training, infrastructure, and technology that improve speed of service, quality, and sustainability and realize strong financial performance. 
 Factors Affecting Our Business and Trends 
 We believe that our business and growth depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us and may involve risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Growth in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales have been a driver of our net revenue growth and we expect it to continue to play a key role in our future growth and profitability. We will seek to continue to grow our comparable store sales by increasing the number of UWC Members, maximizing efficiency and throughput of our car wash locations, optimizing marketing spend to add new customers, and increasing customer visitation frequency. 

Number and loyalty of UWC Members . The UWC program is a critical element of our business. UWC Members contribute a significant portion of our net revenue and provide recurring revenue through their monthly membership fees. 

Labor management. Hiring and retaining skilled team members and experienced management represents one of our largest costs. We believe people are the key to our success and we have been able to successfully attract and retain engaged, high-quality team members by paying competitive wages, offering attractive benefit packages, and providing robust training and development opportunities. While the competition for skilled labor is intense and subject to high turnover, we believe our approach to wages and benefits will continue to allow us to attract suitable team members and management to support our growth. 

Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations 
 Our results have been affected by, and may in the future be affected by, the following factors, which must be understood in order to assess the comparability of our period-to-period financial performance and condition. 
 Greenfield Location Development 
 More recently, a component of our growth strategy has been to grow through greenfield development of Mister Car Wash locations, with particular focus on Express Exterior Locations, and we anticipate further pursuit of this strategy in the future. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we successfully opened 10 and 25 greenfield locations, respectively, and we expect to drive our future location growth through greenfield development. We believe such a strategy will provide a more controllable pipeline of unit growth for future locations in existing and adjacent markets. 
 The comparability of our results may be impacted by the inclusion of financial performance of greenfield locations that have not delivered a full fiscal year of financial results nor matured to average unit volumes, which we typically expect after approximately three full years of operation. 
 20 

Acquisitions 
 We continue to employ a disciplined approach to acquisitions, carefully selecting locations that meet our criteria for a potential Mister Car Wash site. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not consummate any acquisitions. 
 Following an acquisition, we implement a variety of operational improvements designed to unify branding and enhance profitability. As soon as feasible, we fully integrate and transition acquired locations to the Mister brand and make investments to improve site flow, upgrade tunnel equipment and technology, and install our proprietary Unity Chemical system, which is a unique blend of our signature products utilizing the newest technology and services to make a better car wash experience for our customers. We also establish member-only lanes, optimize service offerings and implement training initiatives that we have successfully utilized to improve team member engagement and drive UWC growth post-acquisition. The costs associated with these onboarding initiatives, which vary by site, can impact the comparability of our results. 
 The comparability of our results may also be impacted by the inclusion of financial performance of our acquisitions that have not delivered a full fiscal year of financial results under Mister Car Wash s ownership. 
 See Note 13 Business Combinations to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion. 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 We prepare and analyze various operating and financial data to assess the performance of our business and to help in the allocation of our resources. The key operating performance and financial metrics and indicators we use are set forth below, as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Location Count (end of period) 
 Our location count refers to the total number of car wash locations at the end of a period, inclusive of new greenfield locations, acquired locations and offset by closed locations. The total number of locations that we operate, as well as the timing of location openings, acquisitions, and closings, have, and will continue to have, an impact on our performance. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we increased our location count by the 10 and 25 greenfield locations, respectively, as noted above. 
 Our Express Exterior Locations, which offer express exterior cleaning services, comprise 436 of our current locations and our Interior Cleaning Locations, which offer both express exterior cleaning services and interior cleaning services, comprise 65 of our current locations. 
 Comparable Store Sales Growth 
 We consider a location a comparable store on the first day of the 13th full calendar month following a greenfield location s first day of operations, or for acquired locations, the first day of the 13th full calendar month following the date of acquisition. A location converted from an Interior Cleaning Location format to an Express Exterior Location format is excluded when the location did not offer interior cleaning services in the current period but did offer interior cleaning services in the prior year period. Comparable store sales growth is the percentage change in total wash sales of all comparable store car washes. 
 Increasing the number of new locations is a component of our growth strategy and as we continue to execute on our growth strategy, we expect that a significant portion of our sales growth will be attributable to non-comparable store sales. Accordingly, comparable store sales are only one measure we use to assess the success of our growth strategy. 
 21 

UWC Members (end of period) 
 Members of our monthly subscription service are known as Unlimited Wash Club Members, or UWC Members. We view the number of UWC Members and the growth in the number of UWC Members on a net basis from period to period as key indicators of our revenue growth. The number of UWC Members has grown over time as we have acquired new customers and retained previously acquired customers. There were approximately 2.1 million UWC Members as of September 30, 2024. UWC Members grew by approximately 2 from September 30, 2023 through September 30, 2024 and approximately 2 from December 31, 2023 through September 30, 2024. 
 UWC Sales as a Percentage of Total Wash Sales 
 UWC sales as a percentage of total wash sales represents the penetration of our subscription membership program as a percentage of our overall wash sales. Total wash sales are defined as the net revenue generated from express exterior cleaning services and interior cleaning services for both UWC Members and retail customers. UWC sales as a percentage of total wash sales is calculated as sales generated from UWC Members as a percentage of total wash sales. We have consistently grown this measure over time as we educate customers as to the value of our UWC subscription offering. UWC sales were 74 and 71 of our total wash sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. UWC sales were 73 and 70 of our total wash sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of our operating performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, net, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization expense, (gain) loss on sale of assets, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition expenses, non-cash rent expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, and other nonrecurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues for a given period. 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in future periods, and any such modification may be material. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries. 
 Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance compared to other measures, which can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. We also use Adjusted EBITDA in connection with establishing discretionary annual incentive compensation; to supplement U.S. GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies; to make budgeting decisions; and because our Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement uses measures similar to Adjusted EBITDA to measure our compliance with certain covenants. 
 Adjusted EBITDA has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations include: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditure or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in our cash requirements for our working capital needs; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense and the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for replacement of assets that are being depreciated and amortized; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect non-cash compensation, which is a key element of our overall long-term compensation; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges or cash receipts resulting from matters we do not find indicative of our ongoing operations; and 

other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. 

The following is a reconciliation of our net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.

The Adjusted EBITDA results in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year period are primarily attributable to growth in UWC Members, price optimization, wash package mix, and the year-over-year addition of 39 locations.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Funding Requirements 
 Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are to fund our investments in our core business, which includes lease payments, pursue greenfield location development, and acquisitions of new locations and to service our indebtedness. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through funds raised by the sale of our common stock, utilization of our Revolving Commitment, First Lien Term Loan, sale-leaseback transactions, and cash provided by operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 16.5 million and 19.0 million, respectively, and 277.8 million and 149.2 million , respectivel y, of available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Commitment. 
 For a description of our credit facilities and our recent debt refinancing, please see Note 8 Debt in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement. 
 We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our growth strategy and operations, as well as planned capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that cash provided by operating activities or cash 
 27 

and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all. 
 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 198.8 million and was comprised of net income of 61.1 million, increased by 144.5 million as a result of non-cash adjustments including depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash lease expense, deferred income taxes, a gain on disposal of property and equipment, a loss on extinguishment of debt, and amortization of debt issuance costs. Changes in working capital balances decreased cash provided by operating activities by 6.8 million and were primarily driven by operating lease payments and increases in other receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by decreases to accounts receivable, net, inventory and other noncurrent assets and liabilities and increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 165.5 million and was comprised of net income of 67.8 million, increased by 114.9 million as a result of non-cash adjustments comprised primarily of depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash lease expense, deferred income taxes, a gain on disposal of property and equipment, and amortization of debt issuance costs. Changes in working capital balances decreased cash provided by operating activities by 17.2 million and were primarily driven by operating lease payments, an increase in accounts receivable, net, offset by increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 223.5 million and was primarily comprised of investments in property and equipment to support our greenfield development and other initiatives, offset by the sale of property and equipment. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 173.7 million and was primarily comprised of investment in property and equipment to support our greenfield development and other initiatives and two acquisitions, offset by the sale of property and equipment. 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 22.1 million and was primarily comprised of proceeds from our refinancing of the First Lien Term Loan and Revolving Commitment, partially offset by payments for payroll tax withholdings to settle cashless stock option exercises, payments on debt borrowings and Revolving Commitment, and payments of deferred financing costs due to our debt refinancing. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 5.2 million and was primarily comprised of proceeds from exercise of stock options, partially offset by payments on finance lease obligations. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 
 On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. 
 The significant accounting policies and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 28 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 
 Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk from the information provided in "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In order to ensure that the information we must disclose in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis, we have developed and implemented disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 29 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. 
 We are subjected from time-to-time to various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings. Some of these claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings involve highly complex issues, and often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, our potential liability with respect to a large portion of such claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings cannot be estimated with certainty. Management, with the assistance of legal counsel, periodically reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses potential financial exposure. We recognize provisions for claims or pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the ultimate outcome or actual cost of settlement may materially vary from estimates. If management s estimates prove incorrect, we could incur a charge to earnings which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Class Action Litigation 
 On February 14, 2023, a plaintiff filed a purported class action lawsuit in the Stanislaus County Superior Court, California, on behalf of all non-exempt employees employed by Defendants Prime Shine LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in California any time between February 14, 2019, and the present, against Prime Shine, LLC and Does 1 20 inclusive. Plaintiff alleges eight claims for violations of the California Labor Code and one claim for violation of the California Business Professions Code. On June 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint to add a claim for penalties pursuant to the Private Attorneys General Act. Plaintiff seeks, among other things, an unspecified amount for unpaid wages, actual, consequential, and incidental losses, penalties, and attorneys fees and costs. The parties agreed to an informal exchange of information in lieu of formal discovery prior to mediation with an experienced wage-and-hour mediator. In October 2023, following mediation, both parties agreed to settle the lawsuit. A financial amount was accrued that was not material to our consolidated financial statements. A formal written settlement agreement has been executed by the parties and the Court granted preliminary approval of settlement. No putative class members objected or opted out of the settlement during the class action settlement notice period. The Court entered final approval of the class action settlement on July 19, 2024. In August 2024, the Company made the settlement payment in accordance with the Court's final approval, fulfilling our financial obligation under the terms of the settlement agreement. By mid-2025, the court clerk is expected to administratively close the case. 
 Item 1A . Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in Part I. Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Item 2 . Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 None. 
 Item 3 . Defaults Upon Senior Securities.

 Item 4 . Mine Safety Disclosures.
