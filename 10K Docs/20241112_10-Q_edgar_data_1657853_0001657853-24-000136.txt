If the Company's expectations of the operating results, both in magnitude or timing, do not materialize, or if its weighted average cost of capital increases, the Company may be required to record goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges, which could be material.

The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets (i.e., Level 1 inputs). 
 
 Public Warrants Hertz Global 
 
 Hertz Global's Public Warrants are classified as liabilities and recorded at fair value in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in accordance with the provisions of ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . See Note 10, "Public Warrants, Equity and Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share Hertz Global," for additional information. The Company calculates the fair value based on the end-of-day quoted market price (i.e., a Level 1 input). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value adjustments were gains of million and million, respectively. For the three and nine

 million and million, respectively. These amounts are recorded in change in fair value of Public Warrants in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for Hertz Global for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Exchange Feature 
 
 The Exchangeable Notes contain an embedded conversion feature, the Exchange Feature, that is required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately from the Exchangeable Notes as a derivative liability at fair value. Refer to Note 7, "Debt," and Note 12, "Financial Instruments," for further information. 
 
 The fair value of the Exchange Feature was determined using a lattice model and a with-and-without valuation methodology. The inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Exchange Feature include the probability of potential settlement scenarios, the expected timing of such settlement and an expected volatility determined by reference to historical stock volatilities. As the expected volatility input is considered unobservable, the Company has categorized the Exchange Feature as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Expected term (years) Risk-free interest rate Credit spread Expected volatility 
 
 The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Exchange Feature is expected volatility. Holding other inputs constant, an increase (decrease) in expected volatility would have resulted in a higher (lower) fair value measurement, respectively.

The Company's financial instruments, excluding the Exchange Feature as disclosed above, are priced using quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (i.e., Level 2 inputs).

 million and million, of which million and million relates to liabilities incurred by the Company's Americas RAC operations, respectively. The Company believes that its analysis is based on the most relevant information available, combined with reasonable assumptions. The liability is subject to significant uncertainties. The adequacy of the liability is monitored quarterly based on evolving accident claim history and insurance-related state legislation changes. If the Company's estimates change or if actual results differ from these assumptions, the amount of the recorded liability is adjusted to reflect these results. 
 
 Loss Contingencies 
 
 From time to time, the Company is a party to various legal proceedings, typically involving operational issues common to the vehicle rental business. The Company has summarized below the material legal proceedings to which the Company was a party during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or the period after September 30, 2024, but before the filing of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Make-Whole and Post-Petition Interest Claims On July 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ("Wells Fargo"), in its capacity as indenture trustee of (1) Unsecured Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes"), (2) Unsecured Notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes"), (3) Unsecured Notes due 2026 (the "2026 Notes") and (4) Unsecured Notes due 2028 (the "2028 Notes") issued by The Hertz Corporation (collectively, the Unsecured Notes ), filed a complaint against The Hertz Corporation and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries thereof (collectively referred to in this paragraph summary as defendants ). The filing of the complaint initiated the adversary proceeding captioned Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. The Hertz Corp., et al. in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Delaware Bankruptcy Court"), Adv. Pro. No. 21-50995 (MFW). The complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that the holders of the Unsecured Notes are entitled to payment of certain redemption premiums and post-petition interest that the holders assert total approximately million or, in the alternative, are entitled to payment of post-petition interest at a contractual rate that they assert totals approximately million. The complaint also asserts the right to pre-judgment interest from July 1, 2021 to the date of any judgment. On December 22, 2021, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court dismissed Wells Fargo s claims with respect to (i) the redemption premium allegedly owed on the 2022 Notes and the 2024 Notes and (ii) post-petition interest at the contract rate. See Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. The Hertz Corp., et al. , 637 B.R. 781 (Bankr. D. Del. Dec. 22, 2021). On November 9, 2022, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court ruled that the make-whole premium is the same as unmatured interest and is disallowed under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, granting summary judgment in the

 million for this litigation as of September 30, 2024, made up of approximately million on the underlying claims and approximately million in pre-judgment interest, which interest will continue to accrue until the date of any judgment that may be entered by the Delaware Bankruptcy Court. On October 15, 2024, the Company filed a petition with the Third Circuit for a rehearing en banc, which the Third Circuit denied on November 6, 2024. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome or timing of this litigation; if, however, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court were to enter judgment against Hertz, payment of such judgment could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Claims Related to Alleged False Arrests A group of claims involving allegations that the police detained or arrested individuals in error after the Company reported rental cars as stolen were previously advanced against the Company. These claims first arose from actions allegedly taken by the Company prior to its emergence from bankruptcy reorganization; some claims alleged post-emergence behavior by the Company. These claims have been the subject of press coverage, and the Company has received government inquiries on the matter. The Company has policies to help guide the proper treatment of its customers and to seek to protect itself against the theft of its services or assets, and the Company has taken significant steps to modernize and update those policies. In December 2022, the Company entered into settlement agreements with claimants in full and final resolutions of their claims for an aggregated amount of approximately million (the "Settlement"), all of which amount was paid by the Company during December 2022. The Settlement resolved nearly all of the false arrest-related claims being advanced in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Adv. Pro. No. 20-11247 (MFW) and state court in Delaware (captioned Flannery, et al. v. Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., et al., C.A. No. N22C-07-100 and Okoasia, et al. v. Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., et al., C.A. No. N22C-09-531 ). Also, as a result of the Settlements, state court matters pending in Pennsylvania, captioned Lovelace, et al. v. Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 220801729 , and in Florida, captioned Lizasoain, et al. v. Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 2022-015316-CA-1, were dismissed with prejudice. The Company continues to vigorously defend itself and believes that the ultimate resolution of any remaining claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Relatedly, in May 2022, the Company filed a complaint against several of its insurers seeking a determination of its rights under its commercial general liability, and directors and officers liability, insurance policies for these alleged claims in a declaratory judgment action pending in Delaware Superior Court, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., et al. v. ACE American Insurance Co., et al., C.A. No. N22C-05-130 MMJ (CCLD) . On June 30, 2023, Hertz entered into a confidential settlement agreement with ACE American Insurance Company. On July 10, 2024, the Delaware Superior Court held a hearing on cross-motions for partial summary judgment and summary judgment. The Company entered into confidential settlement agreements with some of the remaining insurers before and after the hearing. On October 8, 2024, the Delaware Superior Court denied the Company's motion for partial summary judgment and granted the cross-motions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment in favor of the remaining general liability insurers. The case remains pending against some of the remaining directors' and officers' liability insurers. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program Litigation On May 11, 2023, Angelo Cascia, a purported stockholder of Hertz Global, filed a putative class and derivative lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the "Delaware Chancery Court") against certain current and former directors of Hertz Global, Knighthead Capital Management, LLC ("Knighthead"), Certares Opportunities LLC ("Certares") and CK Amarillo. The claims in the complaint relate to the Company s share repurchase programs approved in November 2021 and June 2022. Among other allegations, the plaintiff claims Board members breached their fiduciary duties in approving these share repurchase programs and that Knighthead, Certares, and CK Amarillo were unjustly enriched because they gained a majority stake in Hertz Global as a result of share repurchases. Defendants filed their motion to dismiss the complaint on July 24, 2023. On March 11, 2024, the Delaware Chancery Court held a hearing on defendants' motion to dismiss. On June 20, 2024, the

 independent directors, to evaluate and take any necessary actions related to the remaining claims. On October 21, 2024, the Delaware Chancery Court granted a motion to stay the litigation, including all discovery, until March 21, 2025. 
 
 Securities Class Action Complaint On May 31, 2024, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (the "Florida Middle District Court"), captioned Edward M. Doller v. Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. et al . (No. 2:24-CV-00513). On September 30, 2024, an amended complaint was filed, following the Florida Middle District Court's appointment of a lead plaintiff and a lead counsel. The amended complaint asserts claims against Hertz Global, former Company CEO, Stephen M. Scherr, and former Company Chief Financial Officer, Alexandra Brooks, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, including concerning statements regarding demand for EVs. Plaintiffs assert claims on behalf of a putative class, consisting of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Hertz Global's securities between January 6, 2023 and April 24, 2024. The amended complaint seeks unspecified damages, together with interest, attorneys fees and other costs. Hertz Global filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on October 30, 2024. 
 
 Warrant Holder Litigation The holders of approximately of the outstanding Public Warrants issued by Hertz Global under the Warrant Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2021 (the Warrant Agreement ), filed a lawsuit, captioned Discovery Global Opportunity Master Fund, Ltd. v. Hertz Global Holdings, Inc ., Case No. 2024-0655 (the Action ), in the Delaware Chancery Court, on June 14, 2024. The complaint in the Action alleges generally that a Change of Control Event (as defined in the Warrant Agreement) had occurred by virtue of Hertz Global's repurchase of shares between November 2021 and December 31, 2023 and Hertz Global's incurrence of indebtedness. The complaint further asserts that, as a result of the alleged Change of Control Event, the plaintiffs are entitled to a Change of Control Payment Amount (as defined in the Warrant Agreement) in the amount of per Public Warrant, or approximately million in the aggregate, for their position. The complaint asserts claims for breach of contract and seeks a declaration from the Delaware Chancery Court that a Change of Control Event has occurred and that Hertz Global breached the Warrant Agreement by failing to redeem the warrants, monetary damages of at least million plus pre- and post-judgment interest, and an order of specific performance, requiring Hertz Global to comply with its contractual obligations under the Warrant Agreement. On June 17, 2024, Hertz Global filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which is now fully briefed. A hearing on the motion to dismiss is scheduled for November 12, 2024. 
 
 The Company has established reserves for matters where the Company believes that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Other than the aggregate reserve established for claims for self-insured liabilities and the bankruptcy-related litigation, none of those reserves are material. For matters where the Company has not established a reserve, the ultimate outcome or resolution cannot be predicted at this time, or the amount of ultimate loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. These matters are subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of the individual litigated matters is not predictable with assurance. It is possible that certain of the actions, claims, inquiries or proceedings could be decided unfavorably to the Company or any of its subsidiaries involved. Accordingly, it is possible that an adverse outcome from such a proceeding could exceed the amount accrued in an amount that could be material to the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period. 
 
 Indemnification Obligations 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company has executed contracts involving indemnification obligations customary in the relevant industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction, such as the sale of a business. These indemnification obligations might include claims relating to the following: environmental matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment-related matters; customer, supplier and other commercial contractual relationships and financial matters. Specifically, the Company has indemnified various parties for the costs associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage, recycling or disposal

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. is a holding company and its principal, wholly owned subsidiary is The Hertz Corporation. Hertz Global consolidates Hertz for financial statement purposes, and Hertz comprises approximately the entire balance of Hertz Global s assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. In addition, Hertz s operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100 of Hertz Global s revenues and operating expenses. As such, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") that follows herein is for Hertz and also applies to Hertz Global in all material respects, unless otherwise noted. Differences between the operations and results of Hertz and Hertz Global are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words we, our, us and the Company in this MD A for disclosures that relate to all of Hertz and Hertz Global. 
 
 The statements in this MD A regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The following MD A provides information that we believe to be relevant to an understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. 
 
 This MD A should be read in conjunction with the MD A presented in our 2023 Form 10-K together with the sections entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors, and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 (this "Quarterly Report"), which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including revenue earning vehicle depreciation and various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and our knowledge of actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that will affect our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 In this MD A, we refer to the following non-GAAP measure and key metrics: 
 Adjusted Corporate EBITDA important non-GAAP measure to management because it allows management to assess the operational performance of our business, exclusive of certain items, and allows management to assess the performance of the entire business on the same basis as the segment measure of profitability. Management believes that it is important to investors for the same reasons it is important to management and because it allows investors to assess our operational performance on the same basis that management uses internally. Adjusted EBITDA, the segment measure of profitability and accordingly a GAAP measure, is calculated exclusive of certain items which are largely consistent with those used in the calculation of Adjusted Corporate EBITDA. 
 Vehicle Utilization important key metric to management and investors as it is the measurement of the proportion of our vehicles that are being used to generate revenues relative to rentable fleet capacity. Higher Vehicle Utilization means more vehicles are being utilized to generate revenues. 
 Depreciation Per Unit Per Month important key metric to management and investors as depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges is one of our largest expenses for the vehicle rental business and is driven by the number of vehicles, expected residual values at the expected time of disposal and expected hold period of the vehicles. Depreciation Per Unit Per Month is reflective of how we are managing the costs of our vehicles and facilitates a comparison with other participants in the vehicle rental industry.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

Total Revenue Per Transaction Day ("Total RPD," also referred to as "pricing") important key metric to management and investors as it represents a measurement of the changes in underlying pricing in the vehicle rental business and encompasses the elements in vehicle rental pricing that management has the ability to control. 
 Total Revenue Per Unit Per Month ("Total RPU") important key metric to management and investors as it provides a measure of revenue productivity relative to the number of vehicles in our rental fleet whether owned or leased ("Average Rentable Vehicles"). Average Rentable Vehicles excludes vehicles for sale on our retail lots or actively in the process of being sold through other disposition channels. 
 Transaction Days important key metric to management and investors as it represents the number of revenue generating days ("volume"). It is used as a component to measure Total RPD and Vehicle Utilization. Transaction Days represent the total number of 24-hour periods, with any partial period counted as one Transaction Day, that vehicles were on rent (the period between when a rental contract is opened and closed) in a given period. Thus, it is possible for a vehicle to attain more than one Transaction Day in a 24-hour period. 
 
 Our non-GAAP measure and key metrics should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The above non-GAAP measure and key metrics are defined, and the non-GAAP measure is reconciled to its most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, in the "Footnotes to the Results of Operations and Selected Operating Data by Segment Tables" section of this MD A. 
 
 OUR COMPANY 
 
 Hertz Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2015 to serve as the top-level holding company for Rental Car Intermediate Holdings, LLC, which wholly owns Hertz, Hertz Global's primary operating company. Hertz was incorporated in Delaware in 1967 and is a successor to corporations that have been engaged in the vehicle rental and leasing business since 1918. 
 
 We operate our vehicle rental business globally from company-owned and franchisee locations in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East and New Zealand. We also sell vehicles through Hertz Car Sales. 
 
 OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT 
 
 Our Business 
 
 We are engaged principally in the business of renting vehicles primarily through our Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands. Our profitability is primarily a function of the volume, mix and pricing of rental transactions and the utilization of vehicles, the related ownership cost of vehicles and other operating costs. Significant changes in the purchase price or residual values of vehicles or interest rates can have a significant effect on our profitability depending on our ability to adjust pricing for these changes. We continue to balance our mix of EVs, non-program vehicles and program vehicles based on market conditions, including residual values. Our business requires significant expenditures for vehicles, and as such, we require substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures. 
 
 Our strategy is focused on excellence in execution of our rental operations, presenting distinct product offerings through each of our brands, building on our leadership in ride share and selling vehicles from the fleet directly to consumers. 
 
 Our revenues are primarily derived from rental and related charges and consist of worldwide vehicle rental revenues from all company-operated vehicle rental operations and charges to customers for the reimbursement of costs incurred relating to airport concession fees and vehicle license fees, the fueling and electric charging of vehicles and revenues associated with value-added services, including the sale of loss or collision damage waivers, theft protection, liability and personal accident/effects insurance coverage, premium emergency roadside service and

other products and fees. Also included are collections from customers for vehicle damages, ancillary revenues associated with retail vehicle sales and certain royalty fees from our franchisees (such fees are approximately 2 of total revenues each period). 
 
 Our expenses primarily consist of: 
 Direct vehicle and operating expense ("DOE"), primarily wages and related benefits; commissions and concession fees paid to airport authorities, travel agents and others; facility, self-insurance and reservation costs; and other costs relating to the operation and rental of revenue earning vehicles, such as collision and damage, maintenance, fuel and electric charging costs; 
 Depreciation expense and lease charges, net relating to revenue earning vehicles, including gains and losses and related costs associated with the disposal of vehicles; 
 Depreciation and amortization expense relating to non-vehicle assets; 
 Selling, general and administrative expense ("SG A"), which includes advertising costs and administrative personnel costs, along with costs for information technology and business transformation initiatives; and 
 Interest expense, net. 
 
 Our vehicle rental operations are a seasonal business, with decreased levels of business in the winter months and heightened activity during the spring and summer months ("our peak season") for the majority of countries where we generate our revenues. To accommodate increased demand, we seek to increase our available fleet and staff. As demand declines, we seek to reduce our fleet and staff accordingly. As a result, we strive to maintain a flexible workforce, with a significant number of part-time and seasonal workers. A number of our other major operating costs, including airport concession fees, commissions and vehicle liability expenses, are directly related to revenues or transaction volumes. Certain operating expenses, including real estate taxes, rent, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other facility-related expenses, and minimum staffing costs, remain fixed and cannot be adjusted for demand. 
 
 Our Reportable Segments 
 
 We have identified two reportable segments, which are consistent with our operating segments and organized based on the products and services provided and the geographic areas in which business is conducted, as follows: 
 
 Americas RAC Rental of vehicles, as well as sales of value-added services, in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 
 International RAC Rental of vehicles, as well as sales of value-added services, in locations other than the U.S., Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean. 
 
 In addition to the above reportable segments, we have corporate operations. We assess performance and allocate resources based upon the financial information for our operating segments. 

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Operating Overview 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the sale of the EV Disposal Groups was approximately 95 complete. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred incremental depreciation charges, primarily in the first half of 2024, of 176 million for the write-down on the vehicles, of which 165 million and 11 million are associated with our Americas RAC and International RAC segments, respectively, and 47 million for losses incurred on the vehicles sold, primarily in our Americas RAC segment.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Long-Lived Assets 
 
 Our long-lived assets consist primarily of revenue earning vehicles, ROU assets and property and equipment. We make estimates about the expected economic lives, projected residual values and the potential for impairment. We amortize long-lived assets using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors which could be indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, (i) significant decrease in market prices of the assets, (ii) current period operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses and (iii) significant changes in the estimated useful lives. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the estimated fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less costs to sell. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, at the conclusion of our historical peak rental season, there was a reduction in the cash flow projections in the Americas RAC and International RAC segments, indicating that the carrying values of their long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The reduction was largely attributed to the acceleration of the rental fleet rotation in our segments, where shortening the useful life reduced the potential future cash flows expected to be earned from the fleet. Operating cash flow projections also deteriorated from delayed timing of operating cost improvements and longer timeframes associated with revenue maximization initiatives. As a result, we tested the recoverability of our Long-Lived Assets in our Americas RAC and International RAC segments and determined that an impairment existed. 
 
 Effective August 31, 2024, the Long-Lived Assets were written down to their estimated fair values, resulting in the recognition of an impairment charge of 1.0 billion, of which 923 million and 125 million were associated with our revenue earning vehicles and ROU assets, respectively. As the Long-Lived Assets impairment was recognized as of August 31, 2024, depreciation expense during the third quarter of 2024 includes two months of depreciation at pre-impairment rates and one month at post-impairment rates. 
 
 To the extent there are further changes in market conditions or the performance of our long-lived assets, there is a possibility that we could incur additional impairments in the future. Refer to Note 3, "Long-Lived Assets Impairment," in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for additional information. 
 
 Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we tested the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets due to the impact related to the reduction in the cash flow projections in our Americas RAC and International RAC segments. The quantitative fair value test utilized our most recent cash flow projections, including a range of potential outcomes, along with a long-term growth rate of 2 and a range of discount rates between 20.0 and 12.0 . Based on the quantitative tests, no impairments were recorded in the third quarter of 2024. However, the fair value of the Dollar and Thrifty tradename, which is an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in our Americas RAC segment was in excess by 12 of the carrying values of 934 million. 
 
 Further deterioration in our cash flow projections or the weighted average cost of capital assumptions may result in an impairment charge to earnings in future quarters. We will continue to closely monitor actual results versus our expectations and the resulting impact to our assumptions about future estimated cash flows and the weighted average cost of capital. If our expectations of the operating results, both in magnitude or timing, do not materialize, or if our weighted average cost of capital increases, we may be required to record goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges, which could be material.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Total revenues decreased 127 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, resulting from a decrease of 110 million and 16 million in our Americas RAC and International RAC segments, respectively. The decrease in total revenues was due primarily to lower volume. 
 
 Depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net increased 436 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, of which 408 million and 29 million were attributed to our Americas RAC and International RAC segments, respectively. Depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net increased due primarily to (i) deterioration in the residual values at the expected time of disposal, (ii) decreased holding periods resulting from the acceleration of our rental fleet rotation and (ii) per unit losses recognized on vehicle dispositions during the third quarter of 2024 compared to per unit gains recognized in the same period in 2023, partially offset by lower Average Vehicles. We expect that depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net will continue to be impacted during the fourth quarter of 2024 by an uncertain residual environment and heightened disposals as part of our fleet refresh initiatives versus the same period in 2023. 
 
 DOE decreased 30 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, resulting from a decrease of 39 million in our Americas RAC segment, partially offset by an increase of 13 million in our International RAC segment. DOE decreased due primarily to lower volume largely in our Americas RAC segment, partially offset by increased self-insurance liabilities as a result of adverse experience and case development and increased vehicle in-fleeting costs related to our accelerated fleet rotation in 2024.

SG A decreased 19 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 driven primarily by a decrease of 36 million associated with our corporate operations, partially offset by an increase of 16 million in our International RAC segment. The decrease in SG A associated with our corporate operations was due primarily to intercompany royalty assessment fees received from our International RAC and Americas RAC segments, reduced non-cash stock-based compensation charges and decreased third-party spend. SG A in our International RAC segment increased due primarily to higher intercompany royalty assessment fees paid to our corporate operations and the release of a litigation reserve in the 2023 period. 
 
 Vehicle interest expense, net decreased 5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to interest rate mix, partially offset by higher interest rates. 
 
 Non-vehicle interest expense, net increased 27 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to higher debt levels and higher benchmark rates. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized expense of 288 million in our corporate operations related to an increase to an existing bankruptcy-related litigation reserve, as disclosed in Note 14, "Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments," in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of 1.0 billion associated with the Long-Lived Assets in our Americas RAC and International RAC segments, as disclosed in Note 3, "Long-Lived Assets Impairment," in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a tax benefit of 287 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 17 . For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a tax benefit of 68 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of (30) . The change in taxes in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was driven primarily by lower pretax income, changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and lower estimated EV credits. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Total revenues decreased 178 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to lower pricing, partially offset by higher volume. Total revenues in our Americas RAC segment decreased 189 million due primarily to lower pricing, partially offset by an increase of 9 million in our International RAC segment resulting primarily from higher volume. 
 
 Depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net increased 1.7 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which 1.6 billion is attributable to our Americas RAC segment. Depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net increased due primarily to (i) deterioration in the residual values at the expected time of disposal, (ii) decreased holding periods resulting from the acceleration of our rental fleet rotation (iii) per unit losses recognized on vehicle dispositions during the nine months ended nine month ended September 30, 2024 compared to per unit gains recognized in the same period in 2023 and (iv) write-downs on the carrying values of the EVs classified as held for sale, primarily in the first half of 2024 in our Americas RAC segment. We expect that depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net will continue to be impacted during the fourth quarter of 2024 by an uncertain residual environment and heightened disposals as part of our fleet refresh initiatives versus the same period in 2023. 
 
 DOE increased 210 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with increases of 133 million and 80 million in our Americas RAC and International RAC segments, respectively. The increase in DOE was due primarily to increased self-insurance liabilities as a result of adverse experience and case development, increased collision and damage costs, a loss recovery settlement in the second quarter of 2023, increased vehicle in-fleeting costs and higher personnel costs.

SG A decreased 121 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven primarily by a decrease of 166 million associated with our corporate operations, partially offset by increases of 39 million and 7 million in our International RAC and Americas RAC segments, respectively. The decrease in SG A associated with our corporate operations was due primarily to a non-cash stock-based compensation gain related to forfeitures of former CEO awards in March 2024, intercompany royalty assessment fees received from our International RAC and Americas RAC segments, decreased third-party spend and reduced non-cash stock-based compensation charges, partially offset by increased restructuring related costs. SG A in our International RAC segment increased due primarily to higher intercompany royalty assessment fees paid to our corporate operations, increased advertising spend, increased restructuring related costs and the release of a litigation reserve in the 2023 period. SG A in our Americas RAC segment increased due primarily to increased restructuring related costs, higher intercompany royalty assessment fees paid to our corporate operations and increased personnel costs, partially offset by reduced advertising spend.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

Depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net for International RAC in the third quarter of 2024 increased 29 million compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to (i) per unit losses recognized on vehicle dispositions in the third quarter of 2024 compared to per unit gains recognized in the same period in 2023 and (ii) deterioration in residual values at the expected time of disposal. We expect that depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net will continue to be impacted during the fourth quarter of 2024 by an uncertain residual environment and heightened disposals as part of our fleet refresh initiatives versus the same period in 2023. 
 
 DOE for International RAC increased 13 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to higher personnel costs, increased vehicle in-fleeting costs, increased self-insurance liabilities as a result of adverse experience and case development and increased collision and damage costs. 
 
 SG A for International RAC in the third quarter of 2024 increased 16 million compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to higher intercompany royalty assessment fees paid to our corporate operations and the release of a litigation reserve in the 2023 period. 
 
 Vehicle interest expense for International RAC increased 3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to increased debt levels, partially offset by lower market interest rates. 
 
 International RAC recognized an impairment charge of 183 million in the third quarter of 2024 associated with its Long-Lived Assets, as disclosed in Note 3, "Long-Lived Assets Impairment," in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Total revenues for International RAC increased 9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher volume, partially offset by lower pricing. Transaction Days increased driven primarily by higher volume in certain leisure categories, primarily in Europe. Total RPD declined resulting primarily from lower rates in certain leisure categories. 
 
 Depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net for International RAC increased 162 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to (i) per unit losses recognized on vehicle dispositions in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to per unit gains recognized in the same period in 2023 and (ii) deterioration in the residual values at the expected time of disposal. We expect that depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net will continue to be impacted during the fourth quarter of 2024 by an uncertain residual environment and heightened disposals as part of our fleet refresh initiatives versus the same period in 2023. 
 
 DOE for International RAC increased 80 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher personnel costs, increased collision and damage costs and increased self-insurance liabilities as a result of adverse experience and case development. 
 
 SG A for International RAC increased 39 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher intercompany royalty assessment fees paid to our corporate operations, increased advertising spend, increased restructuring related costs and the release of a litigation reserve in the 2023 period. 
 
 Vehicle interest expense for International RAC increased 17 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to higher debt levels and higher market interest rates.

(c) Vehicle Utilization is calculated by dividing total Transaction Days by Available Car Days. Available Car Days represents Average Rentable Vehicles multiplied by the number of days in a given period. Average Rentable Vehicles excludes vehicles for sale on our retail lots or actively in the process of being sold through other disposition channels and is determined using a simple average of such vehicles at the beginning and end of a given period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our U.S. and international operations are funded by cash provided by operating activities and by extensive financing arrangements in the U.S. and internationally. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 501 million of cash and cash equivalents and 404 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, 191 million of cash and cash equivalents and 121 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents were held by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. We continue to assert non-permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings that give rise to excess cash, provided such cash can be remitted in a tax efficient manner. 
 
 We believe that cash and cash equivalents generated by our operations and cash received on the disposal of vehicles, together with amounts available under various liquidity facilities and refinancing options available to us in the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities and obligations for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. 

Cash Flows Hertz 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Hertz had cash and cash equivalents of 501 million and 764 million, respectively, and restricted cash and cash equivalents of 404 million and 442 million, respectively. The following table summarizes the net change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents for the periods shown:

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flows from operating activities decreased 94 million period over period due primarily to a 876 million change in net income, as adjusted for non-cash and non-operating items, inclusive of a 1.0 billion Long-Lived Assets impairment recognized in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by a 782 million change in working capital accounts. Cash flows from working capital accounts increased due primarily to an increase to an existing bankruptcy-related litigation reserve recorded in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease in non-vehicle receivables due to timing, lower value added tax receivables, an increase in self-insurance liabilities as a result of adverse experience and case development and non-recurring capital outlays for certain prepaids in 2023. 
 
 Our primary investing activities relate to the acquisition and disposal of revenue earning vehicles. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was an 841 million decrease in the cash used in investing activities period over period due primarily to a 932 million decrease in revenue earning vehicle expenditures, net, partially offset by 168 million of net proceeds received in March 2023 from the sale of certain non-vehicle capital assets as disclosed in Note 4, "Divestitures," in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. The decrease in revenue earning vehicle expenditures, net primarily resulted from decreased vehicle acquisitions resulting in part from our fleet-related initiatives and higher fleet levels entering 2024 and increased vehicle dispositions. 
 
 Net financing cash inflows were 1.2 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 billion in the 2023 period. The 683 million decrease in cash inflows is due primarily to a decrease of 2.0 billion in net proceeds from vehicle debt as a result of less issuances in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparable period in 2023. Cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by a 1.1 billion increase in net proceeds from non-vehicle debt resulting from issuances of the First Lien Senior Notes and the Exchangeable Notes in June 2024, along with outstanding draws on the First Lien RCF in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. A reduction in dividends paid to Hertz Holdings of 265 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were primarily used for share repurchases in the comparable period in 2023, further increased cash inflows during 2024. 
 
 Cash Flows Hertz Global 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Hertz Global had cash and cash equivalents of 501 million and 764 million, respectively, and restricted cash and cash equivalents of 404 million and 442 million, respectively. The following table summarizes the net change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents for Hertz Global for the periods shown: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2024 2023 Change Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,810 1,910 (100) Investing activities (3,267) (4,108) 841 Financing activities 1,156 1,833 (677) Effect of exchange rate changes 3 (3) Net change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents (301) (362) 61 
 
 Fluctuations in operating, investing and financing cash flows from period to period were due to the same factors as those disclosed for Hertz above, with the exception of any cash inflows or outflows related to the issuance or repurchase of our common stock and the exercise of Public Warrants. See Note 10, "Public Warrants, Equity and Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share Hertz Global," in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

Share Repurchase Programs for Common Stock 
 
 In June 2022, Hertz Global's independent Audit Committee recommended, and its Board approved, the 2022 Share Repurchase Program that authorized additional repurchases of up to an incremental 2.0 billion worth of shares of Hertz Global's outstanding common stock. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program, announced on June 15, 2022, has no initial time limit, does not obligate Hertz Global to acquire any particular amount of common stock and can be discontinued at any time. However, during the effective period of Amendment No. 8, as disclosed in Note 7, "Debt," in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, the repurchase of shares is not permitted commencing April 16, 2024 through April 1, 2025. Since the inception of the 2022 Share Repurchase Program, a total of 66,684,169 shares of Hertz Global's common stock have been repurchased in open-market transactions for an aggregate purchase price of 1.1 billion, excluding applicable excise tax. There were no share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Common shares repurchased are included in treasury stock in the accompanying Hertz Global unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Subsequent to the expiration of Amendment No. 8, any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of Hertz Global's management through a variety of methods, such as open-market transactions (including pre-set trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act), privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchases and other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. There can be no assurance as to the timing or number of shares of any repurchases. 
 
 Debt Financing 
 
 Refer to Note 7, "Debt," in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for information on our outstanding debt obligations and our borrowing capacity and availability under our revolving credit facilities as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash paid for interest on vehicle debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 385 million and 341 million, respectively. The 44 million increase in cash paid for vehicle debt interest is due primarily to higher interest rates and higher debt levels. Cash paid for interest on non-vehicle debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 222 million and 170 million, respectively. The 52 million increase in cash paid for non-vehicle debt interest is due primarily to higher debt levels and higher outstanding borrowings on the First Lien RCF. 
 
 Our available corporate liquidity, which excludes unused commitments under our vehicle debt, was as follows: 
 (In millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 501 764 Availability under the First Lien RCF 1,147 1,266 Corporate liquidity 1,648 2,030 
 
 Non-Vehicle Debt 
 
 First Lien Credit Agreement 
 
 In April 2024, Amendment No. 8 became effective and requires a First Lien Ratio of less than or equal to 5.0x in the second and third quarters of 2024 and 4.75x in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. Amendment No. 8 also contains a minimum liquidity covenant of 400 million for each month ending in the second and third quarters of 2024 and 500 million for each month ending in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. Liquidity as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement may be materially different than corporate liquidity presented above. Amendment No. 8 also adds certain limitations on Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments (each as

defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement). Under the terms of Amendment No. 8, the increased First Lien Ratio, minimum liquidity covenant, and limitations on Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments will sunset on the first day of the second quarter of 2025. 
 
 In July 2024, consistent with obligations arising from the issuance of the First Lien Senior Notes and the Exchangeable Notes, as disclosed below, Hertz Holdings entered into a parent guarantee agreement with the administrative agent for the First Lien Credit Agreement. Prior to the issuance of each of the First Lien Senior Notes and the Exchangeable Notes, Hertz Holdings did not guarantee the obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement. 
 
 First Lien Senior Notes 
 
 In June 2024, Hertz issued 750 million in aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Senior Notes, which are guaranteed by Hertz Holdings, Rental Car Intermediate Holdings, LLC and each of Hertz s direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries that are guarantors under the First Lien Credit Agreement. The First Lien Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 12.625 per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning in January 2025. The First Lien Senior Notes mature July 2029. Proceeds from the issuance of the First Lien Senior Notes were used to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings of the First Lien RCF. 
 
 Exchangeable Notes 
 
 In June 2024, Hertz issued 250 million in aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes, which are guaranteed by Hertz Holdings, Rental Car Intermediate Holdings, LLC and each of Hertz s direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries that are guarantors under the First Lien Credit Agreement. The Exchangeable Notes bear PIK interest payable semi-annually in arrears on July 15 and January 15 of each year, beginning in January 2025. The Exchangeable Notes mature on the Maturity Date, unless repurchased, redeemed or exchanged in accordance with their terms prior to the Maturity Date. 
 
 Prior to April 15, 2029, the Exchangeable Notes will be exchangeable only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods. Thereafter, the Exchangeable Notes will be exchangeable at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the Maturity Date. The Exchangeable Notes will be exchangeable by holders into shares of Hertz Global common stock, cash or a combination of common stock and cash, at our election, at an initial exchange rate of 150.9388 shares per 1,000 principal amount of Exchangeable Notes, corresponding to an initial exchange price of 6.6252 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. Proceeds from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes were used to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings of the First Lien RCF. 
 
 We may redeem the Exchangeable Notes on or after July 20, 2027 and on or prior to the 31st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, if the last reported sale price per share of Hertz Global common stock has been at least 250 of the exchange price for the Exchangeable Notes for certain specified periods. We may redeem all (but not part) of the Exchangeable Notes at a cash redemption price equal to the initial principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be redeemed plus PIK interest on such Exchangeable Notes for each interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date plus accrued and unpaid PIK interest on such Exchangeable Notes to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 
 At the time of issuance, certain investors affiliated with CK Amarillo, which is an affiliate of Hertz Holdings, purchased approximately 44 million of the Exchangeable Notes as further disclosed in Note 15, "Related Party Transactions," in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Upon issuance, we bifurcated the Exchange Feature from the Exchangeable Notes for accounting purposes utilizing applicable guidance. As a result, we recognized a debt discount of 68 million within non-vehicle debt, representing the initial fair value of the Exchange Feature. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Exchange Feature was 54 million. Refer to Note 13, "Fair Value Measurements," in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for further details.

 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, proceeds for non-vehicle capital assets decreased by 159 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily in our Americas RAC segment, resulting from the sale of certain non-vehicle capital assets in March 2023 as disclosed in Note 4, "Divestitures," in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, expenditures for non-vehicle capital assets decreased by 70 million compared to the 2023 period, primarily in our Americas RAC segment and corporate operations, driven in part by a non-recurring capital outlay for certain non-vehicle prepaids in the 2023 period and reduced location refurbishment spend.

 b. Cause means, as determined by the person or entity that supervises or manages Executive (A) willful and continued failure to perform substantially Executive s material duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from 
 Executive s incapacity as a result of physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance specifying the manner in which Executive has not performed such duties is delivered to Executive by the person or entity that supervises or manages Executive, (B) engaging in willful and serious misconduct that is injurious to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (C) one or more acts of fraud or material personal dishonesty resulting in or intended to result in personal enrichment at the expense of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (D) substantial abusive use of alcohol, drugs, or similar substances that, in the sole judgment of the Company, impairs Executive s job performance, (E) material violation of any Company policy that results in harm to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (F) conviction of (or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to) a felony or of any crime (whether or not a felony) involving moral turpitude, (G) conviction of (or plea of guilty or nolo contendere) to a securities law violation that is materially injurious to the Company or its subsidiaries, or (H) a material breach of the representations made by Executive in Executive s Offer Letter. If a circumstance constituting Cause is curable, Executive shall be provided written notice of the circumstance and 30 days from the date of such notice to cure it. Executive shall not be provided more than one opportunity to cure with respect to the same or similar circumstances. Any determination that Executive s employment will be terminated for Cause shall be made by the person or entity that supervises or manages Executive following notice to Executive and an opportunity for Executive and his counsel to be heard by the person or entity that supervises or manages Executive. A termination of employment for Cause shall include a determination following Executive s termination of employment for any reason that the circumstances existed prior to such termination for the Company to 
 have terminated Executive s employment for Cause. 
 c. Good Reason means, without Executive s prior written consent, (A) reduction by the Company of Executive s base salary or target annual bonus in a manner that is not consistent with a broad-based reduction applicable to all members of the senior management team, (B) a material diminution in Executive s title, duties or responsibilities, or (C) a change in Executive s reporting relationship such that he no longer reports to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

such action, (ii) the Company fails to cure such action within 30 days of such notice, and 
 (iii) if the Company fails to cure such action, Executive terminates his employment 
 within fifteen (15) days after the end of the Company s cure period. 
 EXHIBIT B 
 
 PERFORMANCE VESTING OF THE SIGN-ON PSU AWARD 
 
 Performance vests as follows when the 90-day weighted average closing price of the Company s common stock exceeds the applicable price set forth below provided, that PSUs that do not vest prior to the fifth anniversary of the Start Date shall be forfeited in their entirety. 
 
 Tranche 
 Regular Vesting Company Stock Price Metric 
 20 of Sign-On PSU Award 
 (i.e., one-fifth of the performance component) 
 10.00 
 20 of Sign-On PSU Award 
 (i.e., one-fifth of the performance component) 
 12.50 
 20 of Sign-On PSU Award 
 (i.e., one-fifth of the performance component) 
 15.00 
 20 of Sign-On PSU Award 
 (i.e., one-fifth of the performance component) 
 17.50 
 20 of Sign-On PSU Award 
 (i.e., one-fifth of the performance component) 
 20.00 

Upon a Good Leaver Termination, any PSUs that have time vested (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting that applies on such Good Leaver Termination) but not performance vested remain outstanding and eligible to vest for 12 months following such Good Leaver Termination. PSUs that have not fully vested will be forfeited upon any other termination not expressly described in this paragraph. 
 
 Example Executive receives an award of 500,000 PSUs. 
 
 Example 1 Assume the Company achieves the 10.00 Stock Price Metric on the first anniversary of the Start Date. In that case, 20 of the PSUs (100,000 shares) would have performance vested and 33.33 of the PSUs that have performance vested would also have time vested. Accordingly, 33,333 PSUs (i.e. 500,000 PSUs x 20 x 33.33 would be fully vested as of such date. Subject to Executive s continued employment with the Company, an additional 33,333 of the PSUs would time vest on each of the next two anniversaries of the Grant Date even if the Company s stock price declines to less than 10.00. 
 
 Example 2 Assume the same facts as Example 1 and that the Company achieves the 12.50 Stock Price Metric on the second anniversary of the Grant Date. In that case, 40 of the PSUs (200,000 shares) would have performance vested and 66.66 of the PSUs that have performance vested would also have time vested. Accordingly, 133,333 PSUs (i.e. 500,000 PSUs x 40 x 66.66 would be fully vested as of such date. Subject to Executive s continued employment with the Company, an additional 66,667 of the PSUs would time vest on the next anniversary of the Grant Date even if the Company s stock price declines to less than 12.50.
