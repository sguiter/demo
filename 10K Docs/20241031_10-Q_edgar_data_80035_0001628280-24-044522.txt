 million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. An actual valuation of inventories under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of the year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs. Because these estimates are subject to change and may be different than the actual inventory levels and costs at the end of the year, interim results are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. During the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net change in LIFO inventories resulted in expense of million and million, respectively, to Cost of products sold. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net change in LIFO inventories resulted in expense of million and of million, respectively, to Cost of products sold.

 and , respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to limitations on the deductibility of compensation and a lower excess tax benefit on share-based compensation which was partially offset by the favorable impact from the mix of earned income in certain foreign jurisdictions. 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s effective tax rate was and , respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the favorable impact from discrete benefits recorded as a result of amending prior year federal tax returns and an increase in excess tax benefits on share-based compensation in relation to overall lower pre-tax book income. 
 The Company provides valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) is intended to help the readers of our financial statements better understand our results of operations, financial condition and present business environment. The MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Preformed Line Products Company (the Company , PLPC , we , us , or our was incorporated in Ohio in 1947. We are an international designer and manufacturer of products and systems employed in the construction and maintenance of overhead and underground networks for the energy, telecommunication, cable operators, information (data communication), and other similar industries. Our primary products support, protect, connect, terminate, and secure cables and wires. We provide helical solutions, connectors, fiber optic and copper splice closures, solar hardware mounting applications, and electric vehicle charging station foundations. We also provide aerial drone inspection services for utility assets including transmission and distribution power lines, substations, and generation facilities . We are respected around the world for quality, dependability and market-leading customer service. Our goal is to continue to achieve profitable growth as a leader in the research, innovation, development, manufacture, and marketing of technically advanced products and services related to energy, communications and cable systems and to take advantage of this leadership position to sell additional quality products in familiar markets. We have sales and manufacturing operations in 20 different countries. 
 We report our segments in four geographic regions: PLP-USA (including corporate), The Americas (includes operations in North and South America, excluding PLP-USA), EMEA (Europe, Middle East Africa) and Asia-Pacific, in accordance with accounting standards codified in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280, Segment Reporting . Each segment distributes a full range of our primary products. Our PLP-USA segment is comprised of our U.S. operations manufacturing our traditional products primarily supporting our domestic energy, telecommunications, solar framing products and inspection services. Our other three segments, The Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific, support our energy, telecommunications, data communication, solar and other products in each respective geographical region. 
 The segment managers responsible for each region report directly to the Company s Executive Chairman, who is the chief operating decision maker, and are accountable for the financial results and performance of their entire segment for which they are responsible. The business components within each segment are managed to maximize the results of the entire operating segment and the Company rather than the results of any individual business component of the segment. 
 We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on several factors primarily based on sales and net income. 
 
 PREFACE 
 The following discussion describes our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Our discussions of the financial results include non-GAAP measures (e.g., foreign currency impact) to provide additional information concerning our financial results and provide information that we believe is useful to the readers of our financial statements in the assessment of our performance and operating trends. 
 Net sales of 147.0 million decreased 13.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 year-over-year and net sales of 426.6 million decreased 97.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 year-over-year, mainly due to the continued inventory destocking at PLP-USA communications markets' customers and distributors. The inflationary headwinds we experienced in 2022 and early 2023 related to raw materials, specifically plastic resins, aluminum and sand (grit), have generally subsided. Costs related to shipping and freight have similarly fallen from their 2022 peak. Decreases in these underlying costs along with the impacts of our previous price increases benefited gross margins in 2023 and have not meaningfully impacted the results for the third quarter or nine months ended September 30, 2024. If inflationary pressures increase again, it may require further price adjustments to maintain profit margin, and any price increases may have a negative effect on demand. 
 Our financial statements are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. The fluctuations of foreign currencies during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 had a unfavorable impact on net sales of 0.8 million and 1.1 million, respectively. The fluctuations on foreign currencies during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 had an unfavorable impact on net income of 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively. The fluctuations of foreign currencies during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 had a favorable impact on net sales of 1.4 million and unfavorable impact on net sales of 5.6 million, respectively. The fluctuations on foreign currencies during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 had an unfavorable impact on net income of 0.1 million and 0.7 million, respectively. On a reportable

 segment basis, the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales and net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was as follows: 
 Foreign Currency Translation Impact Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 (Thousands of dollars) Net Sales Net Income Net Sales Net Income The Americas (1,668) (131) (1,283) (136) EMEA 576 (6) 1,422 69 Asia-Pacific 283 9 (1,266) (105) Total (809) (128) (1,127) (172) 
 Although elevated inventory levels in the PLP-USA communications markets and other market headwinds have impacted our 2024 results, we believe our business portfolio and our financial position are sound and strategically well-positioned. We remain focused on assessing our global market opportunities and overall manufacturing capacity in conjunction with the requirements of local manufacturing in the markets that we serve. As necessary, we will modify redundant processes and further utilize our global manufacturing network to manage costs, increase sales volume and deliver value to our customers. Period cost containment has been a priority for the Company in 2024, shown through a reduction in costs and expenses. We have continued to invest in the business to expand into new markets for the Company, evaluate strategic mergers and acquisitions, improve efficiency, develop new products and increase our capacity. As of September 30, 2024, our liquidity remains strong with our bank debt to equity percentage at 8.2 . We can borrow needed funds at a competitive interest rate under the Facility.

 PLP-USA costs and expenses of 17.4 million decreased 1.8 million, or 10 year-over-year. PLP-USA s decrease was primarily attributable to lower selling costs and lower personnel costs, primarily as a result of cost containment efforts. International costs and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were favorably impacted by 0.3 million when local currencies were translated to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of costs and expenses excludes the effect of currency translation. The Americas costs and expenses of 5.0 million decreased 0.5 million primarily due to a one-time legal settlement in the third quarter of 2023. EMEA costs and expenses of 7.2 million increased by 1.4 million primarily due to increased selling, general, and administrative costs and the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. Asia-Pacific costs and expenses of 5.8 million increased 2.5 million primarily due to a one-time gain of 2.5 million on the sale of capital assets in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Other income (expense), net. Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was favorable by 0.5 million when compared to Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 0.5 million. The favorable movement was due to lower interest expense from reduced debt balances and higher interest income earned on cash balances in certain international jurisdictions. 
 Income taxes. Income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2.7 million and 4.4 million based on pre-tax income of 10.4 million and 19.6 million, respectively. The tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 26 and 23 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the effective tax rate for the same period in 2023 mainly due to limitations on the deductibility of compensation and a lower excess tax benefit on share-based compensation which was partially offset by the favorable impact from the mix of earned income in certain foreign jurisdictions. 
 Net income. As a result of the preceding items, net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.7 million, compared to 15.1 million for 2023. Excluding the effect of currency translation, net income decreased 7.3 million as summarized in the following table. The decrease in net income was due to decreases in operating income described above, partially offset by lower interest expense and lower tax expense:

The following discussion of gross profit changes excludes the effects of currency translation. The Americas gross profit decreased 5.3 million, or 22 , which was primarily the result of lower sales volumes.

 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our critical accounting policies are consistent with the information set forth in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 8, 2024 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are, therefore, not presented herein. 
 
 WORKING CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Management Assessment of Liquidity 
 We measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short-term and long-term operating needs, repay debt, fund additional investments, including acquisitions, and make dividend payments to shareholders. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, cash dividends, business acquisitions and access to bank lines of credit. 
 Our investments include expenditures required for equipment and facilities as well as expenditures in support of our strategic initiatives. During the first nine months of 2024, we used cash of 11.2 million for capital expenditures. We ended the first nine months of 2024 with 47.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (collectively, Cash ). Our Cash is held in various locations throughout the world. At September 30, 2024, the majority of our Cash was held outside the U.S. We expect most accumulated non-U.S. Cash balances will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future operating cash flows, use of U.S. Cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources. We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing financial statements for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity from customer credit issues. 
 Total debt, including notes payable, at September 30, 2024 was 35.2 million. At September 30, 2024, our unused availability under our credit facility (the "Facility") was 77.2 million and our bank debt to equity percentage was 8.2 . The Facility contains, among other provisions, requirements for maintaining levels of net worth and profitability. At September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. 
 Our Asia-Pacific segment had 0.1 million and 0.2 million in restricted cash for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The restricted cash was used to secure bank guarantees and is included in Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 On January 19, 2021, the Company received funding for a term loan from PNC Equipment Finance, LLC in the principal amount of 20.5 million for the full amount of the purchase price for a new corporate aircraft. The term of the loan is 120 months at a fixed interest rate of 2.744 . The loan is payable in 119 equal monthly installments, which commenced on March 1, 2021 with a final payment of any outstanding principal and accrued interest due and payable on the final monthly payment date. Of the 13.2 million outstanding on this debt facility at September 30, 2024, 2.1 million was classified as current. The loan is secured by the aircraft. 
 We expect that our major source of funding for 2024 and beyond will be our operating cash flows, our existing Cash as well as our Facility agreement. Except for current earnings in certain jurisdictions, our operating income is deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We believe our future operating cash flows will be more than sufficient to cover debt repayments, other contractual obligations, capital expenditures and dividends for the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we believe our borrowing capacity provides substantial financial resources, if needed, to supplement funding of capital expenditures and/or acquisitions. We also believe that we can further expand our borrowing capacity, if necessary; however, we do not believe we would increase our debt to a level that would have a material adverse impact upon results of operations or financial condition.

 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 43.4 million compared to 88.4 million in the comparable prior year nine-month period. The 45.0 million decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.7 million compared to 36.7 million in the comparable prior year nine-month period. The 29.0 million change was primarily a result of decreases in acquisition activity and capital expenditures during the current period. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 40.8 million compared to 45.5 million in the comparable prior year nine-month period. The 4.7 million change was primarily the result of increased net payments of long-term debt and decreased purchases of common shares from related parties. 
 We have commitments under operating leases primarily for office and manufacturing space, transportation equipment, office and computer equipment and finance leases primarily for equipment. At September 30, 2024, we had 1.6 million of current operating lease liabilities and 7.0 million of noncurrent operating lease liabilities. Total liabilities related to finance lease obligations were less than 0.6 million at September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total outstanding guarantees of 12.2 million. Additionally, certain domestic and foreign customers require the Company to issue letters of credit or performance bonds as a condition of placing an order. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total outstanding letters of credit of 1.0 million. 
 The Company has borrowing facilities at certain of its foreign subsidiaries, which consist of overdraft lines, working capital credit lines, and facilities for the issuance of letters of credit and short-term borrowing needs. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, 9.3 million and 13.3 million was outstanding, of which 8.6 million and 11.4 million were classified as current, respectively. These facilities support commitments made in the ordinary course of business.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company operates manufacturing facilities and offices around the world and uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance the Company s global operations. As a result, the Company is subject to business risks inherent in non-U.S. activities, including political and economic uncertainty, import and export limitations and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company believes that the political and economic risks related to the Company s international operations are mitigated due to the geographic diversity in which the Company s international operations are located. 
 There have been no material changes in the Company s exposure to market risk since December 31, 2023. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
