 and , respectively. and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The Company uses a current expected loss CECL model to estimate the allowance for credit losses on securities held to maturity. The CECL model considers historical loss rates and other qualitative adjustments, as well as a new forward-looking component that considers reasonable and supportable forecasts over the expected life of each security. Management believes the Company will collect all amounts owed on securities held to maturity issued by the U.S. government or a U.S. government-sponsored agency since these securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, and have a long history of no credit losses. Management evaluates all other securities held to maturity using a probability of default method. The probability of default method estimates the probability a security with a certain credit rating will default during its remaining contractual term (probability of default) and how much loss is expected to be incurred if a security defaults (loss give default rate). The Company obtains information from (e.g., Moody s) to estimate the probability of default for each credit rating based on the remaining term of the security and the loss given default rate. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity debt securities totaled and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.

 and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, was excluded from the amortized cost basis of loans. Accrued interest is written off at the same time as when a loan is moved to non-accrual status. Risk characteristics applicable to each segment of the loan portfolio are described as follows. Residential 1-4 Family Real Estate: The residential 1-4 family real estate are generally secured by owner-occupied 1-4 family residences. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income and credit rating of the borrowers. Credit risk in these loans can be impacted by economic conditions within the Company s market areas that might impact either property values or a borrower s personal income. Risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers. Commercial Real Estate: Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger principal amounts, and repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operations of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Credit risk in these loans may be impacted by the creditworthiness of a borrower, property values and the local economies in the Company s market areas. Construction and Land Development Real Estate: Construction and land development real estate loans are usually based upon estimates of costs and estimated value of the completed project and include independent appraisal reviews and a financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Sources of repayment of these loans may include permanent loans, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are considered to be higher risk than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, general economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing. Credit risk in these loans may be impacted by the creditworthiness of a borrower, property values and the local economies in the Company s market areas. Commercial: The commercial portfolio includes loans to commercial customers for use in financing working capital needs, equipment purchases and expansions. The loans in this category are repaid primarily from the cash flow of a borrower s principal business operation. Credit risk in these loans is driven by creditworthiness of a borrower and the economic conditions that impact the cash flow stability from business operations. Consumer: The consumer loan portfolio consists of various term and line of credit loans such as automobile loans and loans for other personal purposes. Repayment for these types of loans will come from a borrower s income sources that are typically independent of the loan purpose. Credit risk is driven by consumer economic factors (such as unemployment and general economic conditions in the Company s market area) and the creditworthiness of a borrower. - Equipment -

 These unrealized losses relate principally to the changes in interest rates and are not due to changes in the financial condition of the issuer, the quality of the underlying assets, or applicable credit enhancements. In analyzing whether and allowance for credit losses on debt securities is required, management considers whether the securities are issued by a government body or agency, whether a rating agency has downgraded the securities, industry analysts reports, the financial condition and performance of the issuer, and the quality of any underlying assets or credit enhancements. Since management has the ability to hold debt securities for the foreseeable future, allowance for credit losses related to debt securities has been recorded at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Management has evaluated the Company s held-to-maturities securities unrealized losses and have concluded that no anticipated credit losses are expected and therefore no reserve for losses related to held-to-maturity securities has been included in the Company s allowance for credit losses.

The model incorporates various assumptions, such as discount rates and prepayment speeds based on market data from independent organizations. Information about the estimated fair value of mortgage servicing rights at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 follows: - - Range of prepayment speed s (1) - - Weighted average default rate 
 Management did not utilize a valuation model to calculate the fair value of mortgage servicing rights at September 30, 2024 but utilized market information to determine fair value.

 borrowed funds. The Company has a master contract agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank that provides for borrowing up to the maximum range of - of the book value of the Bank s qualifying loans based on the pledged loan class and range of - of qualifying investment securities pledged. The FHLB provides both fixed and floating rate advances. Floating rates are based on, but not directly tied to, short-term market rates of interest, such as Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), federal funds, or treasury bill rates. Advances with call provisions permit the FHLB to request payment beginning on the call date and quarterly thereafter. FHLB advances are subject to a prepayment penalty if they are repaid prior to maturity. At September 30, 2024, the Company s available and unused portion of this borrowing agreement totaled approximately million. At December 31, 2023, the Company s available and unused portion of this borrowing agreement totaled approximately million. At September 30, 2024, the Company s available and unused unsecured line of credit with Banker s Bank of Wisconsin totaled million.

Deferred tax assets are deferred tax consequences attributable to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards. After the deferred tax asset has been measured using the applicable enacted tax rate and provisions of the enacted tax law, it is then necessary to assess the need for a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is needed when, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred asset will not be realized. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, available evidence is weighted heavily on cumulative losses, with less weight placed on future projected profitability.

 The Company estimates the fair value of all financial instruments regardless of whether such instruments are measured at fair value. The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company to estimate fair value of financials instruments not previously discussed. Cash and cash equivalents Fair value approximates the carrying value. Loans Fair value of variable rate loans that reprice frequently is based on carrying values. Fair value of other loans is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. Fair value of individually analyzed and other non-performing loans is estimated using discounted expected cash flows or fair value of the underlying collateral, if applicable. FHLB stock Fair value is the redeemable (carrying) value based on the redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank.

During the three and nine months September 30, 2023, there were loans were determined to have credit losses where a specific valuation allowance was needed. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. For assets classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value is described below. Individually Analyzed (Collateral Dependent) The estimated fair value of collateral-dependent individually analyzed loans is based on the appraised fair value of the collateral, less estimated cost to sell. Collateral-dependent individually analyzed loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company considers the appraisal or evaluation as the starting point for determining fair value and then considers other factors and events in the environment that may affect the fair value. Appraisals of the collateral underlying collateral-dependent loans are obtained when the loan is determined to be collateral-dependent and subsequently as deemed necessary by management. Appraisals are reviewed for accuracy and consistency. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management. The appraised values are reduced by discounts to consider lack of marketability and estimated cost to sell if repayment or satisfaction of the loan is dependent on the sale of the collateral. These discounts and estimates are developed by the management by comparison to historical results.

 Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General . Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 792,000, an increase of 70,000, or 9.7 , compared to 722,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest Income . Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.2 million, or 25.5 , from 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase is a result of a 681,000, or 24.9 , increase in loan interest and fees, a 558,000, or 42.9 , increase in interest from investments, and a 23,000, or 3.7 , decrease in interest on cash and cash equivalents.

This increase in yield resulted from the rising interest rate environment. The average balance of held-to-maturity debt securities increased by 2.4 million, or 37.5 , to 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while the average yield on held-to-maturity debt securities increased to 4.48 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.86 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in yield resulted from the rising interest rate environment. Interest Expense .

 deposits. The Company experienced some upward rate pressure in savings and NOW accounts but rates for money market and time deposits have been the most rate sensitive with upward rate adjustment pressure. The average balance of regular savings deposits decreased by 3.5 million, or 10.2 , to 30.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 34.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while the average rate on regular savings deposits decreased from 0.19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and from a correspondent bank. At September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago but had the capacity to borrow 45.8 million. At September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings from the correspondent bank but had the capacity to borrow 4.0 million. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. For further information, see the consolidated statements of cash flows contained in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flows from operations, investing, and financial activities resulted in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 5.8 million. Net cash provided from operating activities amounted to 1.4 million, primarily due to net income of 792,000, 118,000 from net amortization of premiums and discount from available-for-sale debt securities, 122,000 from the decrease in other assets and income tax receivable, and 252,000 from the increase in interest payable and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase in fair value of equity securities of 38,000 and earnings of 75,000 on cash surrender value of life insurance. Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to 2.4 million, primarily due a net increase in certificates of deposit of 5.9 million, partially offset by the net decrease in demand deposits, money markets, NOW and savings accounts of 3.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to 9.6 million, primarily due to purchases of available-for-sale investments of 10.8 million, an increase in loans of 4.5 million, partially offset with proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale investment securities of 5.4 million and maturities of held-to-maturity debt securities of 515,000. We believe we maintain a strong liquidity position and are committed to maintaining it. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. PFS Bancorp, Inc. is a separate legal entity from Peru Federal Savings Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay its operating expenses and other financial obligations. The Company s primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. The amount of dividends that the Bank may declare and pay to the Company is governed by applicable bank regulations. At September 30, 2024, the Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of 7.0 million. At September 30, 2024, the Bank was categorized as well-capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category. For further information, see note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At September 30, 2024, we had 6.4 million of outstanding commitments to originate loans, 731,000 of which represents the balance of remaining funds to be disbursed on construction loans in process, 2.4 million in unused commercial line of credit commitments, 1.2 million of unfunded home equity loans, 50,000 of unfunded consumer line of credit, 1.9 million of commitments to fund new commercial real estate loans, and 100,000 of commitments to fund new closed-end residential real estate loans. At September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature on or before September 30, 2025 totaled 55.4 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed.

 Management of Market Risk General . Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. All directors participate in discussions during the regular board meetings evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, and the level of risk that is appropriate. These discussions take into consideration our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by them. Our asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings. Among the techniques we are using to manage interest rate risk are: maintaining capital levels that exceed the thresholds for well-capitalized status under federal regulations; maintaining a high level of liquidity; growing our core deposit accounts; managing our investment securities portfolio so as to reduce the average maturity and effective life of the portfolio; and continuing to diversify our loan portfolio by adding more commercial real estate loans and commercial loans, which typically have shorter maturities and/or balloon payments. 
 By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases and decreases in market interest rates. We have not engaged in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures or options. We do not anticipate entering into similar transactions in the future. Economic Value of Equity . We compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (economic value of equity or EVE would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases instantaneously by 100, 200, and 300 basis point increments or decreases instantaneously by 100, 200, and 300 basis point increments, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve.

 The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2024 the calculation of the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve. The estimated changes presented in the table are within Board of Director-approved policy guidelines. 

At September 30, 2024 Estimated Increase (Decrease) in EVE as a Percentage of Present EVE Value of Assets (3) Increase Change in Interest Estimated (Decrease) Rates (basis points) (1) EVE (2) Amount Percent EVE Ratio (4) (basis points) (Dollars in thousands) 300 33,868 (12,547) (27.03) 19.70 (421.00) 200 38,483 (7,932) (17.09) 21.45 (246.00) 100 42,761 (3,654) (7.87) 22.91 (100.00) Level 46,415 23.91 (100) 47,237 822 1.77 23.69 (22.00) (200) 47,547 1,132 2.44 23.21 (70.00) (300) 46,208 (207) (0.45) 22.07 (184.00)

 Change in Net Interest Income. The following table sets forth, at September 30, 2024, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income NII that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve. The estimated changes presented in the table are within Board of Director-approved policy guidelines. 

At September 30, 2024 Change in Interest Rates Net Interest Income Year 1 Year 1 Change from (basis points) (1) Forecast Level (Dollars in thousands) 300 5,307 (2.96) 200 5,359 (2.01) 100 5,413 (1.02) Level 5,469 (100) 5,453 (0.29) (200) 5,503 0.62 (300) 5,427 (0.77) 

 (1) Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in EVE and NII require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For instance, the EVE and NII tables presented above assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. However, the shape of the yield curve changes constantly and the value and pricing of our assets and liabilities, including our deposits, may not closely correlate with changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, although the EVE and NII tables may provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time and in the context of a particular yield curve, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on EVE and NII and will differ from actual results. EVE and net interest NII calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The information in Item 2 under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management of Market Risk is incorporated in this Item 3 by reference. Item 4.
