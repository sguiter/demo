million 
of 
U.S.

securities. 
Because 
of 
the

the

portfolio 
is made 
up of 

million 
in 
investment 
grade 
 corporate bonds. The required reserve for these holdings is 
determined each quarter using the model described above. 
For 
 the portion of the HTM exposed to non-government 
credit risk, the Company utilized the PD/LGD 
methodology to estimate 
 a 

thousand ACL as of September 
30, 2024. The book value 
for debt securities classified 
as HTM represents amortized 
 cost less the ACL related to these securities. 
 The 
Company

million 
of 
outstanding 
investment 
securities 
transferred 
from 
the 
AFS 
 portfolio to the HTM portfolio represent unrealized losses since the date of purchase, independent of the impact associated 
 with changes in the cost basis of the securities upon transfer 
between portfolios. 
 When evaluating 
AFS debt 
securities under 
ASC Topic 
326, the 
Company 
has evaluated 
whether the 
decline in 
fair 
 value is attributable 
to credit losses 
or other factors 
like interest rate risk, 
using both quantitative 
and qualitative analyses, 
 including 
company 
performance 
analysis, 
review 
of 
credit 
ratings, 
bond 
vintage, 
remaining 
payment 
terms, 
prepayment 
 speeds and analysis 
of macro-economic conditions. 
Each investment is 
expected to recover 
its price depreciation 
over its 
 holding period 
as it 
moves 
to maturity 
and 
the 
Company 
has the 
intent 
and 
ability 
to hold 
these securities 
to maturity 
if 
 necessary. 
As a result of 
this evaluation, the Company 
concluded that no allowance 
was required on AFS 
securities as of 
 September 30, 2024. 
 At 
September 30, 
2024, 
the 
Company 
had 

million 
of 
unrealized 
losses 
on 
mortgage-backed 
securities 
and 
 collateralized mortgage 
obligations of 
U.S. government 
sponsored entities 
having a 
fair value 
of 

million that 
were 
 attributable to a combination of factors, including relative 
changes in interest rates since the time of purchase. 
 At 
December 31, 
2023, 
the 
Company 
had 

million 
of 
unrealized 
losses 
on 
mortgage-backed 
securities 
and 
 collateralized mortgage 
obligations of 
U.S. government 
sponsored entities 
having a 
fair value 
of 

million that 
were 
 attributable to a combination of factors, including relative 
changes in interest rates since the time of purchase. 
 The contractual 
cash 
flows 
for these 
securities 
are 
guaranteed 
by 
U.S. 
government 
agencies 
and 
U.S. 
government 
 sponsored entities. The municipal bonds are of high credit quality and the declines in fair 
value are not due to credit quality. 
 Based 
on 
the 
assessment 
of 
these 
mitigating 
factors, 
management 
believed 
that 
the 
unrealized 
losses 
on 
these 
debt 
 security holdings are 
a function of 
changes in investment 
spreads and interest 
rate movements 
and not changes 
in credit 
 quality. Management 
expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these 
securities. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company did not intend to 
sell debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position 
and it 
 is more than likely not required to sell these securities 
before recovery of the amortized cost basis. 
 The Bank is a Qualified Public Depository QPD with the State of Florida. As a QPD, the 
Bank has the legal authority 
 to 
maintain 
public 
deposits 
from 
cities, 
municipalities, 
and 
the 
State 
of 
Florida. 
These 
public 
deposits 
are 
secured 
by 
 securities pledged 
to the 
State of 
Florida at 
a ratio 
of 
 
 of 
the outstanding 
uninsured deposits 
at September 30, 
2024 
 and 
 
 at December 31, 2023. The Bank 
must also maintain a minimum amount of pledged 
securities to be in the public 
 funds program. 
 As 
of 
September 30, 
2024, 
the 
Bank 
had 
a 
total 
of 

million 
in 
deposits 
under 
the 
public 
funds 
program 
and 
 pledged to the State of Florida for these public funds were 

bonds with an aggregate fair value of 

million. 
 As of 
December 31, 2023, the 
Bank had 
a total 
of 

million in 
deposits under the

 to the State of Florida for these public funds were 

bonds with an aggregate fair value of

 The Board 
of Governors 
of the Federal 
Reserve System, 
on March 
12, 2023, 
announced the 
creation of 
a new 
Bank 
 Term 
Funding Program BTFP ). The BTFP offered loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit 
 unions, 
and 
other 
eligible 
depository 
institutions 
pledging 
U.S. 
Treasuries, 
U.S. 
agency 
debt 
and 
mortgage-backed 
 securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. The 
BTFP program ceased making new loans as of March 
2024.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 In 
general, 
the 
Company 
utilizes 
the 
Discounted 
Cash 
Flow DCF 
method 
or 
the 
Remaining 
Life WARM 
 methodology to 
estimate the 
quantitative portion 
of the 
ACL for 
loan pools. 
The DCF 
method uses 
a loss 
driver analysis 
 LDA and discounted cash flow analyses. Management engaged 
advisors and consultants with expertise in CECL model 
 development to 
assist in 
development of 
a LDA 
based on 
regression models 
and supportable 
forecast. Peer 
group data 
 obtained 
from 
FFIEC 
Call

is 
used to 
inform

to 
quantify

projective 
models. 
Economic 
forecasts 
applied 
to

models 
to 
estimate 
probability 
of 
 default for loan receivables use at least 
one of the following economic indicators: civilian unemployment rate (national), real 
 gross domestic 
product growth 
(national GDP) 
or the 
House Price 
Index HPI ). 
For each 
of the 
segments 
in which 
the 
 WARM methodology is used, 
the long-term average 
loss rate is 
calculated and applied 
on a quarterly 
basis for the 
remaining 
 life of the pool. Adjustments for economic expectations are 
made through qualitative factors. 
 Qualitative factors Q-Factors used in the ACL methodology 
include: 

Changes in lending policies, procedures, and strategies 

Changes in international, national, regional, and local conditions 

Changes in nature and volume of portfolio 

Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans 
and other similar conditions 

Concentration risk 

Changes in the value of underlying collateral 

The effect of other external factors: e.g., competition, 
legal, and regulatory requirements 

Changes in lending management, among others

 Our ACL 
included residential 
loans. To 
assess the 
potential impact 
of changes 
in qualitative 
factors related 
to these 
 loans, 
management 
performed 
a sensitivity 
analysis. 
The Company 
evaluated 
the 
impact 
of the 
HPI 
used 
in calculating 
 expected losses on the residential loan segment. As of September 30, 2024, for every 100 basis points increase in the HPI 
 index, the forecast reduces 
reserves by approximately 

thousand and about 

basis point to 
the reserve coverage ratio, 
 everything else being 
constant. This 
sensitivity analysis provides 
a hypothetical result 
to assess the 
sensitivity of the 
ACL 
 and does not represent a change in management s 
judgement. 

 As of 
September 30, 2024, 
we stress 
tested two 
qualitative factors 
in our commercial 
real estate 
loan pool, 
as its 
the 
 largest segment 
in our 
portfolio. We 
evaluated the 
impact of 
a change 
in the 
qualitative factors 
from no 
risk to 
maximum 
 loss to 
measure the 
sensitivity of 
the qualitative 
factors. The 
change from 
no risk 
to high 
risk resulted 
in a 

million or 
 
 increase in ACL. This sensitivity analysis provides a 
hypothetical result to assess the sensitivity of 
the ACL and does 
 not represent a change in management s judgement.

 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers 
whether it is more likely than not that some 
 portion or 
all of 
the deferred 
tax assets 
will not 
be realized. 
The ultimate 
realization 
of deferred 
tax assets 
is dependent 
 upon the generation of 
future taxable income 
during the periods 
in which those temporary 
differences become deductible. 
 Management considers the scheduled reversal 
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable 
income, and tax planning 
 strategies in making this assessment. 
 The major tax 
jurisdictions where the 
Company files income 
tax returns are 
the U.S. federal 
jurisdiction and 
the State 
 of Florida. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state income tax return examinations

Additionally,

 Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Fair Value 
Hedge 
 During the quarter

the Company unwound 

fair value interest rate 
swaps with a 
notional 
 aggregate amount 
of 

million. The 
decision to 
unwind these 
swaps was 
driven by 
changes in 
interest rate 
forecasts 
 and asset-liability management strategies. The early 
termination fee to unwind the 
fair value swaps totaled 

million. The 
 termination fees 
allocated to 
each loan 
category will

over the 
remining life 
of the 
hedge loans 
on a

loan. The amortization of 
 the termination fee

shares of Class A 
common stock at a 
price of 

per share. The Bank 
received total net proceeds 
of 
 
 million after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses. 
 In December 2021, 
the Company acquired 
all the issued 
and outstanding shares 
of the Class 
A common stock 
of the 
 Bank, which at the time were 
the only issued and outstanding shares 
of the Bank s capital stock, 
in a share exchange (the 
 Reorganization 
effected 
under 
the 
Florida 
Business 
Corporation 
Act. 
Each 
outstanding 
share 
of 
the 
Bank s 
Class 
A 
 common stock, 
par value 

per share, 
formerly held 
by its 
shareholders 
was 
converted into 
and exchanged 
for 
 
 newly 
issued 
share 
of 
the 
Company s 
Class 
A 
common 
stock, 
par 
value 

per 
share, 
and 
the 
Bank 
became 
the 
 Company s wholly owned subsidiary. 

 In the 
Reorganization, 
each 
shareholder 
of the 
Bank 
received securities 
of 
the same 
class, 
having 
substantially 
the 
 same designations, 
rights, 
powers, preferences, 
qualifications, 
limitations 
and restrictions, 
as those 
that the 
shareholder 
 held in the Bank, 
and the Company s 
then current shareholders 
owned the same 
percentages of the 
Company s common 
 stock as they previously owned of the Bank s common 
stock.

shares of Class A common stock to employees as restricted 
 stock awards 
pursuant to 
the Company s 
2015 equity 
incentive plan 
. 
During 
the first 
quarter 2023, 
the Company 
issued 

shares of Class A 
common stock to 
employees and directors as 
restricted stock awards pursuant 
to the Company s 
 2015 equity incentive plan. 

 As previously announced,

2024, the 
Board of Directors 
approved a 
new share repurchase 
program of up 
 to 

shares of 
Class A 
common stock 
or approximately 
 
 of 
the Company s 
issued and 
outstanding shares 
of 
 common 
stock. 
Under 
the 
repurchase 
program,

Company 
may

shares 
of 
Class 
A 
common 
stock 
on 
a 
 discretionary basis from time

market repurchases, privately negotiated 
transactions, or other means. 
 The 
repurchase 
program 
has 
no 
expiration 
date 
and 
may 
be 
modified, 
suspended, 
or 
terminated 
at 
any 
time. 
The 
new 
 repurchase program 
will commence 
upon completion 
of the Company s 
current repurchase 
program. Repurchases 
under 
 this new program will be funded from the Company s 
existing cash and cash equivalents or future cash flow. 
 During the 
three 
months ended 
September 30, 
2024, the 
Company 
repurchased 

shares 
of Class 
A common 
 stock 
at 
a 
weighted 
average 
price 
per 
share 
of 

. 
The 
aggregate 
purchase 
price 
for 
these 
transactions 
was 
 approximately 

thousand, 
including 
transaction 
costs. 
These 
repurchases 
were 
made 
pursuant 
to 
the 
Company s 
 publicly announced repurchase programs. As of September 30, 2024, 

shares remained authorized for repurchase 
 under the Company s 
two stock repurchase 
programs. During 
the nine months 
ended September 30, 
2023, the Company 
 repurchased 

shares 
of 
Class A common 
stock 
at 
a 
weighted 
average 
price 
per 
share

aggregate 
 purchase price for these transactions was approximately 

million, including transaction costs. 
 In 
addition, 
the 
Company 
will 
provide 
prior 
notification 
to 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
prior 
to 
effecting 
proposed 
share 
 repurchases in new share repurchase programs. 
 Shares of the Company s Class A common stock issued and outstanding as 
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 
 2023 were

 See Note 
11, Subsequent Events, for 
information regarding issuance 
of Class 
A common 
stock to 
employees 
in October 
 2024. 
 Dividends 
 Declaration of dividends 
by the Board 
is required before 
dividend payments 
are made. The 
Company is 
limited in the 
 amount of 
cash dividends 
that it 
may pay. 
Payment of 
dividends is 
generally limited 
to the 
Company s 
net income 
of the 
 current 
year 
combined 
with 
the 
Company s 
retained 
income 
for 
the 
preceding 
two 
years, 
as 
defined 
by 
state 
banking 
 regulations. However, 
for any 
dividend declaration, 
the Company 
must consider 
additional factors 
such as 
the amount 
of 
 current period net income, liquidity, 
asset quality, 
capital adequacy and economic conditions 
at the Bank since the Bank is 
 the primary source 
of funds to fund 
dividends by the Company. 
It is likely that 
these factors would 
further limit the 
amount 
 of dividends which 
the Company could 
declare. In addition, 
bank regulators have 
the authority to 
prohibit banks and 
bank 
 holding companies from paying dividends if they deem 
such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. 
 As of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Company 
was 
not 
subject 
to any 
formal 
supervisory 
restrictions 
on 
its 
ability 
to pay 
 dividends 
but 
will 
notify 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Bank 
of 
Atlanta 
in 
advance 
of 
any 
proposed 
dividend 
to 
the 
Company's 
 shareholders in 
light of 
the Bank's 
negative retained 
earnings. In 
addition, under 
applicable FDIC 
regulations and 
policy, 
 because the 
Bank has 
negative 
retained 
earnings, 
it 
must obtain 
the 
prior approval 
of the 
FDIC before 
effecting 
a cash 
 dividend or other capital distribution. 
 On January 29, 2024, the 
Company announced that its Board of 
Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend program. 
 The quarterly dividend for 
the first quarter of 
2024 was 

per share of Class 
A common stock, paid 
on March 5, 2024, 
 to stockholders 
of record as 
of the close 
of business 
on February 15, 
2024. The 
aggregate distribution 
in connection 
with 
 the first 
quarter dividend 
was 

million. The 
quarterly dividend 
for the 
second quarter 
was 

per share 
of Class 
A 
 common stock, paid on June 
5, 2024, to stockholders of 
record as of the 
close of business on May 15, 
2024. The aggregate 
 distribution on connection with 
the second quarter dividend 
was 

million. The quarterly dividend 
for the third quarter 
was 

per share of Class 
A common stock, paid on 
September 5, 2024, to 
stockholders of record as of 
the close of business 
 on August 15, 2024. The aggregate distribution on connection with 
the second quarter dividend was 

million.

in this Form 10-Q . To prepare financial statements in conformity with 
 US GAAP, 
management makes estimates, assumptions, 
and judgments based on available information. 
These estimates, 
 assumptions, 
and 
judgments 
affect 
the 
amounts 
reported 
in 
the 
financial 
statements 
and 
accompanying 
notes. 
These 
 estimates, assumptions, 
and judgments are 
based on information 
available as of the 
date of the financial 
statements and, 
 as 
this 
information 
changes, 
actual 
results 
could 
differ 
from 
the 
estimates, 
assumptions 
and 
judgments 
reflected 
in 
the 
 financial statements. In 
particular, 
management has identified 
accounting policies that, 
due to the 
estimates, assumptions 
 and 
judgments 
inherent 
in 
those 
policies, 
are 
critical 
to 
an 
understanding 
of 
our 
financial 
statements. 
Management 
has 
 presented the application of these policies to the Audit 
and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. 

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This Form 10-Q 
includes financial information determined by 
methods other than in 
accordance with generally accepted 
 accounting principles GAAP ). This financial information 
includes certain operating performance measures. 
Management 
 has included these non-GAAP measures because it believes these 
measures may provide useful supplemental information 
 for evaluating the Company s underlying performance trends. Further, management uses these measures in 
managing and 
 evaluating 
the 
Company s 
business 
and 
intends 
to 
refer 
to 
them 
in 
discussions 
about 
our 
operations 
and 
performance. 
 Operating performance measures 
should be viewed in 
addition to, and not 
as an alternative to 
or substitute for, 
measures 
 determined in accordance with GAAP, 
and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP measures that may 
be presented 
 by other companies. To the extent applicable, reconciliations of these 
non-GAAP measures to the most 
directly comparable 
 GAAP 
measures 
can 
be 
found 
in 
the 
section 
 Reconciliation 
and 
Management 
Explanation 
of 
Non-GAAP 
Financial 
 Measures included in this Form 10-Q.
 Segment Reporting 
 Management monitors the revenue streams for all its various 
products and services. The identifiable segments are not 
 material 
and 
operations 
are 
managed 
and 
financial 
performance 
is 
evaluated 
on 
an 
overall 
Company-wide 
basis. 
 Accordingly, all 
the financial service 
operations are 
considered by management 
to be 
aggregated in one 
reportable operating 
 segment.

 The Company s 
results 
of 
operations 
depend 
substantially 
on 
the 
levels 
of 
our 
net 
interest 
income 
and 
non-interest 
 income. Other factors contributing 
to the results of 
operations include our provision for 
credit losses, the level 
of non-interest 
 expense, and the provision for income taxes. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 
three months ended September 30, 2023 

 Net income 
increased to 
 6.9 million 
for the 
three months 
ended September 30, 
2024
 from 3.8 
million for 
the same 
 period in 2023. The 3.1 million or 82 increase in net income was attributable to higher interest income from a larger loan 
 portfolio, 
net interest 
margin expansion, 
and 
increased activity 
in fee 
generating 
transactions 
(wire fees, 
gain on 
sale 
of 
 loans, SWAP fees, and treasury management 
fees) between periods. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 
nine months ended September 30, 2023 

 Net income increased to 1 
7.8 million for the nine 
months ended September 30, 
2024
 from 13.8 million for the 
same 
 period in 
2023. The 3.9 
million or 
28.5 increase 
in net 
income was 
attributable to 
higher interest 
income from 
a larger 
 loan portfolio and increased activity in fee generating transactions (wire fees, 
SWAP fees, and treasury management 
fees) 
 between periods. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income 
is the difference 
between interest 
earned on interest-earning 
assets and interest 
paid on interest-
 bearing liabilities 
and is 
the primary 
driver of 
core earnings. 
Interest income 
is generated 
from interest 
and dividends 
on 
 interest-earning 
assets, 
including 
loans, 
investment 
securities 
and 
other 
short-term 
investments. 
Interest 
expense 
is 
 incurred 
from 
interest 
paid 
on 
interest-bearing 
liabilities, 
including 
interest-bearing 
deposits, 
FHLB 
advances 
and 
other 
 borrowings. 
 To evaluate net 
interest income, we 
measure and monitor 
(i) yields on 
loans and other 
interest-earning assets, (ii) 
the 
 costs of deposits 
and other funding 
sources, (iii) net 
interest spread, and 
(iv) net interest margin. 
Net interest spread is 
equal 
 to the difference between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest 
 margin is 
equal to 
the annualized 
net interest 
income 
divided by 
average interest 
-earning assets. 
Because 
non-interest-
 bearing sources 
of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and 
stockholders equity, also fund interest-earning assets, 
 net interest margin includes the indirect benefit of these 
non-interest-bearing funding sources. 
 Changes 
in 
market 
interest 
rates 
and 
interest 
rates 
we 
earn 
on 
interest-earning 
assets 
or 
pay 
on 
interest-bearing 
 liabilities, as well 
as the volume 
and types of 
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing 
and non-interest-bearing liabilities, 
 are usually the 
largest drivers 
of periodic changes 
in net interest 
spread, net interest 
margin and net 
interest income. 
Our 
 asset liability committee ALCO has 
in place asset-liability 
management techniques 
to manage major 
factors that 
affect 
 net interest income and net interest margin.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months 
ended September 30, 2023 

 Net interest income before the provision 
for credit losses was 18.1 
million for the three months 
ended September 30, 
 2024, an 
increase 
of 4.1 
million or 
29.1 , 
from 
 14.0 
million for 
the same 
period in 
2023. This 
increase 
was 
primarily 
 attributable to higher income from a larger loan portfolio combined 
with an increase in the weighted average loan yield 
. 

 Net interest margin was 3.03 
for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2.60 
for the same period in 2023. The 
 volume of 
and rates 
on loans 
and interest-bearing 
liabilities both 
increased; however, 
the volume 
of and 
yields on 
loans 
 grew at a higher rate, offsetting the increase in deposits 
and borrowing costs. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months 
ended September 30, 2023 

 Net interest income 
before the provision 
for credit losses 
was 50.6 million 
for the nine 
months ended September 
30, 
 2024, an 
increase 
of 6.4 
million or 
14.5 , 
from 
 44.2 
million for 
the same 
period in 
2023. This 
increase 
was 
primarily 
 attributable to higher income from a larger loan portfolio combined 
with an increase in the weighted average loan yield. 

Net interest margin was 2.87 for the nine 
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.84 
for the same period in 2023. 
 Loan yields 
and the 
rate paid 
on interest 
-bearing 
liabilities both 
increased; however 
, 
the interest 
-earning 
assets balance 
 was greater than that of interest-bearing liabilities. Therefore 
the effect of the increase in yields 
resulted in a NIM expansion 
 of 3 bps between periods.

Q3 2024 Form 10-Q 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision 
for credit 
losses represents 
a charge 
to earnings 
necessary to 
maintain an 
allowance for 
credit losses 
 that, in 
management's evaluation, 
is adequate 
to provide 
coverage for 
all expected 
credit losses. 
The provision 
for credit 
 losses is impacted 
by variations in 
the size and 
composition of our 
loan and debt 
securities portfolio, recent 
historical and 
 projected future economic conditions, our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan and debt 
securities portfolios 
 and net charge-offs. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months 
ended September 30, 2023 

 The provision 
for credit 
loss was 
 931 thousand 
for the 
three months 
ended September 30, 
2024 compared 
to 653 
 thousand for 
the same 
period in 
2023. Growth 
in the 
loan portfolio 
was the 
primary driver 
of the increase 
in the provision 
 expense during the three months ended September 30, 
2024. 

 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months 
ended September 30, 2023 

 The 
provision 
for 
credit 
loss 
was 
 2.1 
million 
for 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
September 30, 
2024 
compared 
to 
 892 
 thousand for 
the same 
period in 
2023. Growth 
in the 
loan portfolio 
was the 
primary driver 
of the increase 
in the provision 
 expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Non-Interest Income 
 Our services and products generate service charges and fees, mainly from our depository 
accounts. We also generate 
 income from gain on sale of loans though our swap and SBA 
programs. In addition, we own and are beneficiaries of the life 
 insurance policies on some of our 
employees and generate income from 
the increase in the cash surrender 
value of these 
 policies.

income for the dates indicated (in thousands):

 1.3 million 
or 59.1 to 
 3.4 million, 
 compared

primarily 
driven 
by 
growth

reported 
under 
 service fees category, 
partially offset by declines in gains on sale of loans and 
other non-interest income. 

 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months 
ended September 30, 2023 

 Non-interest income for the nine months ended September 
30, 2024 increased 3.0 million or 50.0 , compared 
to the 
 same period in 2023. This increase was 
primarily driven by growth in SWAP loan 
fees reported under service fees category 
 and gain on sale of loans, , partially offset by declines in gains 
on sale of loans and other non-interest income.

 Provision for Income Tax 
 Fluctuations in the effective tax rate reflect the effect of the differences in the inclusion or deductibility of certain income 
 and expenses for 
income tax purposes. 
Therefore, future 
decisions on the 
investments we choose 
will affect our 
effective 
 tax rate. 
The cash 
surrender value 
of bank-owned 
life insurance 
policies covering 
key employees, 
purchasing municipal 
 bonds, and overall levels of taxable income will be important 
elements in determining our effective tax rate.

 Investment Securities 
 The investment portfolio 
is used and 
managed to provide 
liquidity through cash 
flows, marketability 
and, if necessary, 
 collateral for 
borrowings. The 
investment portfolio 
is also 
used as 
a tool 
to manage 
interest rate 
risk and 
the Company s 
 capital 
market 
risk 
exposure. 
The 
philosophy 
of 
the 
portfolio 
is 
to 
maximize 
the 
Company s 
profitability 
taking 
into 
 consideration the Company s 
risk appetite and 
tolerance, manage 
the asset composition 
and diversification, 
and maintain 
 adequate risk-based capital ratios. 
 The investment portfolio 
is managed in accordance 
with the Board approved 
Asset and Liability 
Management ALM 
 policy, 
which 
includes 
investment 
guidelines. 
Such 
policy 
is 
reviewed 
at 
least 
annually 
or 
more 
frequently 
if 
deemed 
 necessary, 
depending on 
market conditions 
and/or unexpected 
events. The investment 
portfolio composition 
is subject to 
 change depending on the funding and liquidity needs of the Company, and the interest risk management objective directed 
 by 
the 
Asset-Liability 
Committee ALCO ). 
The 
portfolio 
of 
investments 
also 
can 
be 
used 
to 
modify 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
 balance 
sheet. 
The 
allocation 
of 
cash 
into 
securities 
takes 
into 
consideration 
anticipated 
future 
cash 
flows 
(uses 
and 
 sources) and all available sources of credit. 
 Our investment portfolio consists 
primarily of securities issued 
by U.S. government-sponsored agencies, 
U.S. 
agency 
 mortgage-backed securities, 
collateralized mortgage 
obligation securities, 
corporate securities, 
other debt 
securities, and 
 municipal securities all 
with varying contractual 
maturities and coupons. 
Due to 
the optionality embedded 
in these securities, 
 the final maturities do not 
necessarily represent the expected 
life of the portfolio. Some 
of these securities will 
be called or 
 paid down prior 
to maturity depending 
on capital market 
conditions and expectations. 
The investment portfolio 
is regularly 
 reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer, 
Treasurer, 
and the ALCO of the Company to ensure an appropriate risk and return 
 profile as well as for adherence to the investment policy. 
 When evaluating AFS 
debt securities under 
ASC Topic 
326, the Company 
evaluates 
whether the decline 
in fair value 
 is attributable 
to credit losses 
or other 
factors like interest 
rate risk, 
using both quantitative 
and qualitative 
analyses, including 
 company performance analysis, review of credit ratings, vintage bonds, remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds and 
 analysis of macro-economic conditions. Each investment is expected to recover its unrealized loss position over its holding 
 period as it approaches 
to maturity and the Company has the intent and ability to hold these securities maturity. 
As a result 
 of this evaluation, the Company concluded that no allowance 
was required on AFS securities as of September 
30, 2024. 
 At 
quarter 
end, 
HTM 
securities 
included 
 157.7 
million 
of 
U.S. 
Government 
and 
U.S. 
Agency 
issued 
bonds 
and 
 mortgage-backed 
securities. 
Because 
of 
the 
explicit 
and/or 
implicit 
guarantee 
on 
these 
bonds, 
the 
Company 
holds 
no 
 reserves 
on these 
holdings. 
The remaining 
portion of 
the HTM 
portfolio 
is made 
up of 
 9.3 
million 
in investment 
grade 
 corporate bonds. The required reserve for these holdings is 
determined each quarter using the model described above. For 
 the portion of the HTM exposed to non-government 
credit risk, the Company utilized the PD/LGD 
methodology to estimate 
 a 8 thousand allowance 
for credit losses ACL 
as of September 30, 
2024. The book value 
for debt securities 
classified 
 as HTM represents amortized cost less ACL. 
 AFS and 
HTM investment 
securities increased 
 22.2 million, or 
7.3 annualized, 
to 426.5 million 
at September 30, 
 2024 from 404.3 million at December 31, 
2023. Investment securities increased due 
to reinvestment of payments received 
 and investment of excess 
in cash balances into 
high credit quality investments 
to increase the Company s 
profitability and 
 modify the 
Company s balance sheet 
duration according to 
the ALM policy. As 
of September 30, 2024, 
investment securities 
 with a 
market value 
of 69.7 million 
were pledged 
to secure 
public deposits. 
The investment 
portfolio does 
not have 
any 
 tax-exempt securities.

 Loans 
 Loans are the 
largest category of 
interest-earning assets 
on the unaudited 
Consolidated Balance 
Sheets, and usually 
 provide higher yields than the 
remainder of the interest 
-earning assets. Higher yields 
typically carry greater 
inherent credit 
 and liquidity risks in comparison to lower yield assets. The Company manages and mitigates such risks in accordance with 
 the credit and ALM policies, risk tolerance and balance 
sheet composition.

The residential 
real estate 
loan segment 
had the 
most significant 
 growth. 

 Our 
loan 
portfolio 
continues 
to 
grow, 
with 
commercial 
real 
estate 
lending 
as 
the 
primary 
focus 
which 
represented 
 approximately 56.8 
of the 
total gross 
loan portfolio 
as of 
September 30, 2024. 
Our loan 
growth strategy 
since inception 
 has been reflective of the market in which we operate and 
of our strategic plan as approved by the Board. 
 Most of the 
commercial real estate 
exposure represents 
loans to commercial 
businesses secured 
by owner-occupied 
 real estate. 
The growth 
experienced in 
recent years 
is primarily 
due to 
implementation of 
our relationship-based 
banking 
 model and 
the success 
of our 
relationship managers 
in competing 
for new 
business 
in a 
highly competitive 
metropolitan 
 area. Many 
of our 
larger loan 
clients have 
long-term relationships 
with members 
of our 
senior management 
team or 
our 
 relationship managers that date back to former institutions. 

 From a 
liquidity perspective, 
our loan 
portfolio provides 
us with 
additional 
liquidity due 
to repayments 
or unexpected 
 prepayments.

 The information 
presented 
in the 
table above 
is based 
upon the 
contractual 
maturities of 
the individual 
loans, which 
 may be 
subject to 
renewal at 
their contractual 
maturity. 
Renewals will 
depend on 
approval by 
our credit 
department and 
 balance sheet 
composition at the 
time of 
the analysis, 
as well 
as any 
modification of terms 
at the 
loan s maturity. Additionally, 
 maturity 
concentrations, 
loan 
duration, 
prepayment 
speeds 
and 
other 
interest 
rate 
sensitivity 
measures 
are 
discussed, 
 reviewed, and analyzed by the ALCO. Decisions on term 
/rate modifications are discussed as well. 

 As of September 30, 
2024, approximately 56 
of the loans have 
adjustable/variable rates and 
44 of the 
loans have 
 fixed rates. The adjustable/variable 
rate loans re-price 
to different benchmarks 
and tenors and 
in different periods 
of time. 
 By contractual characteristics, 
there are no material concentrations 
on anniversary repricing. Additionally, 
it is important to 
 note that 
most of 
our loans have 
interest rate floors. 
This embedded option 
protects the Company 
from a decrease 
in interest 
 rates below the floor and positions us to gain in the scenario 
of higher interest rates.

 Asset Quality 

 Our asset quality grading 
analysis estimates the capability of 
the borrower to repay 
the contractual obligation of 
the loan 
 agreement as scheduled or at all. The Company s internal credit risk grading system is based on experiences with similarly 
 graded loans. Internal credit 
risk grades are reviewed 
at least once a 
year, and 
more frequently as 
needed. Internal credit 
 risk ratings 
may change 
based on 
management s 
assessment of 
the results 
from the 
annual review, 
portfolio monitoring, 
 and other developments observed with borrowers. 

 The internal credit risk grades used by the Company to 
assess the credit worthiness of a loan are shown below: 
 Pass 
 Loans indicate different levels of satisfactory 
financial condition and performance. 

 Special Mention
 
 Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness 
that deserves management s 
 close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses 
may result in deterioration of the repayment 
 prospects for the loan or of the institution s 
credit position at some future date. 

 Substandard 
 Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected 
by the current net worth and paying 
 capacity of the obligator or of the collateral pledged, if 
any. Loans so classified 
have a well-defined weakness or 
 weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. 
They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the 
 institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are 
not corrected. 

 Doubtful
 
 Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent 
in those classified at substandard, with 
 the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection 
or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing 
 facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

 Loss 
 Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible.

 Non-performing 
assets 
include 
all 
loans 
categorized 
as 
non-accrual, 
other 
real 
estate 
owned OREO 
and 
other 
 repossessed assets. Problem loans for 
which the collection or 
liquidation in full is 
reasonably uncertain are placed on 
a non-
 accrual status. This determination is based on current existing facts concerning collateral values and the paying capacity of 
 the 
borrower. 
When 
the 
collection 
of 
the 
full 
contractual 
balance 
is 
unlikely, 
the 
loan 
is 
placed 
on 
non-accrual 
to 
avoid 
 overstating the Company s income for a loan with 
increased credit risk. 

 If the 
principal or 
interest on 
a commercial 
loan becomes 
due and 
unpaid for 
90 days 
or more, 
the loan 
is placed 
on 
 non-accrual status as of 
the date it becomes 
90 days past due 
and remains in non-accrual 
status until it meets 
the criteria 
 for restoration to accrual status. 
Residential loans, on 
the other hand, are placed 
on non-accrual status when 
the principal 
 or interest 
becomes due 
and unpaid 
for 120 
days or 
more and remains 
in non-accrual 
status until 
it meets 
the criteria 
for 
 restoration 
to 
accrual 
status. 
Restoring 
a 
loan 
to 
accrual 
status 
is 
possible 
when 
the 
borrower 
resumes 
payment 
of 
all 
 principal and interest payments for a period of six consecutive months and the Company 
has a documented expectation of 
 repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest or the loan becomes secured and in the process of collection. 
 The 
Company 
may 
grant 
a 
loan 
concession 
to 
a 
borrower 
experiencing 
financial 
difficulties. 
This 
determination 
is 
 performed 
during 
the 
annual 
review 
process 
or 
whenever 
problems 
surface 
regarding 
the 
borrower s 
ability 
to 
repay 
in 
 accordance with 
the original 
terms of 
the loan 
or line 
of credit. 
The concessions 
are given 
to the 
debtor in 
various forms, 
 including interest rate 
reductions, principal forgiveness, extension 
of maturity date, 
waiver, or deferral of 
payments and other 
 concessions intended to minimize potential losses. 
 For further discussion of 
non-performing loans and 
borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties, see 
Note 3 Loans to 
 the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 
1 of Part 1 this Form 10-Q. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The ACL 
represents 
an amount 
that, 
in 
management's 
evaluation, 
is adequate 
to provide 
coverage 
for 
all 
expected 
 future 
credit 
losses 
on 
outstanding 
loans. 
Additionally, 
qualitative 
adjustments 
are 
made 
to 
the 
ACL 
when, 
based 
on 
 management s judgment, there 
are factors impacting 
the allowance estimate 
not considered by 
the quantitative calculations.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We engage 
in various financial 
transactions in 
our operations 
that, under GAAP, 
may not be 
included on 
the balance 
 sheet. To 
meet the financing needs of our customers, 
we may include commitments to extend credit and standby 
letters of 
 credit. To 
a varying 
degree, such 
commitments involve 
elements of 
credit, market, 
and interest 
rate risk 
in excess 
of the 
 amount recognized 
in the 
balance sheet. 
We use 
more conservative 
credit and 
collateral policies 
in making 
these credit 
 commitments than 
we do 
for on-balance 
sheet items. 
We are 
not aware 
of any accounting 
loss to 
be incurred 
by funding 
 these commitments; 
however, 
we 
maintain 
an 
allowance 
for 
off-balance 
sheet 
credit 
risk 
which 
is recorded 
under 
other 
 liabilities on the unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Since commitments associated with letters of 
credit and commitments to extend 
credit may expire unused, the 
amounts 
 shown 
do 
not 
necessarily 
reflect 
actual 
future 
cash 
funding 
requirements.

 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend funds to a client, as long as there is no violation of any condition 
 established 
in 
the 
contract, 
for 
a 
specific 
purpose. 
Commitments 
generally 
have 
variable 
interest 
rates, 
fixed 
expiration 
 dates or 
other 
termination 
clauses 
and 
may require 
payment 
of 
a fee. 
Since many 
of the 
commitments 
are 
expected to 
 expire without being 
fully drawn, the 
total commitment 
amounts disclosed 
above do not 
necessarily represent 
future cash 
 requirements. 
 Unfunded lines of credit represent unused portions of credit facilities to our current borrowers that represent no change 
 in credit risk in our portfolio. Lines 
of credit generally have variable interest 
rates. The maximum potential amount 
of future 
 payments we could 
be required to 
make is represented 
by the contractual 
amount of the 
commitment, less 
the amount of 
 any advances made. 
 Letters of credit are 
conditional commitments issued 
by us to guarantee 
the performance of a 
client to a third 
party. 
In 
 the event of nonperformance by 
the client in accordance with the 
terms of the agreement with the 
third party, 
we would be 
 required to fund 
the commitment. 
If the commitment 
is funded, we 
would be entitled 
to seek recovery 
from the client

 Asset and Liability Management Committee 
 Members 
of 
senior 
management 
and 
our 
Board 
make 
up 
the 
asset 
and 
liability 
management 
committee, 
or 
ALCO. 
 Senior management 
is responsible 
for ensuring 
that Board 
approved strategies 
and policies 
for managing 
and mitigating 
 risks are appropriately executed within the designated lines of 
authority and responsibility in a timely manner. 
 ALCO 
oversees 
the 
establishment, 
approval, 
implementation, 
and 
review 
of 
interest 
rate 
risk, 
management, 
and 
 mitigation strategies, ALM related policies, ALCO procedures 
and risk tolerances and appetite. 
 While some degree of Interest Rate Risk IRR is inherent to the banking business, we believe our ALCO implements 
 sound risk management practices to identify, 
quantify, 
monitor, and limit IRR exposures. 
 When assessing 
the scope 
of IRR 
exposure 
and 
impact on 
the consolidated 
balance sheet, 
cash 
flows and 
income 
 statement, 
management 
considers 
both 
earnings 
and 
economic 
impacts. 
Asset 
price 
variations, 
deposit 
volatility 
and 
 reduced earnings or outright losses could adversely affect 
the Company s liquidity, 
performance, and capital adequacy. 
 Income simulations 
are used 
to assess 
the impact 
of changing 
rates on 
earnings under 
different rates 
scenarios and 
 time horizons. 
These simulations 
utilize both 
instantaneous and 
parallel changes 
in the 
level of 
interest rates, 
as well 
as 
 non-parallel changes such as 
changing slopes (flat and steepening) 
and twists of the yield curve. 
Static simulation models 
 are based 
on current 
exposures 
and assume 
a constant 
balance sheet 
with 
no 
new growth. 
Dynamic 
simulation 
is also 
 utilized to have a 
more comprehensive assessment 
on IRR. This simulation 
relies on detailed 
assumptions outlined in 
our 
 budget and strategic plan, and in assumptions regarding changes in 
existing lines of business, new business, management 
 strategies and client expected behavior. 
 To 
have 
a 
more 
complete 
picture 
of 
IRR, 
the 
Company 
also 
evaluates 
the 
economic 
value 
of 
equity EVE ). 
This 
 assessment 
allows 
us 
to 
measure 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
the 
economic 
values 
will 
change 
under 
different 
interest 
rate 
 scenarios (parallel and non-parallel). The economic value approach focuses on a longer-term time horizon and captures all 
 future cash flows expected 
from existing assets and 
liabilities. The economic value 
model utilizes a static 
approach in that 
 the analysis 
does not 
incorporate new 
business; rather, 
the analysis 
shows a 
snapshot in 
time of 
the risk 
inherent in 
the 
 balance sheet. 
 Market and Interest Rate Risk Management 
 According to 
our ALCO 
model, as 
of September 
30, 2024, 
we had 
a neutral 
to slightly 
asset sensitive 
balance sheet 
 both for 
year one 
and year 
two modeling, 
using the 
static modeling. 
Asset sensitivity 
indicates 
that our 
assets generally 
 reprice 
faster 
than 
our 
liabilities, 
which 
results 
in 
a 
favorable 
impact 
to 
net 
interest 
income 
when 
market 
interest 
rates 
 increase. Liability sensitivity indicates that our liabilities generally reprice faster 
than our assets, which results in a 
favorable 
 impact to net interest 
income when market interest 
rates decrease. Many assumptions 
are used to calculate 
the impact of 
 interest rate variations on our net interest income, such as asset prepayment speeds, 
non-maturity deposit price sensitivity 
 (betas), pricing correlations, deposit truncations and decay 
rates, and key interest rate drivers. 
 Because of the inherent use 
of these estimates and 
assumptions in the model, 
our actual results may, 
and most likely 
 will, differ from static measures results. 
In addition, static measures like EVE 
do not include actions that management 
may 
 undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates or customer deposit behavior. As part of 
 our ALM strategy and policy, management 
has the ability to modify the balance sheet to either increase asset duration and 
 decrease liability 
duration to reduce 
asset sensitivity, 
or to decrease 
asset duration and 
increase liability duration 
in order 
 to increase asset sensitivity. 
 According to our model, as of September 30, 2024, our balance sheet is neutral to slightly asset sensitive for both year 
 one and 
year two 
under interest 
static rate 
scenarios (an 
increase or 
decrease of 
400 basis 
points). This 
means that 
the 
 impact of rates variations will be minimal 
to our NIM. Additionally, 
utilizing an EVE approach, we analyze 
the risk to capital 
 from 
the 
effects 
of 
various 
interest 
rate 
scenarios 
through 
a 
long-term 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
model. 
This 
measures 
the 
 difference 
between 
the 
economic 
value 
of 
our 
assets 
and 
the 
economic 
value 
of 
our 
liabilities, 
which 
is 
a 
proxy 
for 
our 
 liquidation value. 
According to 
our balance 
sheet composition, 
and as 
expected, our 
model stipulates 
that an 
increase in 
 interest rates will have a 
negative impact on the EVE and 
lower rates, a positive impact. 
Results and analysis are presented 
 quarterly to the ALCO, and strategies are reviewed and defined.

 Liquidity 
 Liquidity is defined 
as a Company s 
capacity to meet 
its cash and 
collateral obligations at 
a reasonable cost. 
Maintaining 
 an adequate level of liquidity depends on the Company s ability to 
efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flow 
 and collateral needs without adversely affecting 
either daily operations or the financial condition of the 
Company. 
 Liquidity risk 
is the 
risk that 
we will 
be unable 
to meet 
our short-term 
and long-term 
obligations as 
they become 
due 
 because of an inability 
to liquidate assets or 
obtain relatively adequate funding. The 
Company s obligations, and the funding 
 sources 
used 
to 
meet 
them, 
depend 
significantly 
on 
our 
business 
mix, 
balance 
sheet 
structure 
and 
composition, 
credit 
 quality of our assets and the cash flow profiles of our on 
- 
and off-balance sheet obligations. 
 In managing 
inflows and 
outflows, 
management 
regularly 
monitors situations 
that can 
give rise 
to increased 
liquidity 
 risk. These 
include funding 
mismatches, market 
constraints on 
the ability 
to convert 
assets (particularly 
investments) into 
 cash or in accessing sources of funds (i.e., market liquidity), 
pledging of assets and contingent liquidity events. 
 Changes in macroeconomic conditions, as well as exposure 
to credit, market, operational, legal and reputational 
risks, 
 such as 
cybersecurity risk, 
could have 
an unexpected 
impact on 
the Company s 
liquidity risk 
profile and 
are factored 
into 
 the assessment of liquidity and the ALM framework. 
 Management has established 
a comprehensive and 
holistic management process for 
identifying, measuring, monitoring 
 and 
mitigating 
liquidity 
risk. 
Due 
to 
its 
critical 
importance 
to 
the 
viability 
of 
the 
Company, 
liquidity 
risk 
management 
is 
 integrated into our risk management processes, Contingency 
Funding Plan and ALM policy. 
 Critical elements of our liquidity 
risk management include: effective corporate governance consisting of 
oversight by the 
 Board and active 
involvement of senior 
management; appropriate strategies, policies, 
procedures, and limits 
used to identify 
 and mitigate liquidity risk; comprehensive liquidity risk measurement and 
monitoring systems (including assessments of the 
 current and prospective cash flows or sources and uses of funds) that are commensurate with the complexity and 
business 
 activities of 
the Company; 
active management 
of intraday 
liquidity and 
collateral; an 
appropriately diverse 
mix of 
existing 
 and 
potential 
future 
funding 
sources; 
adequate 
levels 
of 
highly 
liquid 
marketable 
securities 
free 
of 
legal, 
regulatory, 
or 
 operational 
impediments, 
that 
can 
be 
used 
to 
meet 
liquidity 
needs 
in 
stressful 
situations; 
comprehensive 
contingency 
 funding plans 
that sufficiently address 
potential adverse liquidity 
events and emergency 
cash flow 
requirements; and internal 
 controls 
and 
internal 
audit 
processes 
sufficient 
to 
determine 
the 
adequacy 
of 
the 
institution s 
liquidity 
risk 
management 
 process. 
 We 
expect 
funds 
to 
be 
available 
from 
several 
basic 
banking 
activity 
sources, 
including 
the 
core 
deposit 
base, 
the 
 repayment and maturity of 
loans and investment security cash 
flows. Other potential funding 
sources include Federal Funds 
 purchased, 
brokered 
certificates 
of 
deposit, 
listing 
services 
certificates 
of 
deposit, 
and 
draws 
from 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
 Bank 
of 
Atlanta 
discount 
window, 
and 
borrowings 
from 
the 
FHLB. 
Accordingly, 
we 
believe 
our 
liquidity 
resources 
are 
 adequate to fund loans and meet other cash needs as 
necessary.

 Impact of Inflation 
 Our 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
and 
related 
notes 
have 
been 
prepared 
in 
accordance 
with 
U.S. 
GAAP, 
 which require the measurement of financial 
position and operating results in terms 
of historical dollars, without considering 
 the changes in the 
relative purchasing power 
of money over time 
due to inflation. The 
impact of inflation is 
reflected in the 
 increased cost of operations. 
Unlike most industrial companies, 
nearly all our assets and 
liabilities are monetary in 
nature. 
 As a result, 
interest rates have a 
greater impact on our 
performance than do the 
effects of general levels 
of inflation. Periods 
 of high inflation 
are often accompanied 
by relatively higher 
interest rates, and 
periods of low 
inflation are accompanied 
by 
 relatively lower interest rates.

 Management 
has 
included 
these

measures 
because 
it 
believes 
these 
measures 
may 
provide 
useful 
 supplemental information 
for evaluating 
the Company s 
underlying performance 
trends. Further, 
management uses 
these 
 measures 
in

evaluating 
the 
Company s 
business 
and 
intends 
to 
refer 
to 
them 
in

 Item 3. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, 
we are not required to provide the information required 
by this item.
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the 
supervision and with 
the participation of 
our management, including 
our President and 
Chief Executive Officer 
 and our 
Chief Financial 
Officer, 
we evaluated 
the effectiveness 
of the 
design and 
operation of 
the Company s 
disclosure 
 controls and 
procedures (as 
defined in 
Rules 13a-15(e) 
and 15d-15(e) 
under the 
Securities Exchange 
Act of 
1934) as 
of 
 September 30, 2024. Based on 
that evaluation, management believes that, 
as of the end 
of the period covered 
by this Form 
 10-Q, the 
Company's disclosure 
controls and 
procedures were 
effective 
to collect, 
process, and 
disclose the 
information 
 required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted 
under the Exchange Act within the required time periods. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been 
no change in 
our internal control 
over financial reporting 
(as defined in 
Rules 13a-15(f) and 
15d-15(f) 
 under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Form 10-Q that has 
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to 
 materially affect, our internal control over financial 
reporting. 

 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In 
designing 
and 
evaluating 
the 
disclosure 
controls 
and 
procedures, 
management 
recognizes 
that 
any 
controls 
and 
 procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving 
 the desired control objectives. 
In addition, the design 
of disclosure controls and 
procedures must reflect the 
fact that there 
 are resource constraints and that management is required to apply 
judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls 
 and procedures relative to their costs.

 PART II 
 
 Item 1. 
Legal Proceedings 
 The 
Company 
previously 
disclosed 
that 
litigation 
(the 
 Litigation 
had 
been 
commenced 
on 
July 
13, 
2023 
by 
three 
 individuals 
who 
were 
shareholders 
of 
the 
Bank 
prior 
to 
the 
Bank s 
reorganization 
into 
the 
holding 
company 
form 
of 
 organization in 2021 
(the Plaintiffs 
against six 
persons, all 
of whom were 
directors of 
the Bank at 
the relevant 
time (the 
 Defendants ), in the Circuit Court, Eleventh Judicial Circuit for Miami-Dade County, Florida (the Court (Benes et al. v. de 
 la 
Aguilera 
et 
al.) 
alleging 
the 
Defendants 
(i) caused 
the 
Bank, 
as 
directors 
thereof, 
to 
engage 
in ultra 
vires 
conduct by 
 devising 
and 
approving 
the 
exchange 
transaction 
effected 
in 
July 
2021 
pursuant 
to 
which 
the 
Bank s 
then 
outstanding 
 shares of Class C and Class D preferred stock was exchanged for shares of Class A voting common stock in the 
Bank (the 
 Exchange Transaction ), 
which action 
the Plaintiffs 
allege was 
not permitted 
by the 
Bank s Articles 
of Incorporation, 
and 
 (ii) breached 
their 
fiduciary 
duty as 
directors 
of the 
Bank 
by 
approving 
and 
engaging 
in 
the 
Exchange 
Transaction. 
The 
 Plaintiffs sought the 
Court to certify the 
action as a class 
action and to award 
damages in an 
amount to be 
proven at trial. 
 The Plaintiffs sought damages exceeding 750,000 
plus attorney s fees and costs 
as well as such other relief as the Court 
 determined to award. 

 The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Litigation with 
prejudice (the Motion ). On December 27, 2023, the Court, 
 after reviewing 
the Motion, 
the Plaintiff s response 
thereto and 
the Defendant s reply 
as well 
as the 
oral arguments presented 
 by 
the 
parties 
on 
December 
14, 
2023, 
granted 
the 
Motion, 
dismissing 
the 
Litigation 
with 
prejudice 
and 
rendering 
final 
 judgment in favor 
of the Defendants 
(the Order ). The Court 
reserved jurisdiction to award 
costs or grant 
any post-judgment 
 relief. 
 On May 1, 
2024, the 
Plaintiffs filed 
in the Third 
District Court 
of Appeal for 
the State of 
Florida (the Appellate 
Court 
 an appeal (the Appeal ), 
appealing the issuance 
of the Order and 
seeking a reversal 
of the Order. 
The Plaintiffs claimed 
 the Court erred by 
concluding (i) the Exchange Transaction was not 
ultra vires, and (ii) 
that the Legacy Shareholders (which 
 includes the Plaintiffs) 
lacked direct standing. 
The Plaintiffs 
filed their initial 
brief and the 
Defendants filed 
on July 1, 
2024 
 their answer brief Answer Brief responding 
to the allegations 
contained in the 
Appeal. 
The Plaintiffs 
have the ability 
to 
 file a 
Reply Brief 
responding to 
the Defendant s 
Answer Brief 
but have 
not done 
so as 
of the 
date hereof. 
The Plaintiff s 
 have requested oral argument. 
 The Company believes 
that the positions 
in the Appeal 
are legally 
and factually without 
merit, and it 
intends to vigorously 
 defend 
against 
the 
Appeal, 
pursue 
any 
potential 
counterclaims 
against 
the 
Plaintiffs 
as 
it 
deems 
appropriate, 
and 
seek 
 coverage 
from 
its 
insurance 
carriers. 
However, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
assurance 
that 
the 
Appeal 
will 
be 
resolved 
favorably. 
 Furthermore, there 
is also 
no assurance 
that we 
will be 
able to 
secure coverage 
from our 
insurance carriers 
for any 
expenses 
 incurred by 
us in 
connection with 
defending against 
the Appeal. 
The Appellate 
Court could 
grant the 
Plaintiff s motion 
to 
 reverse the Order and remand the case to the Court. 
 At 
this 
time, 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
management, 
the 
likelihood 
is 
remote 
that 
the 
impact 
of 
such 
proceedings, 
either 
 individually or 
in the 
aggregate, would 
have a 
material adverse 
effect 
on our 
consolidated results 
of operations, 
financial 
 condition 
or cash 
flows. However, 
one 
or more 
unfavorable 
outcomes 
in any 
claim or 
litigation 
against 
us, including 
the 
 aforementioned Appeal 
regarding the 
Exchange Transaction, 
could have 
a material 
adverse effect 
on the period 
in which 
 such claims 
or litigation 
are resolved. 
In addition, 
regardless of 
their merits 
or their 
ultimate outcomes, 
such matters 
are 
 costly, divert management s 
attention and may materially adversely affect our 
reputation, even if resolved in our favor. 
 In addition 
to the 
foregoing, we 
are from 
time to 
time subject 
to claims 
and litigation 
arising in 
the ordinary 
course of 
 business. 
These 
claims 
and 
litigation 
may 
include, 
among 
other 
things, 
allegations 
of 
violation 
of 
banking 
and 
other 
 applicable regulations, competition 
law, labor 
laws and consumer 
protection laws, as 
well as claims or 
litigation relating to 
 intellectual property, 
securities, breach of contract 
and tort. We intend 
to defend ourselves vigorously 
against any pending 
 or future claims and litigation. 
 There can be no 
assurance that any 
future legal proceedings 
to which we are 
a party will not 
be decided adversely 
to 
 our interests and have a material adverse effect 
on our financial condition and operations.
