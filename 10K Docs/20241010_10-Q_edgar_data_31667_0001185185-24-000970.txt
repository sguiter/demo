Significant Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies, other than the adoption of new accounting pronouncements separately documented herein and unless otherwise disclosed, are consistent with those disclosed in Note 1 to our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended February 29, 2024 included in our Form 10-K. 

, the closing of which remains subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions. Upon closing, the proceeds from the sale are expected to pay off the Term Loans and Revolving Loan. Following the loan payoff, management plans to fund ongoing operations with limited borrowings through local banks or other financing sources. In addition, management s plans include reducing inventory which will generate free cashflows and building the active PaperPie Brand Partners to pre-pandemic levels. Although there is no guarantee these plans will be successful, management believes these plans, if achieved, will alleviate the substantial doubt about continuing as a going concern and generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they become due over the next twelve months.

We are also the exclusive United States Multi-Level Marketing MLM distributor of Usborne Publishing Limited Usborne children s books. Significant portions of our product offering, and inventory are concentrated with Usborne. Our distribution agreement with Usborne includes annual minimum purchase volumes along with specific payment terms, which, if not met or if payments are not received in a timely manner, offer Usborne the right to terminate the agreement. During fiscal 2024, the Company did not meet the minimum purchase volumes and certain payments were not received timely. No notification of non-compliance or termination has been received from Usborne. Should termination of the agreement occur, the Company will be allowed, at a minimum, to sell through their remaining Usborne inventory over the twelve months following the termination date. 

We sell our products through two separate divisions, PaperPie and Publishing. These two divisions each have their own customer base. The PaperPie division markets our complete line of products through a network of independent Brand Partners using a combination of home shows, internet party events and book fairs. The Publishing division markets Kane Miller, Learning Wrap-Ups and SmartLab Toys on a wholesale basis to various retail accounts.

Non-Segment Operating Results for the Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 

Total operating expenses not associated with a reporting segment decreased 0.6 million, or 20.7 , to 2.3 million for the three-month period ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 2.9 million for the same quarterly period a year ago. Operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of a 0.4 million decrease in labor from staff reductions across all departments associated with the reduction in revenues, and a 0.2 million decrease in depreciation expense. 

Interest expense decreased 0.2 million, or 28.6 , to 0.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 0.7 million for the same quarterly period a year ago due to paydown on the Company s borrowings, period over period. 

Other income decreased 3.7 million, or 86.0 , to 0.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 4.3 million for the same quarterly period a year ago resulting from the receipt of the Employee Retention Credit totaling 3.8 million and 0.1 million from the gain on the sale of assets, both in the quarter ended August 31, 2023, offset by a 0.2 million increase in rental income in the quarter ended August 31, 2024 from the new tenant in the Hilti Complex. 

Income taxes decreased 1.1 million, or 275.0 , to a tax benefit of 0.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, from a tax expense of 0.4 million for the same quarterly period a year ago, primarily resulting from operating losses in the second quarter ended August 31, 2024. Our effective tax rate stayed the same 26.9 for the quarter ended August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023. Our tax rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 21 due to the inclusion of state income and franchise taxes. 

Non-Segment Operating Results for the Six Months Ended August 31, 2024 

Total operating expenses not associated with a reporting segment decreased 0.8 million, or 13.8 , to 5.0 million for the six-month period ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 5.8 million for the same period a year ago. Labor expenses decreased 0.6 million from staff reductions across all departments and freight handling costs decreased 0.2 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024, both associated with reduced sales. 

Interest expense decreased 0.4 million, or 26.7 , to 1.1 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 1.5 million for the same period a year ago, due to decreased borrowings period over period. 

Other income decreased 3.5 million, or 76.1 , to 1.1 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 4.6 million for the same quarterly period a year ago, primarily from the receipt of the Employee Retention Credit totaling 3.8 million and 0.1 million from the gain on the sale of assets, both in the quarter ended August 31, 2023, offset by a 0.2 million increase in rental income from the new tenant in the Hilti Complex and a 0.1 increase in other income related to a Chik-fil-A promotion. 

Income taxes decreased 1.2 million, or 1200.0 , to a tax benefit of 1.1 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024, from a tax expense of 0.1 million for the same period a year ago, primarily resulting from operating losses for the six months ended August 31, 2024. Our effective tax rate increased to 26.8 for the six months ended August 31, 2024, from 25.1 for the six months ended August 31, 2023 due primarily to sales mix fluctuations between states. Our tax rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 21 due to the inclusion of state income and franchise taxes.

PaperPie Operating Results for the Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 

PaperPie net revenues decreased 3.9 million, or 41.9 , to 5.4 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 9.3 million during the same period a year ago. The average number of active brand partners in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 13,900, a decrease of 4,200, or 23.2 , from 18,100 average active brand partners selling in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company reports the average number of active Brand Partners as a key indicator for this division. We saw new Brand Partner recruiting negatively impacted by the recent change in our distribution agreement with Usborne Publishing Limited. This agreement required the rebranding of the direct sales division from Usborne Books More UBAM to PaperPie. This rebranding was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Subsequent to the rebranding, Brand Partner levels declined due to several reasons including economic factors that include recent record inflation, resulting in high fuel costs and food price increases that continue to impact the disposable income of our customers. The reduced sales resulted in increased Brand Partner turnover and lower levels of new Brand Partner recruits. We expect this impact on sales to continue as inflationary pressures persist through fiscal 2025. 

Net revenues during the fiscal 2025 second quarter were also negatively impacted from increased discounts. Discounts as a percentage of sales before discounts and allowances increased from 32.6 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to 55.3 in the second quarter of this fiscal year, resulting in less net revenues of approximately 2.2 million. The increased discounts resulted from recruiting promotions to increase band partner levels and additional customer discounts offered to spur sales during the quarter. 

Gross margin decreased 3.1 million, or 50.8. , to 3.0 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 6.1 million during the same period a year ago. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues for the three months ended August 31, 2024 decreased to 55.1 , compared to 65.4 the same period a year ago, representing a decrease of 0.6 million. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was primarily attributed to increased discounts between the periods related to recruiting promotions and increased customer discounts. 

PaperPie operating expenses consists of operating and selling expenses, sales commissions and general and administrative expenses. Operating and selling expenses primarily consists of freight expenses and materials and supplies. Sales commissions include amounts paid to Brand Partners for new sales and promotions. These operating expenses are directly tied to the sales volumes of the PaperPie segment. General and administrative expenses include payroll, outside services, inventory reserves and other expenses directly associated with the segment.

Table of Contents 

Total operating expenses decreased 2.2 million, or 38.6 , to 3.5 million during the three-month period ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 5.7 million reported in the same quarter a year ago. Operating and selling expenses decreased 0.4 million, or 25.0 , to 1.2 million during the three-month period ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 1.6 million reported in the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to less freight expense on fewer sales. Sales commissions decreased 1.7 million, or 48.6 , to 1.8 million during the three-month period ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 3.5 million reported in the same quarter a year ago, due to the decrease in net revenues. Sales commissions as a percentage of net revenues decreased from 37.4 to 33.6 between periods, primarily due to the mix of order type. Web orders pay higher commissions than special programs such as book fairs. General and administrative expenses decreased 0.1 million, or 16.7 , to 0.5 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 0.6 million during the same period a year ago, due primarily to 0.1 million of reduced bank fees from fewer credit card transactions associated with reduced sales. 

Operating income (loss) for the PaperPie segment decreased 0.9 million, or 225.0 to an operating loss of (0.5) million during the three months ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 0.4 million reported in the same quarter a year ago. Operating income (loss) for the PaperPie division decreased primarily from reduced sales; along with additional recruiting and product discounts partially offset by reduced operating expenses. 

PaperPie Operating Results for the Six Months Ended August 31, 2024 

PaperPie net revenues decreased 7.6 million, or 34.7 , to 14.3 million during the six-month period ended August 31, 2024, compared to 21.9 million from the same period a year ago. The average number of active brand partners in the six-month period ended August 31, 2024 was 13,700, a decrease of 6,900, or 33.5 , from 20,600 selling in same period a year ago. Recruiting and maintaining brand partners has been negatively impacted by several factors including record inflation, our new distribution agreement with Usborne and the rebranding of the division in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Inflation was most evident in increased food and fuel prices, which impacts the disposable income of our target customer base, which is families with small children. Sales during the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2024 continued to be negatively impacted by continuing inflationary pressures and we expect this to continue through the rest of fiscal year 2025, as these pressures persist. Historically, when we have experienced these difficult inflationary times, our active brand partner numbers have been positively impacted as more families look for non-traditional income streams to offset rising costs of living. 

Gross margin decreased 5.7 million, or 39.3 , to 8.8 million during the six-month period ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 14.5 million during the same period a year ago, due primarily to a decrease in net revenues. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 61.5 for the six-month period ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 66.2 for the same period a year ago. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was primarily attributed to increased recruiting promotions offered to increase brand partner levels and additional discounts offered to customers between the periods to spur sales. 

Total operating expenses decreased 4.0 million, or 32.0 , to 8.5 million during the six-month period ended August 31, 2024, from 12.5 million for the same period a year ago. Operating and selling expenses decreased 0.8 million, or 22.9 , to 2.7 million during the six-month period ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 3.5 million reported in the same period a year ago, primarily due to a decrease in shipping costs associated with the decrease in volume of orders shipped totaling approximately 0.6 million and a 0.2 million decrease in brand partner incentive trip expenses as fewer brand partners are expected to earn the trip this year. Sales commissions decreased 2.7 million, or 35.5 , to 4.9 million during the six-month period ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 7.6 million reported in the same period a year ago, primarily due to the decrease in net revenues. General and administrative expenses decreased 0.4 million, or 28.6 , to 1.0 million, from 1.4 million recognized during the same period last year, due primarily to decreased credit card transaction fees associated with decreased sales volumes totaling 0.2 million and a 0.2 million decrease in payroll expenses. 

Operating income of the PaperPie segment decreased 1.7 million, or 85.0 , to 0.3 million during the six months ended August 31, 2024, when compared to 2.0 million reported in the same period last year. Operating income of the PaperPie division as a percentage of net revenues for the six months ended August 31, 2024 was 2.1 , compared to 9.2 for the six months ended August 31, 2023. Operating income for the PaperPie division decreased primarily from reduced sales; along with additional recruiting promotions and customer discounts offered to increase brand partner levels and spur sales in the current year.

This change was due to a 0.1 million decrease in sales commissions due to decreased overall sales and the restructuring of the Company s internal sales department. 

Operating income of the Publishing segment decreased 0.4 million, or 44.4 , to 0.5 million during the six-month period ended August 31, 2024 when compared to 0.9 million reported in the same period a year ago, due primarily to the decrease in sales and operating expenses. The decrease in operating income was primarily associated with the decline in revenues associated with the stoppage of Usborne product sales in this division. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

EDC has a history of profitability and positive cash flow. We typically fund our operations from the cash we generate. During periods of operating losses, EDC will reduce purchases and sell through inventory to generate cash flow. The Company expects to reduce current excess inventory levels and use the cash proceeds to offset any future operating losses, and to pay down the line of credit and portions of the term debt. Available cash has historically been used to pay down outstanding bank loan balances, for capital expenditures, to pay dividends and to acquire treasury stock. We utilize a bank credit facility and other term loan borrowings to meet our short-term cash needs, as well as fund capital expenditures, when necessary. As of the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2025, our revolving bank credit facility loan balance was 6.1 million with 0.9 million in available capacity. 

During the first six months of fiscal year 2025, we experienced positive cash inflows from operations of 335,500. These cash inflows resulted from: 

net loss of 3,082,400 

Adjusted for: 

depreciation and amortization expense of 972,200 

share-based compensation expense, net of 201,600 

provision for inventory allowance of 191,300 

provision for credit losses of 41,600 

Offset by: 

deferred income taxes of 959,700 

net loss on sale of assets of 3,700 

Positively impacted by: 

decrease in inventories, net of 5,120,400 

increase in income taxes payable of 353,500 

Negatively impacted by: 

decrease in accrued salaries and commissions, and other liabilities of 693,600 

increase in accounts receivable of 183,800 

decrease in accounts payable of 1,287,200 

increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 259,000 

decrease in deferred revenues of 83,100

Cash used in investing activities was 196,000 for capital expenditures, consisting of 200,000 in new software development costs to add new features to our proprietary systems that PaperPie Brand Partners use to monitor their business and place customer orders and offset by 4,000 from the sale of machinery and equipment. 

Cash used in financing activities was 286,500, which was comprised of net borrowings on the line of credit of 600,000 and 13,500 from the sale of treasury stock, offset by payments on term debt of 900,000. 

We continue to expect the cash generated from our operations, specifically from the reduction of excess inventory, and cash available through our line of credit with our Lender will provide us with the liquidity we need to support ongoing operations. Cash generated from operations will be used to purchase inventory in order to expand our product offerings and to pay down existing debt. 

On August 9, 2022, the Company executed a Credit Agreement Loan Agreement with BOKF, NA Bank of Oklahoma or the Lender ). The Loan Agreement established a fixed rate term loan in the principal amount of 15,000,000 (the Fixed Rate Term Loan ), a floating rate term loan in the principal amount of 21,000,000 (the Floating Rate Term Loan together with the Fixed Rate Term Loan, collectively, the Term Loans ), and a revolving promissory note in the principal amount up to 15,000,000 (the Revolving Loan or Line of Credit ). 

On December 22, 2022, the Company executed the First Amendment to our Loan Agreement with the Lender. This amendment clarified the definition of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio to exclude dividends paid prior to November 30, 2022, and placed restrictions on acquisitions and cash dividends. 

On May 10, 2023, the Company executed the Second Amendment to our Loan Agreement with the Lender. This amendment waived the fixed charge ratio default which occurred on February 28, 2023 and amended the financial covenant to not require the fixed charge ratio to be measured at May 31, 2023. The Second Amendment also added a cumulative maximum level of fiscal year to date inventory purchases through the expiration of the Revolving Loan Agreement, increased the borrowing rate on the Company s Revolving Loan to Term SOFR Rate plus 3.5 , required certain swap agreements be executed within 30 days of the amendment, reduced the revolving commitment from 15,000,000 to 14,000,000, effective May 10, 2023, and further reduced the revolving commitment to 13,500,000, effective July 15, 2023, among other items. 

On June 6, 2023, pursuant to its interest rate risk and risk management strategy, the Company entered into a swap transaction (the Swap Transaction with the Lender, which converts a portion of the original 21,000,000 Floating Rate Term Loan from a floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate for the next two years. The Swap Transaction has a notional amount of 18,000,000 through fiscal quarter ending May 31, 2024, and then resets to 13,000,000 through May 30, 2025, while continuing to mirror the amortizing balance of the Floating Rate Term Loan. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company, in effect, has exchanged the floating interest rate of 30-Day Term SOFR Rate at the trade date of June 5, 2023, to a fixed rate of 4.73 . The Swap Transaction commenced on June 7, 2023, with a termination date of May 30, 2025. 

On August 9, 2023, the Company executed the Third Amendment along with a Revised Credit Agreement Revised Loan Agreement with the Lender. This amendment extended the Revolving Loan maturity date to January 31, 2024 and introduced a stepdown to the Revolving Commitment from 13,500,000, through August 30, 2023; to 10,500,000 through October 30, 2023; to 9,000,000 through November 29, 2023; to 5,000,000 through December 30, 2023; to 4,500,000 through January 30, 2024; and to 4,000,000 on January 31, 2024. The amendment restricted the Company from entering into any new purchase orders and uses its best efforts to cancel existing purchase orders. It also required the Company to list its real estate property located at 10302 East 55th Place, Tulsa, Oklahoma, for sale with a licensed commercial real estate broker satisfactory to the Lender on or before August 18, 2023, among other items. Contingent upon the occurrence of an Event of Default in the agreement, the Company shall within 15 days list the Hilti Complex with a licensed commercial real estate broker satisfactory to the Lender. The Third Amendment also increased the borrowing rate on the Revolving Loan to 30-Day Term SOFR Rate + 4.50 . The Revised Loan Agreement was updated for the changes in the Third Amendment as well as removed the fixed charge ratio and the ability for borrowings to be accelerated before the January 31, 2024 Revolving Loan maturity date. 

Prior to the Third Amendment, executed on August 9, 2023, the Loan Agreement contained provisions that required the Company to maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio. The Company was in violation of the minimum fixed charge ratio covenant as of February 28, 2023, for which the Company obtained a written waiver of compliance from the Lender and was not required to measure the fixed charge ratio as of May 31, 2023. Concurrent with the execution of the Third Amendment to the Loan Agreement, the Loan Agreement was modified to incorporate the changes outlined in the Third Amendment and the fixed charge ratio covenant was removed, as well as the Lender s right to accelerate the maturities of the Fixed Rate Term Loan and Floating Rate Term Loan due to the fixed charge ratio covenant.

On November 30, 2023, the Company executed the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement Amendment with the Lender. The Amendment, effective December 1, 2023, increased the Revolving Loan commitment to 8,000,000 and extended the maturity date to May 31, 2024. The Amendment also required the Company to list the Hilti Complex for sale, allowed the Company to execute additional purchase orders, subject to the lender s approval and conditions, not to exceed 2,100,000 between December 1, 2023 and March 31, 2024, among other items. Proceeds from the sale of the property are to be used to pay down the borrowings with the Lender. A third-party appraisal was completed on the Hilti Complex, consisting of the 400,000 square feet building complex on approximately 50 acres, along with approximately 15 acres of adjacent unused land, in July of 2023 with a market value of 41,970,000. 

On June 13, 2024, the Company executed the Fifth Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement with the Lender. The Amendment, effective May 31, 2024, adjusts the maximum availability of the Revolving Loan commitment to 7,000,000 through the maturity date of October 4, 2024. The Amendment also requires an additional decrease in the Revolving Loan to 4,500,000 from the effective date of the sale of the Hilti Complex among other restrictions and requirements. 

Available credit under the current 7,000,000 revolving line of credit with the Company s Lender was approximately 901,900 at August 31, 2024. 

Subsequent to quarter end, the Company executed the Sixth Amendment to the Existing Credit Agreement with the Lender. The Amendment, effective October 3, 2024, extends the maturity date to January 4, 2025 and includes required step downs on the Revolving Loan to 5.5 million by November 30, 2024.

Risks and Uncertainties 

In accordance with ASC 205-40, Going Concern , the Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. 

The short-term duration of the Revolving Loan and uncertainty of the bank s ongoing support beyond January 4, 2025, along with recurring operating losses and other items, raise substantial doubt over the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. To address these concerns, the Company has taken steps in its plans to reduce debt by selling owned real estate. The proceeds from the sale are expected to pay off the Term Loans and Revolving Loan. Following the loan payoff, management plans to fund ongoing operations with limited borrowings through local banks or other financing sources. In addition, management s plans include reducing inventory which will generate free cashflows and building the active PaperPie Brand Partners to pre-pandemic levels. Although there is no guarantee these plans will be successful, management believes these plans, if achieved, will alleviate the substantial doubt about continuing as a going concern and generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they become due over the next twelve months.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States( GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our valuation of inventory, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, allowance for sales returns, long-lived assets and deferred income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 

Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Historically, however, actual results have not differed materially from those determined using required estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this report and in our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended February 29, 2024 included in our Form 10-K. However, we consider the following accounting policies to be more significantly dependent on the use of estimates and assumptions. 

Share-Based Compensation 

We account for share-based compensation whereby share-based payment transactions with employees, such as stock options and restricted stock, are measured at estimated fair value at the date of grant. For awards subject to service conditions, compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. Awards subject to performance conditions are attributed separately for each vesting tranche of the award and are recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for each tranche. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur. Any cash dividends declared after the restricted stock award is issued, but before the vesting period is completed, will be reinvested in Company shares at the opening trading price on the dividend payment date. Shares purchased with cash dividends will also retain the same restrictions until the completion of the original vesting period associated with the awarded shares. 

The restricted share awards under the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2019 LTI Plan and 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2022 LTI Plan contain both service and performance conditions. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense only for the portion of the restricted share awards that are considered probable of vesting. Shares are considered granted, and the service inception date begins, when a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions between the Company and the employees has been established. The fair value of these awards is determined based on the closing price of the shares on the grant date. The probability of restricted share awards granted with future performance conditions is evaluated at each reporting period and compensation expense is adjusted based on the probability assessment. 

During the first six months of fiscal year 2025, the Company recognized 0.2 million of compensation expense associated with the shares granted. 

Revenue Recognition 

Sales associated with product orders are recognized and recorded when products are shipped. Products are shipped FOB-Shipping Point. PaperPie s sales are generally paid at the time the product is ordered. Sales which have been paid for but not shipped are classified as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. Sales associated with consignment inventory are recognized when reported and payment associated with the sale has been remitted. Transportation revenue represents the amount billed to the customer for shipping the product and is recorded when the product is shipped. 

Estimated allowances for sales returns are recorded as sales are recognized. Management uses a moving average calculation to estimate the allowance for sales returns. We are not responsible for a product damaged in transit. Damaged returns are primarily received from the retail customers of our Publishing division. This damage occurs in the stores, not in shipping to the stores, and we typically do not offer credit for damaged returns. It is industry practice to accept non-damaged returns from retail customers. Management has estimated and included a reserve for sales returns of 0.2 million for August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively.

Table of Contents 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

We maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and a reserve for vendor share markdowns, when applicable (collectively credit losses ). An estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts, current customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, customers financial conditions and current economic trends. Management has estimated and included an allowance for credit losses of 0.1 million for both August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024. 

Inventory 

Our inventory contains approximately 2,000 titles, each with different rates of sale depending upon the nature and popularity of the title. Almost all of our product line is saleable as the products are not topical in nature and remain current in content today as well as in the future. Most of our products are printed in China, Europe, Singapore, India, Malaysia and Dubai typically resulting in a four to eight-month lead-time to have a title printed and delivered to us. 

Certain inventory is maintained in a noncurrent classification. Management continually estimates and calculates the amount of noncurrent inventory. Noncurrent inventory arises due to occasional purchases of titles in quantities in excess of what will be sold within the normal operating cycle, due to the minimum order requirements of our suppliers. Noncurrent inventory is estimated by management using an anticipated turnover ratio by title, based primarily on historical trends. Inventory in excess of 2 years of anticipated sales is classified as noncurrent inventory. These inventory quantities have additional exposure for storage damages, aging of topical related content and associated issues, and therefore have higher obsolescence reserves. Noncurrent inventory balances prior to valuation allowances were 15.5 million and 12.3 million as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively. Noncurrent inventory valuation allowances were 0.7 million and 0.6 million as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively. 

Brand Partners that meet certain eligibility requirements may request and receive inventory on consignment. We believe allowing our Brand Partners to have consignment inventory greatly increases their ability to be successful in making effective presentations at home shows, book fairs and other events; in summary, having consignment inventory leads to additional sales opportunities. Approximately 11.3 of our active Brand Partners have maintained consignment inventory at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Consignment inventory is stated at cost, less an estimated reserve for consignment inventory that is not expected to be sold or returned to the Company. The total cost of inventory on consignment with Brand Partners was 1.2 million and 1.4 million at August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively. 

Inventories are presented net of a valuation allowance, which includes reserves for inventory obsolescence and reserves for consigned inventory that is not expected to be sold or returned to the Company. Management estimates the inventory obsolescence allowance for both current and noncurrent inventory, which is based on management s identification of slow-moving inventory. Management has estimated a valuation allowance for both current and noncurrent inventory, including the reserve for consigned inventory, of 1.2 million and 1.0 million at August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer). 

Based on that evaluation, these officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were designed and were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to them, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported in accordance with the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During the second quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report on Form 10-Q, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
