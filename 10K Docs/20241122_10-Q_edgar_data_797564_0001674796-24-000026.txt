 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the condensed financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein. As used in this report, the terms "Company", "we", "our", "us" and "HSTC" refer to HST Global, Inc. 
 Preliminary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which we indicate by words or phrases such as "anticipate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "will," "we believe," "HSTC believes," "management believes" and similar language. The forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of HSTC and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those set forth in the discussion under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this report. The actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. We base the forward-looking statements on information currently available to us, and we assume no obligation to update them. Investors are also advised to refer to the information in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, especially on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, in which we discuss in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. As such, investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks and uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our condensed financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of US GAAP. US GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to U.S. GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our condensed financial statements. 
 Results of Operations The Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The Company had no revenues or costs of sales during 2024 or 2023. The Company realized a net loss of 13,792 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss of 35,730 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss for the 3rd quarter of 2024 is attributable to a reduction in interest expense, consulting expense and the elimination of the debt to Ron Howell. 
 Results of Operations The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The Company had no revenues or costs of sales during 2024 or 2023. The Company realized a net loss of 64,609 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss of 109,311 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is attributable to a reduction in interest expense, consulting expense and the elimination of the debt to Ron Howell.
