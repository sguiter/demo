On August 23, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement among the Company, the domestic subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, the lenders party thereto (the Lenders ), and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders (the Administrative Agent ), pursuant to which the Lenders are providing the Company senior secured credit facilities maturing in August 2027 consisting of a revolving credit facility in the aggregate maximum principal amount of million and a term loan in the original aggregate principal amount of million (collectively, the Credit Facilities ), and the ability to request incremental revolving credit or term loan facilities in an aggregate amount of up to an additional million, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain other conditions. 
 
 Obligations outstanding under the Credit Facilities accrue interest at a variable rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") plus an adjustment between and (depending on the applicable interest period) plus a margin between and (depending on the Company s net leverage ratio). The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facilities was as of September 30, 2024 . During the term of the revolving credit facility, the Company will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility equal to between and (depending on the Company s net leverage ratio). The available balance under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024 , there were outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility. 
 
 Contractual principal payments for the term loan are as follows: remainder of 2024 - million; 2025 - million; 2026 - million and 2027 - million. The term loan does not contain pre-payment penalties. 
 
 The Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all of the operating assets of the Company, and the Company s obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by all of its domestic subsidiaries. The Company s obligations under the Credit Facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, investments, restricted payments (including dividends and related distributions), liquidations, mergers, consolidations or acquisitions, affiliate transactions and sales of assets or subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement also requires the Company to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to 1.0 and a net leverage ratio not to exceed to 1.0. The Company s net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is generally calculated as the ratio of (a) indebtedness minus unrestricted cash to (b) consolidated EBITDA for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company was in compliance with these ratios.

 In our Healthcare Apparel segment, we manufacture (through third parties or in our own facilities) and sell a wide range of healthcare apparel, such as scrubs, lab coats, protective apparel and patient apparel. We sell our brands of healthcare service apparel to healthcare laundries, dealers, distributors, retailers and consumers primarily in the United States. From a long-term perspective, we expect that demand for our signature marketing brands, including Fashion Seal Healthcare and Wink (within CID Resources), will continue to provide opportunities for growth and increased market share. 
 
 Contact Centers 
 
 In our Contact Centers segment (also known as The Office Gurus ), which operates in El Salvador, Belize, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, and the United States, we provide outsourced, nearshore business process outsourcing, contact and call-center support services to North American customers. These services are also provided internally to the Company s other two operating segments. The Office Gurus has become an award-winning business process outsourcer offering inbound and outbound voice, email, text, chat and social media support. The nearshore call-center market has grown as businesses look to reduce operating costs while maintaining high-quality customer support. Nearshore operators are able to provide comparable service to their U.S. counterparts at a fraction of the price. With an environment and career path designed to attract and maintain top talent across all sites, we believe The Office Gurus is positioned well to continue growing this business.

Global Economic and Political Conditions 
 
 Economic and political events over the past several years have altered the landscape in which we and other U.S. companies operate in a variety of ways. World events, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting economic sanctions have impacted the global economy, including by exacerbating inflationary and other pressures. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East could continue to affect oil prices and have other negative effects on the global economy. Civil unrest in countries where we manufacture products, such as Haiti, may result in our facilities incurring damage or destruction that interrupts our manufacturing processes and adversely affects our reputation and our relationships with our customers. While inflation and interest rates decreased in 2024, the effects of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, further fluctuations in inflationary conditions and interest rates, additional sanctions or retaliatory measures related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis or other situations, including deteriorating or prolonged diplomatic tension between the United States and China, could further negatively affect U.S. and international commerce and exacerbate or prolong the period of high energy prices. 
 
 Prolonged or recurring disruptions or instability in the United States and global economies, and how the world reacts to those disruptions or instability, could have long-term impacts on our business. These business impacts could negatively affect us in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, reduced demand for our core products and services, reductions to our revenue and profitability, costs associated with complying with new or amended laws and regulations affecting our business, declines in our stock price, reduced availability and less favorable terms of future borrowings, valuation of our pension obligations, reduced credit-worthiness of our customers, and potential impairment of the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Net Income

The increase in net income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in net sales and gross margins at our Branded Products and Healthcare Apparel segments, a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses across all three of our reportable segments. 
 
 EBITDA 
 
 EBITDA was 11.7 million and 9.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The gross margin rate increased as compared to the prior year period primarily due to costs of goods favorability associated with our Haiti manufacturing facility during the current period. 
 
 Gross margin rate for our Contact Centers segment was 54.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 55.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The rate decrease was primarily due to increased employee related costs of our agents.

 As a percentage of net sales, total selling and administrative expenses was 34.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 34.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The rate increase was primarily driven by increases in employee related costs, third-party professional services and expenditures related to marketing and advertising activities. 
 
 As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses for our Branded Products segment was 26.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 28.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense decreased to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.5 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to a 36.2 million decrease in our weighted average outstanding borrowings along with a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on those borrowings from 7.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Income tax expense increased to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Income tax expense and the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was primarily impacted by the variability in the mix of earnings across the Company s foreign and domestic operations, subject to various statutory tax rates in those jurisdictions. The effective tax rate may vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete, unusual or non-recurring items, the resolution of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, the tax impact from employee share-based payments, or other items.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview Management uses a number of standards in measuring the Company s liquidity, such as: working capital, profitability ratios, cash flows from operating activities, and activity ratios. The Company s balance sheet generally provides the ability to pursue acquisitions, invest in new product lines and technologies and invest in additional working capital as necessary. 
 
 The Company s primary source of liquidity has been its net income and the use of credit facilities and term loans as described further below. In the future, the Company may continue to use credit facilities and other secured and unsecured borrowings as a source of liquidity. The Company may also begin relying on the issuance of equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that any such financings would be available to us on reasonable terms. Any future issuances of equity securities or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities may be dilutive to our shareholders. Additionally, the cost of the Company s future sources of liquidity may differ from the costs of the Company s sources of liquidity to date. 
 
 Working Capital Needs 
 
 We utilize working capital to fund the operations of our business and have certain related contractual obligations, including commitments under site leases and other non-cancelable contracts. 
 
 One of our largest cash requirements is for the purchase of inventory. Superior carries inventories of both raw materials and finished products, the practice of which requires substantial working capital, which we believe to be common in the industry. 
 
 Material Short-Term Plans for Cash 
 
 For the next twelve months, our primary capital requirements are to maintain our operations, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and for other general corporate purposes. Management currently believes that the combination of our current cash level, cash flows provided by operating activities and availability under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy the above requirements for the next twelve months. 
 
 Material Long-Term Plans for Cash 
 
 Beyond the next twelve months, our principal demand for funds will be for maintenance of our core business, to satisfy long term contractual obligations and the continuation of the Company s ongoing capital expenditure program designed to improve the effectiveness and capabilities of our facilities and technology. The Company at all times evaluates its capital expenditure program in light of prevailing economic conditions. The Company s material contractual obligations include outstanding debt, operating leases, long-term pension liability and non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities in Other Liabilities. Management currently believes that the combination of our current cash level, cash flows provided by operating activities and availability under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy the above requirements.

Operating Activities. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to cash outflows for inventories, contract assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by an increase in net income. Working capital cash changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily included decreases of 16.0 million in inventories, 7.9 million in contract assets, 6.4 million in accounts payable and other current liabilities, 5.8 million in accounts receivable and 4.8 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by an increase of 4.7 million in net income.

 On August 9, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan. Under the plan, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 10 million of its common stock over a period of one year ending in August 2025. This plan replaces the May 2, 2019 plan, as amended, which authorized the repurchase of up to 750,000 shares. 92,549 shares had been repurchased under the May 2, 2019 plan as of August 9, 2024. No further shares will be repurchased under that plan. The new stock repurchase plan allows the Company to purchase common stock from time to time through, among other ways, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, subject to applicable securities laws and other legal requirements and relevant factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of any purchases will depend upon a number of factors, including the price and availability of the Company s stock and general market conditions. The stock repurchase plan may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time, without prior notice. Shares repurchased may be reissued later in connection with employee benefit plans and other general corporate purposes. Shares purchased under the common stock repurchase plan are constructively retired and returned to unissued status. See Part II-Other Information, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

 EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income excluding interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company believes EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the Company s core operating results from period to period by removing (i) the impact of the Company s capital structure (interest expense from outstanding debt), (ii) tax consequences and (iii) asset base (depreciation and amortization). The Company uses EBITDA internally to monitor operating results and to evaluate the performance of its business. In addition, the compensation committee has used EBITDA in evaluating certain components of executive compensation, including performance-based annual incentive programs. 
 
 EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded to calculate EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company s results of operations. The presentation of the Company s EBITDA may change from time to time, including as a result of changed business conditions, new accounting pronouncements or otherwise. If the presentation changes, the Company undertakes to disclose any change between periods and the reasons underlying that change. The Company s EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner. 
 
 The following table reconciles net income to EBITDA (in thousands):

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements 
 
 Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by use of the words may, will, should, could, expect, "anticipate, estimate, believe, intend, project, potential, or plan or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include, without limitation: (1) projections of revenue, income, and other items relating to our financial position and results of operations, including short term and long term plans for cash, (2) statements of our plans, objectives, strategies, goals and intentions, (3) statements regarding the capabilities, capacities, market position and expected development of our business operations and (4) statements of expected industry and general economic trends. 
 
 Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may materially adversely affect the anticipated results. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the impact of competition; uncertainties related to supply disruptions, inflationary environment (including with respect to the cost of finished goods and raw materials and shipping costs), employment levels (including labor shortages) and general economic and political conditions in the areas of the world in which the Company operates or from which it sources its supplies or the areas of the United States of America U.S. or United States in which the Company s customers are located; changes in the healthcare, retail chain, food service, transportation and other industries where uniforms and service apparel are worn; our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, discover liabilities associated with such businesses during the diligence process, successfully integrate any acquired businesses, or successfully manage our expanding operations; the price and availability of raw materials; attracting and retaining senior management and key personnel; the effect of the Company s previously disclosed material weakness in internal control over financial reporting; the Company s ability to successfully remediate its material weakness in internal control over financial reporting and to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting ; and other factors described in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those described in the Risk Factors section herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 . Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements made herein and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements made herein are only made as of the date of this Form 10-Q and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as may be required by law. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitati ve and Qualitative Disclosures a bout Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our debt. Interest on our Credit Facilities is based upon the secured overnight financing rate SOFR ). As SOFR is a relatively new reference rate with a limited history, there may or may not be more volatility than with other reference rates such as LIBOR, which may result in increased borrowing costs for the Company. A hypothetical increase in the SOFR of 100 basis points as of January 1, 2024 would have resulted in approximately 0.7 million in additional pre-tax interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For further information regarding our debt instruments, see Note 3 to the Financial Statements. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 
 Sales to customers outside of the United States are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may negatively impact gross margin realized on our sales. Less than 5 of our sales contracts are denominated in foreign currencies. We cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. In certain cases, we may enter into foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with our sales and expenses denominated in foreign currency. There can be no assurance that our strategies will adequately protect our operating results from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations.

Table of Contents 

Financial results of our foreign subsidiaries in the Branded Products segment are denominated in their local currencies, which include the Hong Kong dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the British pound, the Indian rupee, the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and the Canadian dollar. These operations may also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in their functional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income. Excluding intercompany payables and receivables considered to be long-term investments, changes in exchange rates for assets and liabilities not denominated in their functional currency are reported as foreign currency transaction gains (losses) within selling and administrative expenses in our statements of comprehensive income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, foreign currency losses were not significant. We also have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk from the translation of foreign subsidiaries from the local currency into the U.S. dollar. Comprehensive income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included a foreign currency translation adjustment loss of 1.2 million and a foreign currency translation adjustment gain of 0.2 million, respectively. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer, Michael Benstock, and the Company s principal financial officer, Michael Koempel, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date ). Based on such evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting described below and as previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. 
 
 A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, management identified a material weakness relating to segregation of duties, change management and user access within certain proprietary information technology systems of the Contact Centers segment. The Company determined that management s review controls over these areas are not designed effectively to detect a material misstatement related to the completeness, accuracy, and presentation of the financial statements. This material weakness continues to exist as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Notwithstanding the identified material weakness, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have determined, based on the procedures we have performed, that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at September 30, 2024 and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Ongoing Remediation Efforts with Respect to the Material Weakness 
 
 The Company s management, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, has taken the following actions to remediate the material weakness relating to certain proprietary information technology systems of the Contact Centers segment identified as of December 31, 2022: (i) deployed enhanced change management software and reassessed approval authority levels in order to better manage access and program changes within our proprietary system; (ii) implemented processes and controls to better identify and manage segregation of duties; and (iii) designed and implemented additional enhanced review and monitoring controls. 
 
 While the Company was able to test the design effectiveness of the enhanced controls, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the enhanced controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the related controls are effective. Therefore, the material weakness continued to exist as of September 30, 2024. The Company will monitor the effectiveness of its remediation plan and will refine its remediation plan as appropriate. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except as discussed above under Ongoing Remediation Efforts with Respect to the Material Weakness, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are a party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 We are exposed to certain risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described in Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our manufacturing facilities and warehouses in Haiti are at risk of damage or disruptions from civil unrest and other occurrences. 
 
 Our Healthcare Apparel segment relies on our manufacturing facilities and warehouses in Haiti for the manufacturing and storage of finished goods. Our manufacturing facilities and warehouses may be damaged or our ability to use or access them may be disrupted as a result of civil unrest or other occurrences in Haiti. Such events may interfere with our manufacturing processes, information systems, telecommunication services, and product delivery for sustained periods and may also may make it difficult or impossible for employees to reach our business locations. Damage or destruction that interrupts our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our reputation, our relationships with our customers, our leadership team s ability to administer and supervise our business, and cause us to incur substantial additional expenditures to repair or replace damaged equipment or facilities or commence alternate production locations. While we currently have commercial liability insurance, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Prolonged disruption of our manufacturing processes in Haiti also may entitle some of our customers to amend or terminate their contracts with us. Worsening conditions in Haiti may also result in the displacement of native Haitians looking for refuge in neighboring Dominican Republic which may result in the closure of roads and port access which may limit or restrict our normal and recurring business in Haiti. Any of the above factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
