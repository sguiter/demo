ASC 320 further requires that held-to-maturity securities be re ported at amortized cost and available-for-sale securities be reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of the effect of income taxes, until they are sold. At the time of sale, any gains or losses, calculated by the specific identification method, will be recognized as a component of operating results and any amounts previously included in stockholders equity, which were recorded net of the income tax effect, will be reversed.

million at September 30, 2024, or of the total loan portfolio, compared to million , or , at December 31, 2023. The Company may modify the contractual cash flow of loans in situations where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties. The Company strives to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to modify their loans to more affordable terms before they reach nonaccrual status. These modified terms may include interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness, term extensions, payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss to the Company and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. For modifications where the Company forgives principal, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off. Modified loans are considered nonperforming loans. Loan collateral in process of foreclosure primarily includes taxi medallion loans that have reached 120 days past due and have been charged down to their net realizable value, in add ition to consumer repossessed collateral in the process of being sold. For New York City taxi medallion loans in the process of foreclosure, the Company continued to utilize a net value of when assessing net realizable value for these taxi medallion loans, despite fluctuating current transfer prices which may exceed that level from time to time . The "loan collateral in the process of foreclosure" designation reflects that the collection activities on these loans have transitioned from working with the borrower to the liquidation of the collateral securing the loans. The Company accounts for its sales of loans in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, or FASB ASC 860, which provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. In accordance with FASB ASC 860, the Company had elected the fair value measurement method for its servicing assets and liabilities. The principal portion of loans serviced for others by the Company and its affiliates was million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company has evaluated the servicing aspect of its business in accordance with FASB ASC 860 and determined that no material servicing asset or liability existed as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible pursuant to ASC 740. The Company considers the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company s evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets must consider both positive and negative evidence. The weight given to the potential effects of positive and negative evidence is based on the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Based upon these considerations, the Company determined the necessary valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024. The Company has filed tax returns in many states. Federal, New York State, New York City, and Utah State tax filings of the Company for the tax years 2020 through the present are the more significant filings that are open for examination.

The recreation lending segment is a consumer finance business that works with third-party dealers and financial service providers for the purpose of financing RVs, boats, collector cars, and other consumer recreational equipment, of which RVs, boats, and collector cars make up , , and of the segment portfolio, with no other product lines equal to or exceeding , as of September 30, 2024. The highest concentrations of recreation loans are in Texas and Florida at and of loans outstanding and with no other states at or above as of September 30, 2024. The home improvement lending segment works with contractors and financial service providers to finance residential home improvement with the largest product lines being roofs, swimming pools, and windows at , , and of total home improvement loans outstanding, and with no other product lines exceeding as of September 30, 2024. The highest concentrations of home improvement loans are in Texas and Florida both at of loans outstanding and with no other states at or above as of September 30, 2024. The commercial lending segment focuses on serving a wide variety of industries, with concentrations in manufacturing, construction, and wholesale trade making up , , and of the loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024, with no other product lines exceeding as of September 30, 2024. The commercial lending segment invests across the United States with concentrations in California, Wisconsin, and Texas each having , , and of the segment portfolio, and no other states having a concentration at or greater than as of September 30, 2024. The taxi medallion lending segment arose in connection with the financing of taxi medallions, taxis, and related assets, primarily all of which are located in the New York City metropolitan area as of September 30, 2024. The Company's corporate and other investments segment is a non-operating segment that includes items not allocated to the Company's operating segments such as investment securities, equity investments, intercompany eliminations, and other corporate elements. As part of segment reporting, capital ratios for all operating segments have been normalized as a percentage of consolidated total equity divided by total assets, with the net adjustment applied to corporate and other investments. In addition, the commercial segment primarily represents the mezzanine lending business, with certain legacy commercial loans (immaterial to total) allocated to corporate and other investments.

, with future minimum payments under these agreements of approximately million. (B) OTHER COMMITMENTS As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had other commitments. Generally, any commitments would be on the same terms as loans to or investments in existing borrowers or investees, and generally have fixed expiration dates. Since some commitments would be expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. (C) SEC LITIGATION On December 29, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its President and Chief Operating Officer alleging certain violations of the anti-fraud, books and records, internal controls and anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws. The litigation relates to certain issues that occurred during the period 2015 to 2017, including (i) the Company s retention of third parties in 2015 and 2016 concerning posting information about the Company on certain financial websites and (ii) the Company s financial reporting and disclosures concerning certain assets, including Medallion Bank, in 2016 and 2017, a period when the Company had previously reported as a business development company (BDC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Since April 2018, the Company does not report as a BDC, and has not worked with such third parties since 2016. The Company does not expect to change previously reported financial results. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on March 22, 2022, the SEC filed an amended complaint on April 26, 2022 and the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on August 5, 2022. On September 18, 2024, the Court largely denied the Company s motion to dismiss, other than one claim that was dismissed. The deadline for the Company to file its answer to the amended complaint is November 15, 2024. The SEC is seeking injunctive relief, disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest and civil penalties in amounts unspecified, as well as an officer and director bar against the Company s President and Chief Operating Officer. The Company and its President and Chief Operating Officer intend to defend themselves vigorously and believe that the SEC will not prevail on its claims. Nevertheless, depending on the outcome of the litigation, the Company could incur a loss and other penalties that could be material to the Company, its results of operations and/or financial condition, as well as a bar against its President and Chief Operating Officer. In addition, the Company has and expects to further incur significant legal fees and expenses in defending against such charges by the SEC and the Company may be subject to shareholder litigation relating to these SEC matters.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. This section is intended to provide management s perspective of our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, this section contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Certain factors that could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements are described in the Risk Factors section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 COMPANY BACKGROUND 
 We are a specialty finance company whose focus and growth has been our consumer finance and commercial lending businesses operated by Medallion Bank, or the Bank, and Medallion Capital, Inc., or Medallion Capital. The Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary that originates consumer loans for the purchase of recreational vehicles, boats, collector cars, and home improvements, and provides loan origination and other services to fintech partners. Medallion Capital is a wholly-owned subsidiary that originates commercial loans through its mezzanine financing business. As of September 30, 2024, our consumer loans represented 95 of our gross loan portfolio, and commercial loans represented 4 . Total assets were 2.9 billion and 2.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Our loan-related earnings depend primarily on our level of net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the total yield on our loan portfolio and the cost of borrowed funds. We fund our operations through a wide variety of interest-bearing sources, including bank certificates of deposit issued to consumers, debentures issued to and guaranteed by the SBA, privately placed notes, trust preferred securities, and Federal Reserve discount window and other borrowing arrangements. Net interest income fluctuates with changes in the yield on our loan portfolios and changes in the cost of borrowed funds, as well as changes in the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities held by us. Net interest income is also affected by economic, regulatory, and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand, and the availability of funding to finance our lending activities. We, like other financial institutions, are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest-earning assets reprice, either due to inflation or other factors, on a different basis than our interest-bearing liabilities. We continue to monitor global supply chain disruptions, gas prices, labor shortages, unemployment, as well as other factors which contribute to competition and changes in the demand for our loan products. We have taken, and are taking further, steps in light of a potential economic downturn and the current inflationary environment to moderate the pace of our growth. 
 We also provide debt, mezzanine, and equity investment capital to companies in a variety of commercial industries. These investments may be venture capital style investments which may not be fully collateralized. Our investments are typically in the form of secured debt instruments with fixed interest rates accompanied by an equity stake or warrants to purchase an equity interest for a nominal exercise price (such warrants are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets). Interest income is earned on the debt instruments. 
 The Bank is an industrial bank regulated by the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions that originates consumer loans, raises deposits, and conducts other banking activities. The Bank generally provides us with our lowest cost of funds which it raises through bank certificates of deposit. To take advantage of this low cost of funds, historically we referred a portion of our taxi medallion and commercial loans to the Bank, which originated these loans, and have since been serviced by Medallion Servicing Corp., or MSC. However, other than in connection with dispositions of existing taxi medallion and related assets, the Bank has not originated any new taxi medallion loans since 2014 (and Medallion Financial Corp. has not originated any new taxi medallion loans since 2015) and is working with MSC to service its remaining portfolio as it winds down. 
 In 2019, the Bank launched a strategic partnership program to provide lending and other services to financial technology, or fintech, companies. The Bank entered into an initial partnership in 2020 and began issuing its first loans. The Bank continues to evaluate and launch additional partnership programs with fintech companies. 
 We continue to consider various alternatives for the Bank, which may include an initial public offering of its common stock, the sale of all or part of the Bank, a spin-off or other potential transaction. We do not have a deadline for its consideration of these alternatives, and there can be no assurance that this process will result in any transaction being announced or consummated.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations. At September 30, 2024, we identified our policies for the allowance for credit losses, goodwill and intangible assets, and deferred taxes, to be critical accounting policies because management has to make subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Our critical accounting policies are described in detail in Part I, Item 7 in Medallion Financial Corp.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and there have been no material changes in such policies and estimates since the date of such report. 
 RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 On January 1, 2023, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, "Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments", or ASC 326, which replaced the incurred loss methodology that delayed recognition until it was probable a loss had been incurred with a lifetime expected loss methodology using "reasonable and supportable" expectations about the future, referred to as the current expected credit loss, or CECL, methodology. For consumer loans, we use historical delinquent loan performance and actual loss rates modified by quantitative adjustments based on macroeconomic factors over a twelve-month reasonable and supportable forecast period. For commercial loans, we assess the historical impact that macroeconomic indicators have had on the loan portfolio, to determine an approximate allowance for credit loss. Unlike consumer loans, where loans may have similar performing characteristics, each commercial loan is unique. We evaluate each commercial loan for specific impairment with additional allowance for credit losses recognized as necessary. For taxi medallion loans, we maintain specific reserves adjusting the carrying amount of loans down to net collateral value. The allowance is evaluated on a quarterly basis by management based on the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and size of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions, and excess concentration risks. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates, including those based on changes in economic conditions, that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Credit losses are deducted from the allowance, and subsequent recoveries are added back to the allowance. 
 We adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022 are presented under ASC 326. The transition to the CECL methodology on January 1, 2023 resulted in an increase of 13.7 million to our allowance for credit losses on loans, or ACL, and a net-of-tax cumulative-effect adjustment of 9.9 million to the beginning balance of retained earnings. The CECL methodology transition effects on the allowance for credit losses are presented in the following table:

Prior to January 1, 2023, we used historical delinquency and actual loss rates with a three-year look-back period for taxi medallion loans and a one-year look-back period for recreation and home improvement loans and used historical loss experience and other projections for commercial loans. The allowance was evaluated on a quarterly basis by management based on the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and size of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers' ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions, and excess concentration risks. This evaluation was inherently subjective, as it required estimates that were susceptible to significant revision as more information became available. 
 In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements. The amendments in this update seek to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements. The amendments in this update will be effective on the date on which the SEC s removal of related disclosures from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K become effective, with early adoption prohibited. 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting, or Topic 280: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The main objective of this update is to improve financial reporting disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and to be included in interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are assessing the impact of the update on the accompanying financial statements. 
 Page 37 of 61 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes, or Topic 740: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The main objective of this update is to provide transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments in this update are effective for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are assessing the impact of the update on the accompanying financial statements. 
 CONTROL STATUTES AND REGULATIONS 
 Because the Bank is an insured depository institution within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act as well as Medallion Financial Corp. being a financial institution holding company within the meaning of the Utah Financial Institutions Act, federal and Utah law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of the Bank or Medallion Financial Corp., without, in most cases, prior written approval of the FDIC or the Commissioner of the Utah Department of Financial Institutions, as applicable. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, control is conclusively presumed if, among other things, a person or company acquires 25 or more of any class of the Bank s voting stock. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires 10 or more of any class of voting stock and is subject to several specified control factors as set forth in the applicable regulations. Although the Bank is an insured depository institution within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, your investment in the Company is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC, or any other agency, and is subject to loss. 
 Under the Utah Financial Institutions Act, control is defined as the power, directly or indirectly, or through or in concert with one or more persons to: (a) direct or exercise a controlling influence over (i) the management or policies of a financial institution or (ii) the election of a majority of the directors or trustees of an institution; or (b) to vote 25 or more of any class of voting securities of a financial institution. In addition, under Utah law, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person has control of a Utah financial institution if the person has the power, directly or indirectly, or through or in concert with one or more persons, to vote more than 10 but not less than 25 of any class of voting securities of a financial institution. If any holder of any series of the Bank s preferred stock is or becomes entitled to vote for the election of the Bank s directors, such series will be deemed a class of voting stock, and any other person will be required to obtain the non-objection of the FDIC under the Change in Bank Control Act to acquire or maintain 10 or more of that series. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our common stock in excess of the amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval. 
 In addition to the regulations detailed above, our operations are subject to supervision and regulation by other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Additionally, our operations may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions. This oversight may serve to: 
 regulate credit granting activities, including establishing licensing requirements, if any, in various jurisdictions; 

establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; 

require disclosures to customers; 

govern secured transactions; 

set collection, foreclosure, repossession, and claims handling procedures and other trade practices; 

prohibit discrimination in the extension of credit and administration of loans; and 

regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower s credit experience and other data collection. 

Changes to laws of states in which we do business could affect the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. We cannot predict whether such changes will occur or, if they occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon our financial condition or results of operations.

(1) Includes deferred financing costs of 8.4 million and 8.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our loans receivable yielded 12.12 , as compared to 11.73 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 39 basis point increase reflects a higher yield on our consumer and commercial loan portfolios, as we have increased the rates charged on new originations over the past year as prevailing market interest rates remained high. Similarly, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our loans receivable yielded 12.02 , as compared to 11.62 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We have used the higher interest rate environment as an opportunity to both increase the rates on newly issued recreation and home improvement loans, which is expected to continue to increase the yield on these portfolios over time. Additionally, we have used the higher interest rate environment as an opportunity to increase the credit quality of our new issuances all while receiving a yield higher than what would typically be attainable in a lower interest rate environment. This is particularly the case in our recreation segment, with the average FICO scores, measured at origination, of our recreation loans outstanding being 685 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 682 as of September 30, 2023. We use weighted average FICO scores as an indicator of portfolio risk. 
 Page 40 of 61 

Our debt, with certificates of deposits being our largest source, funds our growing lending business. Our average interest cost for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 4.05 and 3.86 increased 77 and 84 basis points from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, attributable to the current higher interest rate environment, particularly the higher cost associated with our deposits. To the extent that prevailing market interest rates remain at current levels, we expect our cost of funds to continue to increase as we issue new certificates of deposit to replace maturing certificates of deposit and fund our growth. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued deposits for three-month certificates at rates as high as 4.95 , 4.65 for 36 month certificates, and 4.25 for 60 month certificates, with the most recent 36 month and 60 month issuances being at rates of 3.80 . As described above, we have taken, and continue to take, steps to pass along a portion of the interest rate increases on newly originated loans, the process for which is slower than the pace of funding cost increases, thereby compressing our net interest margins. 
 The yield we earn on our loans is a function of the rates we are able to charge on those loans which are governed, to an extent, by the overall interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve s decision to decrease interest rates in September 2024 by 50 basis points, as well as the market s sentiment on the timing of that and future decisions, may have a direct impact on the rates we are able to charge on new loan originations. Likewise, the cost of new borrowings, particularly deposits, is also tied to the market s sentiment of the timing of future interest rate decisions. To the extent that further interest rate decreases are anticipated, we could expect a decrease in both the rate charged on new loan originations as well as a decrease in the cost of newly issued borrowings.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in interest income was mainly driven by the increase in the size of the consumer loan portfolios, as well as an increase in overall yield on interest-earning assets as we issue new loans at interest rates greater than the weighted average rates of our current portfolio. For the same periods, the increase in interest expense was driven by an increase in borrowing costs, primarily due to the increases in deposits and growth of our total borrowings which fund our growing loan portfolio, and in interest rates. 
 Our interest expense is driven by the interest rates payable on our bank certificates of deposit, privately placed notes, fixed-rate, long-term debentures issued to the SBA, trust preferred securities, and has historically included credit facilities with banks and other short-term notes payable. The Bank issues brokered time certificates of deposit, which are, on average, our lowest borrowing costs. The Bank is able to bid on these deposits at a variety of maturity options, which allows for more flexible interest rate management strategies. As further described below, in September 2023, we issued and sold 39.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.25 senior notes due in September 2028, in June 2024, we amended our senior notes previously issued in December 2023, increasing the aggregate principal amount from 12.5 million to 17.5 million, reducing the interest rate to 8.875 from 9.0 , and extending the maturity date from December 2033 to June 2039, and in August 2024, we issued and sold 5.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625 senior notes due in August 2039. The net proceeds were used, in large part, to repurchase and settle, in full, 36.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.25 senior notes issued in 2019 and which matured in March 2024, as well as for general corporate purposes. 
 Our cost of funds is primarily driven by the rates paid on our various borrowings and changes in the levels of average borrowings outstanding. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for details on the terms of our outstanding debt. Our debentures issued to the SBA typically have terms of ten years. 
 We measure our borrowing costs as our aggregate interest expense for all of our interest-bearing liabilities divided by the average amount of such liabilities outstanding during the period. The above table presents the average borrowings and related borrowing costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We expect our borrowing costs to further increase as we take deposits and borrow other funds at the currently higher prevailing rates. 
 We continue to seek SBA funding through Medallion Capital to the extent it offers attractive rates. SBA financing subjects its recipients to limits on the amount of secured bank debt they may incur. We use SBA funding to fund loans that qualify under the Small Business Investment Act of 1985, as amended, or the SBIA, and SBA regulations. In July 2023, we obtained a 20.0 million commitment from the SBA, 9.8 million of which has been utilized as of September 30, 2024, with 10.2 million currently drawable. In February 2024, we obtained an 18.5 million commitment from the SBA, with 0.3 million currently drawable, and the balance of 18.2 million drawable upon the infusion of 9.1 million of capital. 
 At September 30, 2024 and 2023, adjustable rate debt constituted less than 2 of total debt, and was comprised solely of our trust preferred securities borrowings.

LOANS 
 Loans are reported at the principal amount outstanding, inclusive of deferred loan acquisition costs, which primarily includes deferred fees paid to or received from loan originators, and which are amortized to interest income over the life of the loan. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was continued growth in the recreation segment, growing 12 from December 31, 2023, while home improvement loans increased 2 from December 31, 2023.

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
 The allowance is maintained at a level estimated by management to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolios based on management s quarterly evaluation of the portfolios, the related credit characteristics, and macroeconomic factors affecting the portfolios. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance totaled 96.5 million and 84.2 million, which represented 3.88 and 3.80 of total loans, respectively. The provision for credit losses was 20.2 million and 55.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.5 million and 27.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of lower taxi medallion recoveries, higher charge off activity, and increased provisions necessary with the growth in our recreation loans and, to a lesser extent, in our home improvement loans, as well as the credit loss allowance required due to the impact fluctuating delinquencies have on our credit loss model. 
 The following table presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

(1) Collateral valuation adjustments for recreational loans are generally the result of the liquidation of collateral through a repossession process. Due to the short-term nature of the liquidation process, collateral valuation adjustments on recreational loans are recorded as charge-offs to the allowance for credit losses on loans as this is an adjustment to the initial estimate on the fair value, less estimated costs to sell that was initially estimated in the preliminary charge off and amount transferred to collateral in the process of foreclosure.

SEGMENT RESULTS 
 We manage our financial results under four operating segments; recreation lending, home improvement lending, commercial lending, and taxi medallion lending. We also present results for a non-operating segment, corporate and other investments. 
 Recreation Lending 
 Recreation lending is a growth business focused on originating prime and non-prime recreation loans which is a significant source of income for us, accounting for 67 of our interest income for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We maintain relationships with approximately 3,300 dealers and financial service providers, or FSPs, not all of which are active at any one time. FSPs are entities that provide finance and insurance services to small dealers that do not have the desire or ability to provide such services themselves. The ability of FSPs to aggregate the financing and relationship management for many small dealers makes them valuable. We receive approximately half of our loan volume from dealers and the other half from FSPs. Our top ten dealer and FSP relationships were responsible for 39 of recreation lending s new loan originations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 41 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The percentage of new loan originations by the top ten dealer and FSP relationships is a measure of concentration, which management uses to determine whether to undertake diversification efforts, and which provides investors with information about origination concentration. 
 The recreation loan portfolio consists of thousands of geographically distributed loans with an average loan size of approximately 21,000 as of September 30, 2024. The loans are fixed rate with an average term at origination for loans originated in the current year of approximately 14 years. The weighted average maturity of our loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 is approximately 11 years. 
 The loans are secured primarily by RVs, boats, collector cars, and trailers, with RV loans making up 55 of the portfolio, boat loans making up 20 , and collector cars making up 11 of the portfolio as of September 30, 2024, compared to 58 , 20 , and 9 as of September 30, 2023. Recreation loans are made to borrowers residing nationwide, with the highest concentrations in Texas and Florida at 16 and 10 of loans outstanding, compared to 15 and 10 as of September 30, 2023, and with no other states at or above 10 . As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average FICO scores, measured at origination, of our recreation loans outstanding were 685 and 682. The weighted average FICO scores at the time of origination for the loans funded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 686 and 682. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the recreation loan portfolio grew 16 to 1.6 billion, with the average interest rate increasing 19 basis points to 14.92 from a year ago. Additionally, reserve rates increased 29 basis points to 4.53 from September 30, 2023, reflecting higher delinquency and potential loss. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated 454.4 million in recreation loans, compared to 384.3 million in the prior year period. Originations increased despite restrictive underwriting standards and management's efforts to mitigate concentration risks. The following table presents quarterly originations for 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Home Improvement Lending 
 The home improvement lending segment works with contractors and FSPs to finance home improvements and is concentrated in roofs, swimming pools, and windows at 38 , 24 , and 13 of total loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 40 , 19 , and 13 as of September 30, 2023, with no other collateral types over 10 . Home improvement loans are made to borrowers residing nationwide, with the highest concentrations in Texas and Florida, each representing 11 of loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and with each state representing 10 as of September 30, 2023, with no other states at or above 10 . As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average FICO scores of our home improvement loans outstanding, measured at origination, were 766 and 763. The weighted average FICO scores at the time of origination for the loans funded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 781 and 755. 
 A large proportion of our home improvement-financed sales are facilitated by contractor salespeople with limited financing backgrounds rather than by contractor employees who provide financing services. The result is contractor demand for financing services that facilitate an in-home transaction (e.g., digital tools, including mobile applications for phone or tablet, support for E-SIGN compliant electronic signatures, and extended operating hours), and additional resources for the salesperson throughout the financing process. We currently maintain relationships with approximately 900 contractors and FSPs. Our top ten contractors and FSP relationships were responsible for 35 of home improvement lending s new loan originations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The percentage of new loan originations by the top ten contractor and FSP relationships is a measure of concentration, which management uses to determine whether to undertake diversification efforts, and which provides investors with information about origination concentration. 
 The home improvement loan portfolio consists of thousands of geographically distributed loans with an average loan size of approximately 21,000 as of September 30, 2024. The loans are fixed rate with an average term at origination, for loans originated in the current year of approximately 15 years. The weighted average maturity of our loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 is approximately 12 years. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the home improvement portfolio increased 7 to 814.1 million, with reserve coverage rates increasing 12 basis points to 2.42 from a year ago reflecting higher delinquency and potential losses. The average interest rate increased 38 basis points to 9.76 at September 30, 2024 from a year ago. 
 Page 48 of 61 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated 216.1 million in home improvement loans, compared to 291.3 million in the prior year period. The decrease was driven in part by ongoing restrictive underwriting standards in 2024 and management's efforts to mitigate concentration risks. The following table presents quarterly originations for 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Commercial Lending 
 We originate both senior and subordinated loans nationwide to businesses in a variety of industries, with California, Wisconsin, and Texas each having 30 , 11 , and 10 of the segment portfolio, and no other states having a concentration at or above 10 . These mezzanine loans are primarily secured by a second position on all assets of the businesses and generally range in amount from 2.5 million to 6.0 million at origination, and typically include an equity component as part of the financing. These equity components, although a small portion of the overall financing, have the potential to generate significant yield enhancement when the underlying portfolio company enters a capital transaction. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net gains of 3.1 million were recognized with respect to these equity investments. The commercial lending business has concentrations in manufacturing, construction, and wholesale trade making up 55 , 14 , and 11 , of the loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated 7.0 million in new commercial loans, compared to 16.7 million in the 2023 period. 
 The following table presents certain financial data and ratios as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The commercial segment encompasses the mezzanine lending business, and the other legacy commercial loans (immaterial to total) have been allocated to corporate and other investments.

Taxi Medallion Lending 
 The taxi medallion lending segment operates in the New York City metropolitan area. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, taxi medallion values remained consistent in the New York City and Newark markets with all other markets being valued at 0. We continued to not recognize interest income with all loans being placed on nonaccrual as of the third quarter 2020 (except for settled loans with interest being paid in excess of the loan balance), and by transferring underperforming loans from the portfolio to loan collateral in process of foreclosure with charge-offs to collateral value, once loans become more than 120 days past due. All the loans are secured by taxi medallions and enhanced by personal guarantees of the shareholders and owners. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we collected 4.1 million and 9.5 million related to taxi medallion and related assets, which resulted in net recoveries and gains of 2.8 million and 5.6 million in those periods. The amount of cash collected as well as recoveries recorded vary greatly from period to period due to a wide variety of circumstances surrounding each of the underlying assets, and while we continue to focus on collection and recovery efforts, it is unlikely that there will be future collections at the higher levels experienced in the prior year.

Corporate and Other Investments 
 This non-operating segment includes our equity and investment securities as well as our legacy commercial business, and other assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, including goodwill and intangible assets, which are not specifically allocated to the operating segments and are not used in evaluating performance of the operating segments. Commencing with the 2020 second quarter, the Bank began issuing loans related to the new strategic partnership business, which is included within this segment. The associated activities of the strategic partnership business are currently limited to originating loans or other receivables facilitated by our strategic partners and selling those loans or receivables to our strategic partners or other third parties, without recourse, within a specified time after origination, such as three business days. Strategic partnerships loans were 3.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and 1.8 million as of September 30, 2023, with originations of 39.9 million and 80.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 36.5 million and 96.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net income attributable to shareholders was 8.6 million and 25.7 million, or 0.37 and 1.09 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.2 million and 40.8 million, or 0.48 and 1.77 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Total interest income was 76.4 million and 214.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 65.9 million and 183.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income reflects the continued growth in our recreation, home improvement, and, to a lesser extent, commercial lending segments and an increased weighted average interest rate on the loan portfolio. The yield on interest earning assets was 11.75 and 11.54 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.28 and 11.10 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase reflects higher interest rates on new originations in our recreation and home improvement lending segments, with the yield anticipated to continue to increase as older loans with lower rates amortize and newer originations at the higher current rates become a larger portion of our portfolio. 
 Loans before allowance for credit losses were 2.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, comprised of recreation 1.6 billion), home improvement 814.1 million), commercial 110.1 million), taxi medallion 3.2 million), and strategic partnership 3.2 million) loans. We had an allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 of 96.5 million, which was attributable to recreation (73 ), home improvement (21 ), commercial (5 ), and taxi medallion (1 loans. 
 Loans increased 99.7 million, or 4 , during the quarter and 269.4 million, or 12 , from December 31, 2023 as a result of 275.6 million and 757.8 million of loan originations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by principal payments, and to a lesser extent, charge-offs and transfers to loan collateral in process of foreclosure. The provisions for credit losses were 20.2 million and 55.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.5 million and 27.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of lower taxi medallion recoveries, higher charge-off activity, partly attributable to seasonality, and increased provisions with the growth in our loan portfolios. The provision for credit loss in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 2.3 million and 4.1 million of net recoveries with respect to the taxi medallion lending segment, as compared to 1.7 million and 6.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting continued recovery efforts with the impaired taxi medallion portfolio, while net charge-offs in the recreation and home improvement lending segments increased to 15.8 million and 47.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.0 million and 31.0 million in the prior year periods. Gross charge-offs were 20.5 million and 62.2 million in the consumer portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15.6 million and 41.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Charge-offs in the consumer segment correlate to delinquency status, which has seen improvement from December 31, 2023, consistent with seasonal trends. 
 Interest expense was 23.7 million and 63.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17.1 million and 44.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting both higher average borrowings and higher average borrowing costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, with borrowing costs expected to further increase in the current rate environment. The average cost of borrowed funds was 4.05 and 3.86 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.28 and 3.02 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases of 77 basis points and 84 basis points for the three and nine month periods are largely attributable to the increased cost of newly issued certificates of deposit used both to fund our growth and to replace older maturing vintages with lower rates, and to a lesser extent, increased costs and outstanding balances with both our privately placed notes and SBA debentures. As we replace upcoming deposit maturities with new issues, we expect our cost of funds to further increase. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued certificates of deposit at rates up to 5.20 for six-month issuances and at rates up to 4.25 and as low as 3.80 for five year certificates of deposit, with the decrease tied to market expectations of the interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve. In addition, we expect our interest expense related to SBA borrowings to increase as newly issued SBA debentures carry a higher rate when compared to some of our previously issued debentures. Average debt outstanding was 2.3 billion and 2.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, up from 2.1 billion and 2.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as we have increased our borrowings, particularly certificates of deposit, and to a lesser extent private notes and SBA debentures, to fund our loan growth. See page 39 for tables that present average balances and cost of funds for our funding sources.

Net interest income was 52.7 million and 150.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 48.8 million and 139.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net interest margin before the impact of the allowance for credit losses was 8.11 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.35 and 8.42 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the above, particularly the rising cost of borrowings experienced over the prior year period, offset to an extent by higher yields on loans and investments compared to the prior year period. With the rates we charge on outstanding loans being fixed, and our cost of funds increasing, our net interest margin has tightened over the prior periods as we can only increase our yield through higher rates charged on new originations. We expect this trend of tightening margins to continue to some degree as our cost of funds, particularly on deposits continues to increase, with the current average rate on deposits of 3.68 being lower than our new issuance costs. 
 Net other income, which is comprised primarily of gains on the sale of loans and taxi medallions, gains (losses) on equity investments, prepayment fees, servicing fee income, late charges, and write-downs of loan collateral, was 0.6 million and 7.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.3 million and 8.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which reflected larger gains on the sale of taxi medallion assets. 
 Operating expenses were 19.0 million and 57.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 19.1 million and 56.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Salaries and benefits were 9.5 million and 28.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.6 million and 27.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting a greater head count at our operating subsidiaries, Medallion Bank and Medallion Capital, and higher equity compensation costs in the current quarter, offset by lower accruals for compensation tied to performance. Legal and professional fees were 0.8 million and 3.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, down from 1.1 million and 4.2 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. While costs in the current three and nine month periods were down compared to the prior year periods, we had higher than anticipated expenses associated with the successful defense of an activist proxy campaign in 2024, which approximated 1.4 million. Although legal costs associated with the SEC litigation were nominal in both the current and prior year periods, we continue to maintain an approximate 6.5 million liability as a result of the collection of insurance coverage with respect to costs incurred in previous years. The Company anticipates recognizing the benefit of this liability, offsetting future costs, through the remainder of this matter. 
 Loan collateral in process of foreclosure was 8.8 million at September 30, 2024, down from 11.8 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease primarily reflects cash payments received during the period. 
 ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 We, like other financial institutions, are subject to interest rate risk to the extent that our interest-earning assets (consisting of consumer, commercial, and taxi medallion loans, and investment securities) reprice on a different basis over time in comparison to our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of bank certificates of deposit, SBA debentures and borrowings, historically credit facilities, and borrowings from banks and other lenders). 
 Having interest-bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates, although such an asset/liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates. Abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates. Conversely, having interest-earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates, although this asset/liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates. This mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk. 
 The effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio. We believe that the average life of our loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates. Borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates. Conversely, borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment. However, borrowers may prepay for a variety of other reasons, such as to monetize increases in the underlying collateral values. In addition, we manage our exposure to increases in market rates of interest by incurring fixed-rate indebtedness, such as ten year subordinated SBA debentures, and by setting repricing intervals on certificates of deposit, for terms of up to five years. 
 A relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from our interest rate sensitivity gap. The interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which mature and/or reprice within specified intervals of time. The gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities, and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets. A relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets. 
 Page 54 of 61 

The following table presents our interest rate sensitivity gap at September 30, 2024. The principal amounts of interest earning assets are assigned to the time frames in which such principal amounts are contractually obligated to be repriced. We do not reflect any prepayment assumptions in preparing the analysis, despite historical average life experience being significantly shorter than contractual terms.

Our interest rate sensitive assets were 2.7 billion and interest rate sensitive liabilities were 2.4 billion at September 30, 2024. The one-year cumulative interest rate gap was a negative 777.3 million, or 29 of interest rate sensitive assets. We seek to manage interest rate risk by incurring fixed-rate indebtedness, by evaluating appropriate derivatives, pursuing securitization opportunities, entering into borrowing arrangements with terms that align with the anticipated life of our assets, and using other options consistent with managing interest rate risk. 
 LIBOR terminated on June 30, 2023. We did not have loans tied to LIBOR. Our trust preferred securities bore a variable rate of interest of 90-day LIBOR plus 2.13 until June 30, 2023. For these borrowings, the 90-day Secured Overnight Financing Rate adjusted by a relevant spread adjustment of approximately 26 basis points replaced the previous LIBOR-based rate. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our sources of liquidity include brokered certificates of deposit and other borrowings at the Bank, unfunded commitments to sell debentures to the SBA, loan amortization and prepayments, private and public issuances of debt securities, participations or sales of loans to third parties, issuances of preferred securities at our subsidiaries, and the disposition of our other assets. 
 In August 2024, we completed a private placement to certain institutional investors of 5.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625 unsecured senior notes due August 2039, with interest payable semiannually. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes. 
 In June 2024, we amended the notes previously issued in a private placement to certain institutional investors in December 2023, increasing the principal amount from 12.5 million to 17.5 million, reducing the interest rate to 8.875 from 9.0 , and extending the maturity date from December 2033 to June 2039. We used, and intend to use, the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of the remaining 8.25 notes that matured in March 2024 described below. 
 In September 2023, we completed a private placement to certain institutional investors of 39.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.25 unsecured senior notes due September 2028, with interest payable semiannually. 
 In April 2023, the Bank began to originate retail savings deposits through a third-party service provider and, as of September 30, 2024, the Bank had 10.9 million in retail savings deposit balances. 
 Page 55 of 61 

In March 2023, the Bank established a discount window line of credit at the Federal Reserve. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had 110.1 million in home improvement loans pledged as collateral to the Federal Reserve. The current advance rate on the pledged securities is approximately 45.1 of book value, for a total of approximately 49.7 million in secured borrowing capacity, of which 35.0 million was utilized as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Bank has borrowing arrangements with two commercial banks. These agreements are accommodations that can be terminated at any time, for any reason, and allow the Bank to borrow up to 75.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding amounts with respect to these arrangements. 
 In February 2021, we completed a private placement to certain institutional investors of 25.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.25 unsecured senior notes due February 2026, with interest payable semiannually. Follow-on offerings of these notes in March and April 2021 raised an additional 3.3 million and 3.0 million. 
 In December 2020, we completed a private placement to certain institutional investors of 33.6 million aggregate principal amount of 7.50 unsecured senior notes due December 2027, with interest payable semiannually. Follow-on offerings of these notes in February and March 2021 raised an additional 8.5 million. In April 2021, we raised an additional 11.7 million in a follow-on offering and repaid substantially all of our remaining bank borrowings. 
 In December 2019, the Bank closed an initial public offering of 1,840,000 shares of its Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series F, with a 46.0 million aggregate liquidation amount, yielding net proceeds of 42.5 million, which were recorded in the Bank s shareholders equity. Dividends are payable quarterly from the date of issuance to, but excluding April 1, 2025, at a rate of 8 per annum, and from and including April 1, 2025, at a floating rate equal to a benchmark rate (which is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, and is expected to be three-month Term SOFR) plus a spread of 6.46 per annum. 
 The net proceeds from the December 2020, February 2021, March 2021, April 2021, September 2023, December 2023 (as amended and increased in June 2024), and August 2024 private placements were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding debt, including repayment of our 9.00 retail notes at maturity in April 2021 and to pay down other borrowings, including some borrowings at a discount, and to repurchase, repay, and cancel 36.0 million of our 8.25 notes, which matured in March 2024. 
 The table below presents the components of our debt as of September 30, 2024, exclusive of deferred financing costs of 8.4 million. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the contractual terms of our borrowings.

In addition, the illiquidity of portions of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of them at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments. In addition, if we were required to liquidate some or all of our portfolio, the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments. Because we borrow money to make loans and investments, our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income. In periods of sharply rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which would reduce our net interest income. 
 We use a combination of long-term and short-term borrowings and equity capital to finance our lending and investing activities. Our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed primarily with fixed-rate debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity a hypothetical immediate 1 increase in interest rates would result in an increase to net income as of September 30, 2024 by 1.9 million on an annualized basis, and the impact of such an immediate increase of 1 over a one year period would have been a reduction in net income by 2.6 million at September 30, 2024. Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size, and composition of the assets on the balance sheet, and other business developments that could affect net income from operations in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates. 
 From time to time, we work with investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries to investigate the viability of several other financing options which include, among others, the sale or spinoff of certain assets or divisions, the development of a securitization conduit program, and other independent financing for certain subsidiaries or asset classes. These financing options would also provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth. 
 The following table illustrates sources of available funds for us and each of our subsidiaries, and amounts outstanding under trust preferred securities and borrowings and their respective end of period weighted average interest rates at September 30, 2024. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about each borrowing.

(1) Cash resides in the applicable SBIC and is generally not available for corporate use. 

(2) Includes deposits of 2.3 million related to the strategic partnership business and 10.9 million related to listing services. 

Loan amortization, prepayments, and sales also provide a source of funding for us. Prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates, taxi medallion loan market values, economic conditions, and competition. 
 We also generate liquidity through deposits generated at the Bank, the offering of privately placed notes, through the issuance of SBA debentures, through our trust preferred securities, and through preferred securities at our subsidiaries and have utilized borrowing arrangements with other banks in the past, as well as from cash flow from operations. In addition, we may choose to participate out a greater portion of our loan portfolio to third parties. We regularly seek additional sources of liquidity; however, given current market conditions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional liquidity on terms favorable to us or at all. If that occurs, we may decline to underwrite lower yielding loans in order to conserve capital until credit conditions in the market become more favorable; or we may be required to dispose of assets when we would not otherwise do so, and at prices which may be below the net book value of such assets in order for us to repay indebtedness on a timely basis.

Dividends and Stock Repurchases 
 Beginning in March 2022, the Company's board of directors reinstated our quarterly dividend. A dividend of 0.08 per share was paid in March, May, and August 2023. On October 24, 2023, the Company s board of directors authorized and increased the quarterly dividend to 0.10 per share, and a dividend of 0.10 per share was paid in November 2023, March 2024, May 2024, and August 2024. On October 25, 2024, the Company s board of directors further authorized and increased the quarterly dividend to 0.11 per share, to be paid in November 2024. The Company currently expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends at the current rate for the foreseeable future. We may, however, re-evaluate the dividend policy in the future depending on market conditions. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay any cash distributions, as we may retain our earnings to facilitate the growth of our business, to finance our investments, to provide liquidity, or for other corporate purposes. 
 On April 29, 2022, our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program with no expiration date, pursuant to which we were authorized to repurchase up to 35 million of our shares, which was increased to 40 million on August 10, 2022, also with no expiration date. Such new repurchase program replaced the previous one, which was terminated. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 122,344 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of 1.0 million. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, up to 15,392,299 of shares remained authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
