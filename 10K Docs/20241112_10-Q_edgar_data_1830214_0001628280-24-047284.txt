No fractional shares of Class A common stock will be issued upon exercise of the Warrants; therefore, a minimum of Warrants must be exercised to receive any entitlement. For the avoidance of doubt, no other amendment, modification, alteration or change was made to the terms of the Warrants as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.

 million was reclassified from non-cash customer consideration to other non-cash activity and (ii) million was reclassified from other financing activities to proceeds from exercise of stock options. The total cash used in operating and financing activities for the nine months ended September 31, 2023 is not changed as a result of these reclassifications. 
 Significant Accounting Policies 
 There have been no new or material changes to the Company s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the significant accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Company's 2023 consolidated financial statements included in the Company's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 million and was paid with the issuance of million shares of Ginkgo's Class A common stock. The Company accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since substantially all of the value received was concentrated in the acquired developed technology, which is being amortized over a useful life of . 
 Zymergen 
 On October 3, 2023, and in connection with the Zymergen Bankruptcy, as defined and discussed in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Zymergen (the Zymergen APA as the stalking horse bidder under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to acquire exclusive rights to substantially all of Zymergen s intellectual property assets and certain other assets. 
 On January 18, 2024 (the Closing Date ), the Company, through certain of its affiliates, completed its acquisition of substantially all of Zymergen s assets under the Zymergen APA, and on February 5, 2024, Zymergen s plan of liquidation was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. All of the Company s interests in the Zymergen entities were extinguished and terminated as of February 23, 2024. The acquisition under the Zymergen APA was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805 and was not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. The total cash purchase price was million, with million paid at closing and million released from escrow. The

 million of operating lease right-of-use assets, million of property and equipment, and million of operating lease liabilities. goodwill or intangible assets were recognized. Transaction costs associated with the Zymergen APA were material for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other Acquisitions 
 The Company completed other asset acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisitions was million and was paid with the issuance of million shares of Ginkgo's Class A common stock. Each transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition as the acquired assets, consisting primarily of intellectual property rights, did not meet the definition of a business. The assets acquired represent in-process research and development with no alternative future use. Accordingly, the Company recorded million as acquired in-process research and development expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Divestiture 
 On September 30, 2024, the Company sold the equity interests of its former subsidiary Altar SAS Altar for a nominal amount. As a result of the sale, the Company deconsolidated all of Altar's assets and liabilities from its consolidated financial statements effective September 30, 2024, and recognized a loss on deconsolidation of 7.0 million in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The loss on deconsolidation includes a 1.5 million reclassification of accumulated currency translation adjustments to earnings. The sale did not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation.

 , and the planned consolidation and sublease of certain facilities. Initial workforce reductions commenced in June 2024 and continued into the third quarter, with further reductions expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025. All reductions are expected to be substantially completed in 2025, subject to compliance with applicable laws. The Company plans to consolidate certain facilities through various actions, including combining office and laboratory operations into fewer locations, subleasing unused facilities, and has taken or plans to take other related measures, such as the sale of its subsidiary, Altar, in the third quarter of 2024 (see Note 2 ). While the Company aims to complete the majority of its facility consolidation actions in 2025, the actual timing may vary, especially for subleasing unused or underutilized facilities, which may extend beyond 2025 or may not occur prior to termination of such lease, depending on market conditions. Additionally, restructuring expenses related to potential asset impairments or contract amendments or terminations for any facilities no longer in use or underutilized could be material. 
 
 The costs for the reduction in force are expected to range from million to million primarily in the Cell Engineering segment and consist of one-time cash severance and related costs. The employee termination costs are recognized as of the communication date to employees, given (i) the Company instituted a one-time employee termination benefit related to its restructuring, and (ii) the employees will not be retained to render service beyond a minimum retention period. The Company is currently unable to estimate the costs associated with consolidating its facilities. These costs may include, but are not limited to, losses on subleases, contract terminations, asset impairments, sale or disposal of equipment or other long-lived assets, and related costs and fees pertaining to the consolidation, closure, or disposition of facilities. Additional charges may be incurred as the Company progresses its restructuring plan and such charges could be material.

 Impairment of right-of-use asset (1) 
 Total restructuring 
 (1) Relates to a sublease of a facility in connection with the restructuring and reflects the excess of the right-of-use asset's carrying value over its fair value, which was determined based on estimates of future discounted cash flows and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 Additionally, the Company recorded a 7.0 million loss on the sale and deconsolidation of Altar as a component of other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 (1) The fair value of Synlogic, Inc. warrants is calculated as the quoted price of the underlying common stock, less the unpaid exercise price of the warrants. 
 (2) Marketable equity securities classified as Level 2 reflect a discount for lack of marketability due to regulatory sales restrictions. 
 
 Transfers to and from Levels 1, 2 and 3 are recognized at the end of the reporting period in which a change in valuation technique or methodology occurs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 occurred due to lapse of regulatory sales restrictions on marketable equity securities. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a portion of the Private Placement Warrants' estimated fair value was transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 as a result of the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants when transferred to anyone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, leading the Company to determine their fair value to be equivalent to that of the Public Warrants. There were no other transfers between Levels 1, 2, or 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.

 Notes Receivable 
 For all of its notes receivable, the Company has elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 The Company's notes receivable consisted of a senior secured note in the principal amount of million and a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of million, both issued by Bolt Threads, Inc. Bolt Threads ). The senior secured note bears interest at per annum, is due December 31, 2027 and is included in other non-current assets at its estimated fair value. The convertible promissory note bore interest at per annum, was convertible into equity securities of Bolt Threads upon a qualified financing, a non-qualified financing, or special purpose acquisition company transaction, at a conversion price based on certain conditions as defined in the note agreement, or was otherwise payable on demand any time after the maturity date of October 4, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, 10.5 million in principal and accrued interest on the convertible promissory note was converted into million shares of Bolt Threads' common stock, which is classified as a marketable equity security. 
 The Company used the yield method to value the senior secured note. Under this method, the estimated future cash flows, consisting of principal and interest payments, are discounted to present value using an applicable market yield or discount rate. Increases or decreases in the market yield or discount rate would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, in the fair value measurement. The market yield is determined using a corporate bond yield curve corresponding to the credit rating category of the issuer. The fair value of the senior secured note is based on observable market inputs, which represents a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. 
 In addition to the convertible promissory note issued by Bolt Threads, the Company holds a series of convertible debt instruments issued by customers as payment for Cell Engineering services. The Company used a scenario-based method to value the convertible debt instruments issued by customers. Under this method, future cash flows are evaluated under various payoff scenarios, probability-weighted, and discounted to present value. The significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs used in the fair value measurement as of September 30, 2024, included scenario probabilities ranging from to , a discount rate of , and estimated time to event date of up to . The significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs used in the fair value measurement as of December 31, 2023, included scenario probabilities ranging from to , a discount rate of and estimated time to event date of one to . Significant changes in these inputs could have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. As of September 30, 2024, the convertible debt instruments had an unpaid principal balance of million and a fair value of million. As of December 31, 2023, the convertible debt instruments had an unpaid principal balance of million and a fair value of million.

 Contingent Consideration 
 In connection with various business acquisitions, the Company is required to make contingent earnout payments payable upon the achievement of certain technical, commercial and/or performance milestones. The Company also issued restricted stock in connection with acquisitions, which is subject to vesting conditions and is classified as contingent consideration liability. 
 The Company can settle a majority of its contingent consideration liabilities in cash or shares of Class A common stock at the Company s election with the remainder payable in cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company settled million in contingent consideration liabilities through payment of million in cash and vesting of million shares of restricted stock valued at million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company settled million in contingent consideration liability through payment of million in cash and vesting of million shares of restricted stock valued at million. Of that amount, million was recorded as an increase to the acquired intangible asset with an offset to additional paid-in-capital as the contingent consideration liability was deemed not probable of occurring. 
 The fair value of contingent consideration related to earnout payments from acquisitions was estimated using unobservable (Level 3) inputs as illustrated in the table below. The fair value of contingent consideration related to restricted stock was estimated using the quoted price of Ginkgo's Class A common stock, an estimate of the number of shares expected to vest, probability of vesting, and a discount rate. Material increases or decreases in these inputs could result in a higher or lower fair value measurement. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company measures the fair value of certain assets, including investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values, on a nonrecurring basis when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, or when observable price changes occur for identical or similar securities from the same issuer. 
 The fair value of non-marketable equity securities is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy when the Company estimates fair value using unobservable inputs to measure the amount of the impairment loss. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities is classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy when the Company estimates fair value using the observable transaction price paid by third party investors for the identical or similar security of the same issuer. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a million impairment loss related to its investment in Genomatica preferred stock. The fair value measurement was determined using the guideline public company method under the market approach. The significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation included the selection and analysis of guideline public companies, revenue multiple and other unobservable assumptions. The fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received a total purchase amount of million in Simple Agreement for Future Equity SAFEs from customers as prepayment for Cell Engineering services. The Company used a scenario-based method to value the SAFEs as of each contract inception date, which resulted in total fair value of million. Under the scenario-based method, future cash flows were evaluated under qualified financing and dissolution scenarios with partial recovery and no recovery in dissolution. The cash flows under each scenario were probability-weighted and discounted to present value. The significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs used in the fair value measurement were scenario probabilities of to , a discount rate of and estimated time to event date of one to . 
 The Company recorded impairment losses of 5.2 million and 1.8 million related to SAFEs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value was generally estimated using the scenario-based method, where various payout scenarios were probability-weighted and discounted to present value.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview 
 Our mission is to make biology easier to engineer. 
 Ginkgo is the leading horizontal platform for cell programming, providing flexible, end-to-end services that solve challenges for organizations across diverse markets, from food and agriculture to pharmaceuticals to industrial and specialty chemicals. Ginkgo s Biosecurity business is building a global infrastructure for biosecurity to empower governments, communities, and public health leaders to prevent, detect and respond to a wide variety of biological threats. 
 We use our platform to program cells on behalf of our customers. These cell programs are designed to enable biological production of products as diverse as novel therapeutics, key food ingredients, and chemicals currently derived from petroleum. Biology did not evolve by end market. All of these applications run on cells which have a common code DNA and a common programming platform can enable all of them. Because of this shared platform, we are able to drive scale and learning efficiencies while maintaining flexibility and diversity in our program areas. Ultimately, customers come to us because they believe we maximize the probability of successfully developing their products. 
 The foundation of our cell programming platform includes two core assets that execute a wide variety of cell programs for customers according to their specifications: our Foundry and our Codebase. 
 Our Foundry is a highly automated, yet flexible, lab powered by proprietary automation and software to enable flexibility and scale. The Foundry automates lab workflows at high levels of abstraction, enabling users to generate potentially valuable datasets labeling broad genetic sequence design space with a wide range of functional data through modular design-build-test-learn cycles or campaigns. Our scale economic means that the Foundry s capacity to perform more and more diverse campaigns grows while the cost per campaign decreases. We call this scaling factor Knight s Law. 
 Our Codebase is a data asset which accumulates as we operate our Foundry in service of customer projects. Our Codebase includes vast amounts of data at different levels of characterization and usability in engineering projects, including: proprietary libraries of genetic sequence data that can be used for pretraining large language models via unsupervised learning, experimental data for fine tuning task-specific generative artificial intelligence AI models, as well as sequences and optimized host cells that can be directly reusable for different applications of cell engineering. 
 As the platform scales, we have observed a virtuous cycle between our Foundry, our Codebase, and the value we deliver to customers. We believe this virtuous cycle sustains Ginkgo s growth and differentiated value proposition. 
 Foundry: As we take on more work in the Foundry, we benefit from scale economics, which over time may lead to lower program costs. We expect that these lower costs, in turn, will drive additional demand for our cell programming capabilities. 
 Codebase: Cell programs also generate Codebase, which can drive better experimental direction and improve the odds of technical success, further increasing our customer value proposition, which we believe will result in additional demand. 
 Put simply: we believe that as we scale, the platform improves. We believe that this in turn yields better program execution and customer outcomes, ultimately driving more demand, which drives further investments in scale and platform improvements, and so on. We believe this positive feedback loop has the potential to drive compounding value creation in

 the future, as new programs typically contribute to both near-term revenues and have the potential to add significant downstream economics and more positive impact. 
 Our cell programming business model mirrors the structure of our platform and we are compensated in two primary ways. First, we charge usage fees for services, in much the same way that cloud computing companies charge usage fees for utilization of computing capacity or contract research organizations charge for services. Additionally, we typically negotiate a value share with our customers (typically in the form of royalties, milestones, and/or equity interests) in order to align our economics with the success of the programs enabled by our platform. As we add new programs, our portfolio of programs with this downstream value potential grows. Commencing in the second quarter of 2024, we announced changes in commercial terms, including the removal of downstream value share from certain program types. 
 With a mission to make biology easier to engineer, we have always recognized the need to invest in biosecurity as a key component of our platform. We are building the future bioeconomy with our customers and partners, and we envision the future of biosecurity as a global immune system equipped with the capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats. The first, critical step in realizing this future is to build a robust early warning system for biological threats this is the primary focus of Ginkgo s Biosecurity business. 
 Our biosecurity offering includes biomonitoring and bioinformatic support services internationally as well as domestically. We are currently offering biomonitoring and bioinformatic support services domestically through our partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and XpresCheck, and internationally such as through our international programs, including those in Qatar, Rwanda and Ukraine. 
 We operate in two reportable business segments: 
 Cell Engineering: Consists of research and development R D services performed under collaboration and license agreements relating to our cell programming platform. Our cell programming platform includes two core assets: the Foundry, highly efficient biology lab facilities, enabled by investment in proprietary workflows, custom software, robotic automation, and data science and analytics, which is paired with our Codebase, a collection of biological parts and a database of biological data used to program cells. The Cell Engineering segment includes costs incurred for the development, operation, expansion and enhancement of the Foundry and Codebase. Cell Engineering revenue is derived from service fees and downstream value share in the form of milestone payments, royalties or equity interests. 
 Biosecurity: Consists of our end-to-end biomonitoring and bioinformatic support services primarily provided to public health authorities. Biosecurity revenue is derived from fees for data, analytics, and services. Before the fourth quarter of 2023, Biosecurity revenue was also derived from sales of test kits. 
 
 Generating Economic Value Through Cell Programs 
 Our cell programming platform is a key enabling technology and source of intellectual property for our customers products. We earn Cell Engineering revenue for our R D services as well as generally through a share of the value of products created using our platform. 
 We typically structure Cell Engineering revenue to include some combination of the following: 
 service fees, which may comprise cash and/or non-cash consideration, in the form of: 
 upfront payments upon consummation of an agreement or other fixed payments that are generally recognized over our period of performance; 
 reimbursement for costs incurred for R D services; 
 milestone payments upon the achievement of specified technical criteria; 
 plus, when applicable, 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 downstream value share payments in the form of: 
 milestone payments, which may comprise cash and/or non-cash consideration, upon the achievement of specified commercial criteria; 
 royalties on sales of products from or comprising engineered organisms; 
 royalties related to cost of goods sold reductions realized by our customers; 
 or, 
 downstream value share in the form of equity interests in our customer. 
 downstream value share in the form of equity interest appreciation is not recognized as revenue but is expected to contribute to future cash flows upon liquidation, the amount and timing of which is inherently unpredictable. 
 Customer arrangements which involve non-cash consideration generally fall into two categories: Platform Ventures and Structured Partnerships. 
 Platform Ventures 
 Platform Ventures enable Ginkgo to partner with leading multinationals and financial investors to form new ventures in identified market segments with potential to benefit from synthetic biology. In exchange for an equity position in the venture, we contribute license rights to our proprietary cell programming technology and intellectual property, while our partners contribute relevant industry expertise, other resources and venture funding. We also provide R D services for which we receive cash consideration on a fixed-fee or cost-plus basis. Platform Ventures include: 
 Motif FoodWorks, Inc. 
 Founded in 2018, Motif FoodWorks, Inc. Motif was formed to focus on the application of synthetic biology to reduce the reliance on animal products in the food industry. We entered into (i) an Intellectual Property Contribution Agreement IPCA with Motif that granted Motif a license to certain of the our intellectual property and (ii) a Technical Development Agreement TDA that established the terms under which the we provided technical development services. In return for our contribution of intellectual property and access to our platform, we received shares of common stock in Motif. The initial fair value of the common stock investment in Motif was 65.1 million, which has subsequently been reduced to a carrying value of zero as a result of the allocation of losses under the accounting for equity method investments. 
 The initial non-refundable fair value of the equity received, totaling 65.1 million and considered non-cash consideration under ASC 606, was accounted for as material rights under ASC 606. The material rights pertained to Motif's license rights for a set of ingredients that Motif intended for us to develop within the first two years. This amount was recorded as deferred revenue for the future license rights and recognizable as revenue as we performed qualifying services for Motif, or when such rights expire upon termination of the agreements. As of December 31, 2023, we had a remaining deferred revenue balance of 45.4 million with Motif under this arrangement. Effective in August 2024, the Motif IPCA and the TDA agreements were mutually terminated with no adjustment to the original consideration. As a result, we have no further obligation to perform services for Motif and, accordingly, the remaining 45.4 million in deferred revenue under this arrangement has been recognized in full as revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We separately disclose all the non-cash portion of our revenue in the results of operations section below. 
 Allonnia, LLC 
 Founded in 2019, Allonnia, LLC Allonnia was formed to focus on the application of synthetic biology in the waste bioremediation and biorecovery industries. We entered into an intellectual property contribution agreement that granted Allonnia rights to our intellectual property, subject to mutually agreed upon technical development plans. In return for our contribution of intellectual property and access to our platform, we received common units in Allonnia with a right to additional units subject to additional closings of Allonnia s Series A preferred units. The initial fair value of our common units received in Allonnia was 24.5 million, subsequently increased by 12.7 million in 2021, all of which has been reduced to a carrying value of zero as a result of the allocation of losses under our accounting for equity method investments. Allonnia was capitalized through Series A preferred unit financings that raised approximately 52 million in gross proceeds from an investor group which included certain of our investors and Battelle Memorial Institute. In 2023, Allonnia raised an additional 30 million through a Series A extension. Ginkgo also entered into a Technical Development

 Arcaea, LLC 
 Founded in 2021, Arcaea, LLC Arcaea was formed to focus on the application of synthetic biology in the beauty and personal care products industry. In March 2021, we entered into an intellectual property contribution agreement that granted Arcaea rights to our intellectual property, subject to mutually agreed upon technical development plans. In return for our contribution of intellectual property and access to our platform, we received common units in Arcaea with a right to additional units subject to additional closings of Arcaea s Series A preferred units. The initial fair value of our common units received in Arcaea was 11.9 million, which has subsequently been reduced to a carrying value of zero as a result of the allocation of losses under our accounting for equity method investments. Arcaea was capitalized through a Series A preferred unit financing that raised approximately 77 million in gross proceeds from an investor group which included certain of our investors, CHANEL and Givaudan. Upon the closing of the Series A preferred unit financing in July 2021, we received an additional 5.2 million common units in Arcaea. The fair value of our Arcaea common units received in July 2021 of 35.5 million has subsequently been reduced to a carrying value of zero as a result of the allocation of losses under our accounting for equity method investments. Ginkgo also entered into a Technical Development Agreement with Arcaea under which we provide R D services in return for cash consideration on a fixed fee or cost-plus basis. 
 Ayana Bio, LLC 
 Founded in September 2021, Ayana Bio, LLC Ayana was formed to identify and design new bioactive compounds for use as complementary medicine to support human health and wellness. Ayana was capitalized through a Series A funding that raised 30 million in gross proceeds from an investor group comprising certain of our investors.

 Structured Partnerships 
 Structured Partnerships allow Ginkgo to: (i) partner with early stage synthetic biology product companies to adopt our Foundry as their cell programming R D platform, in which we offer flexible commercial terms on the service fees including the ability to pay a portion or all of such upfront fees in the form of non-cash consideration (convertible financial instruments and/or equity securities), in addition to downstream value share consideration Startup Structured Partnership and (ii) partner with existing entities with complementary assets for high potential synthetic biology applications in a large-scale, multi-program collaboration Legacy Structured Partnership ). In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we entered into zero and six, respectively, Startup Structured Partnerships and received prepayments of service fees in the form of equity securities or convertible financial instruments totaling 17.0 million that is recognized as revenue over our period of performance. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not enter into any new Startup Structured Partnerships. Our Legacy Structured Partnerships are described below: 
 Genomatica, Inc. 
 Genomatica, Inc. Genomatica is a biotechnology company specializing in the development and manufacturing of intermediate and specialty chemicals from both sugar and alternative feedstocks. In 2016 and 2018, we acquired preferred stock in Genomatica with an aggregate investment value of 55.0 million in exchange for cash and committed R D services. The carrying value of the investment was 7.0 million as of September 30, 2024, reflective of impairment losses recognized through that date. 
 Synlogic, Inc. 
 Synlogic, Inc. Synlogic is a publicly traded clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing drug discovery and development for synthetic biology-derived medicines.

 See Note 5 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details of our investments in and the material terms of our agreements with our Platform Ventures and Structured Partnerships. 
 
 Key Business Metrics 
 A cell program (or program is the work we do for our customers to enable their product(s) of interest. Programs are defined by a technical development plan or objective. We generally exclude proof-of-concept projects and other exploratory work undertaken on a customer s behalf from the program count. In the near-term, programs typically deliver multi-year revenue from service fees. Over the long-term, program growth drives a physical infrastructure scale economic

 (1) Last twelve months ended September 30, 2024 
 New Programs 
 New Programs represent the number of unique programs commenced within the reporting period. As new programs typically have multi-year durations, we view this metric as an indication of future Cell Engineering revenue growth. 
 Current Active Programs 
 Current Active Programs represent the number of unique programs for which we performed R D services in the reporting period. We view this metric as an indication of current period and future Cell Engineering revenue. 
 Cumulative Programs 
 Cumulative Programs represent the cumulative number of unique programs Ginkgo has commenced. We view this metric as an indication of our competitive advantage and as a leading indicator of the mid- to long-term potential economic value derived from downstream value share arrangements. The cumulative number of programs also contributes to Codebase, which accumulates with each additional program we conduct over time and drives better experimental direction and improves the odds of technical success in current and future programs. 
 We believe the preceding metrics are important to understand our current business. These metrics may change or be substituted for additional or different metrics as our business develops. For example, as our program mix changes, our data gathering abilities expand or our understanding of key business drivers develops, we anticipate updating these metrics or their definitions to reflect such changes. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Cell Engineering Revenue 
 We generate Cell Engineering revenue through the execution of license and collaboration agreements whereby customers obtain license rights to our proprietary technology and intellectual property for use in the development and commercialization of engineered organisms and derived products. Under these agreements, we typically provide R D services for cell programming with the goal of producing an engineered cell that meets a mutually agreed specification. Our customers obtain license rights to the output of our services, which are primarily the optimized strains or cell lines, in order to manufacture and commercialize products derived from that licensed strain or cell line. Generally, the terms of these agreements provide that we receive some combination of: (1) service fees in the form of (i) upfront payments upon consummation of the agreement or other fixed payments, (ii) reimbursement for costs incurred for R D services and (iii) milestone payments upon the achievement of specified technical criteria, plus (2) downstream value share payments in the form of (i) milestone payments upon the achievement of specified commercial criteria, (ii) royalties on sales of products from or comprising engineered organisms arising from the collaboration or licensing agreement and/or (iii) royalties related to cost of goods sold reductions realized by our customers. Royalties did not comprise a material amount of our revenue during any of the periods presented. 
 Cell Engineering revenue includes transactions with Platform Ventures and Legacy Structured Partnerships where, as part of these transactions, we received an equity interest in such entities. Specifically related to the Platform Ventures, in these transactions, we received upfront non-cash consideration in the form of common equity interests in these entities, while the Platform Ventures each received cash equity investments from strategic partners and financial investors. We view the upfront non-cash consideration as prepayments for licenses which will be granted in the future as we complete mutually agreed upon technical development plans. In these instances, we also receive cash consideration for the R D services 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 performed by us on a fixed fee or cost-plus basis. We are not compensated through additional milestone or royalty payments under these arrangements. Our transactions with Genomatica and Synlogic included the purchase of equity securities and the provision of R D services. As we perform R D services under the mutually agreed upon development plans, we recognize a reduction in the prefunded obligation on a cost-plus basis. These arrangements are further described in Notes 5 , 6 , and 14 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Cell Engineering revenue also includes transactions with Startup Structured Partnerships where, as part of these transactions, we received upfront non-cash consideration in the form of current equity interests or financial instruments that are convertible into equity upon a triggering event. We grant the customer a prepaid Cell Engineering services credit in exchange for the upfront non-cash consideration, which can be drawn down as payment for R D services performed under mutually agreed upon development plans. 
 Downstream value share in the form of equity interest appreciation is not recognized as revenue but is expected to contribute to future cash flows upon liquidation, the amount and timing of which is inherently unpredictable. The initial fair market value of the equity interests received may also decrease after contract inception and the amount of cash proceeds eventually realized may be less than the revenue recognized. Equity investments are accounted for under the equity method, cost method or are carried at fair value. 
 Commencing in the second quarter of 2024, we announced changes in commercial terms applicable to some customer contracts, including new intellectual property terms in favor of customers and the removal of downstream value share from certain program types in many circumstances. Our end-to-end Cell Engineering solutions offering is expected to continue to maintain downstream value share. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we launched several new customer offerings, including Ginkgo Datapoints, an artificial intelligence (AI) model application programming interface (API), and lab automation solutions. Ginkgo Datapoints' data generation products provide large, biological datasets for customers to train their AI models. Our model API provides users with access to both publicly available models and Ginkgo s own protein sequence large language model (LLM) trained on Ginkgo s proprietary datasets. Our lab automation solutions combines modular hardware, control software and managed support to provide customers the ability to automate their own lab workflows in house. 
 There has been no material impact on our revenue recognition policies to date from the announced changes in our new commercial terms and Cell Engineering offerings. 
 Biosecurity Revenue 
 We offer biomonitoring and bioinformatic support services internationally as well as domestically. We are currently offering biomonitoring and bioinformatic support services domestically through our partnerships with the CDC and XpresCheck, and internationally through our international programs, including those in Qatar, Rwanda and Ukraine. We are also engaged in a series of smaller partnerships that generate revenues through biosecurity services and R D. 
 We generate service revenue through the sale of our end-to-end biomonitoring and bioinformatic support services. These service offerings generally consist of multiple promised goods and services including, but not limited to, sample collection, sample storage and transportation, outsourced laboratory analysis, access to results reported through a web-based portal, analytical reporting of results, and overall program management. Before the fourth quarter of 2023, we generated product revenue by selling lateral flow assay LFA diagnostic test kits, polymerase chain reaction PCR sample collection kits, and pooled test kits associated with COVID-19 tests to customers on a standalone basis. 
 In general, these agreements stipulate that we are entitled to compensation for service revenue as services are performed and for product revenue upon delivery of diagnostic test kits. The timing of revenue recognition depends on the identified performance obligations but is generally recognized ratably over time or as results are reported to the customer.

 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740 , Income Taxes , which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred tax assets will not be 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 realized. For all periods presented, we have recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized. 
 We account for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors, including, but not limited to, changes in the law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. 
 Income taxes are determined at the applicable tax rates adjusted for non-deductible expenses, R D tax credits and other permanent differences. Our income tax provision may be significantly affected by changes to our estimates.

 Cell Engineering Revenue 
 Cell Engineering revenue increased by 37.9 million and 22.6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the progress of Current Active Programs with existing and new customers, including the recognition of 45.4 million in non-cash revenue from the release of the deferred revenue balance associated with the terminated Motif contract in the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, revenue increased due to the launch of New Programs and was partially offset by the completion of certain programs. 
 As discussed above in Components of Results of Operations, Cell Engineering revenue comprises both cash and non-cash consideration. Cell Engineering revenue recognized relating to non-cash consideration increased from 16.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 48.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and from 46.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 60.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to the recognition of 45.4 million in non-cash revenue from the release of the deferred revenue balance associated with the terminated Motif contract in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower non-cash revenue from other customers. 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, 11 New Programs commenced, compared to 21 New Programs in the same period in 2023. The number of Current Active Programs rose to 136, compared to 116 in the prior year period. Cumulative Programs increased to 280 from 219 over the same period. Additionally, the number of customers grew to 81, up from 76 in the prior year period. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 38 New Programs commenced, compared to 55 New Programs in the same period in 2023. The number of Current Active Programs rose to 162, compared to 139 in the prior year period. Cumulative Programs increased to 280 from 219 over the same period. Additionally, the number of customers grew to 91, up from 84 in the prior year period. 
 While the majority of Cell Engineering revenue today is made up of service fees, as we increase Cumulative Programs and to the extent our customers successfully commercialize products built on our platform, downstream value share is expected to comprise a larger proportion of Cell Engineering revenue. Downstream value share in the form of equity interest appreciation is not recognized as revenue but is expected to contribute to future cash flows upon liquidation of these equity interests, the amount and timing of which is inherently unpredictable. The initial fair market value of the equity interests received may also decrease after contract inception and the amount of cash proceeds eventually realized may be less than the revenue recognized. 
 Biosecurity Revenue 
 Biosecurity revenue decreased 4.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and was comprised of a decrease in product revenue of 6.5 million offset by an increase in service revenue of 2.2 million. 
 Biosecurity revenue decreased 56.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and was comprised of a decrease in product revenue of 28.9 million and a decrease in service revenue of 27.2 million. 
 The decreases in revenue between periods is attributable to the end of our COVID-19 testing in schools in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by new expanded offerings of biomonitoring and bioinformatic support services in the 2024 periods. 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 Since the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency in May 2023, we shifted our Biosecurity business focus to developing scalable biosecurity infrastructure and delivering global surveillance programs and analytics services. Biosecurity revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised of our expanded offerings of biomonitoring and bioinformatic support services. Through our partnerships, we operate programs for collections, testing, sequencing, and insights delivery on pathogen samples in different countries. 
 Cost of Biosecurity Product and Service Revenue 
 Cost of Biosecurity product and service revenue increased 3.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by growth in our expanded offerings of biomonitoring and bioinformatic support services since the conclusion of our COVID-19 testing in schools in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Cost of Biosecurity product and service revenue decreased 16.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was driven by the end of our COVID-19 testing in schools in the third quarter of 2023 and the transition of our Biosecurity business to global surveillance programs and analytic services. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Our research and development expenses principally relate to the development of new offerings and the operation, expansion and enhancement of our existing service offerings utilizing our proprietary platform, which includes our Foundry and Codebase assets, to our cell engineering customers. Our research personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, is our largest expense, aggregating 31.2 million and 152.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 70.5 million and 239.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We also acquired and expensed in-process research and development through the issuance of our equity, aggregating 19.8 million and 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our remaining research and development costs are comprised primarily of rent and related facilities costs, information technology costs, depreciation pertaining to facilities and equipment, laboratory consumables, contract services and routine costs and fees. 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 79.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of 29.7 million (inclusive of employer payroll taxes) and the deconsolidation of our former subsidiary, Zymergen Inc. Zymergen ), in the fourth quarter of 2023 20.5 million). Additionally, there were decreases in lab equipment impairment of 12.3 million, personnel-related compensation and benefits expense of 4.8 million, software and technology expense of 2.9 million, professional fees of 2.8 million, and laboratory supplies of 1.4 million. 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 115.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of 70.4 million (inclusive of employer payroll taxes) and the deconsolidation of Zymergen 50.5 million). Additionally, there were decreases in professional fees of 11.4 million, lab equipment impairment of 12.3 million, and temporary labor and contractors of 2.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in acquired in-process research and development costs of 15.9 million, rent and related facilities costs of 11.4 million, software and technology expense of 6.0 million, laboratory supplies of 3.3 million, and outside service costs of 3.1 million. Increases in research and development expenses supported the growth of Cell Engineering capabilities prior to the commencement of the restructuring. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 29.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the deconsolidation of Zymergen 17.4 million) and a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of 8.7 million (inclusive of employer payroll taxes). Additionally, there were decreases in professional fees of 8.8 million and temporary labor and contractors of 2.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in rent and related facilities costs of 8.3 million from a new facility lease that commenced in the second quarter of 2024. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 106.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the deconsolidation of Zymergen 72.8 million) and a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of 20.7 million (inclusive of employer payroll taxes). Additionally, there were decreases in professional fees of 22.7 million and the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulting from acquisitions of 6.5 million, partially offset by an increase in personnel-related compensation and benefits

 expense of 11.0 million and rent and related facilities costs of 8.3 million from a new facility lease that commenced in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Impairment of Lease Assets 
 In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an impairment loss of 96.2 million related to a right-of-use asset and the associated leasehold improvements for an exited Zymergen leased facility. During the third quarter of 2023, Zymergen ceased use of and vacated the leased space, which triggered an impairment analysis and resulted in a write-down of the carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair value. 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded goodwill impairment expense of 47.9 million related to our Cell Engineering reporting unit, further discussed within Critical Accounting Estimates below. 
 Restructuring Charges 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred restructuring charges of 2.9 million and 20.0 million, respectively, in connection with our restructuring plan announced and commenced in the second quarter of 2024, primarily in the Cell Engineering segment. These charges primarily consisted of employee termination costs from the reduction in force commenced in June 2024 and the impairment of a right-of-use asset relating to facilities consolidation. See Note 3 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details. 
 Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income, net decreased 5.8 million and 12.6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower average cash balances in interest bearing accounts. 
 Loss on Equity Method Investments 
 Loss on equity method investments was zero and 1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. No loss on equity method investments was recognized in 2024. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 1.5 million loss on our equity method investment in BiomEdit, representing our share of the investee s losses under the HLBV method and the fair value of the additional equity we received in BiomEdit of 1.1 million in the first half of 2023, which was reduced to zero during the period as a result of the application of the HLBV method. 
 Under the HLBV method, we absorb losses as a common unit holder prior to preferred unit holders due to a substantive profit-sharing agreement where the preferred unit holders receive preferential distribution rights. Because we have no commitment to fund the losses of our equity method investees, no further losses on these investments were recognized during the periods presented. 
 Loss on Investments 
 Loss on investments was 6.9 million and 36.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 16.3 million and 44.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the 2023 periods, we recorded higher impairment losses on our non-marketable equity securities compared to the comparable 2024 periods. 
 Loss on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a 7.0 million loss on our deconsolidation of our former foreign subsidiary Altar as a result of a sale.

 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 The change in fair value of warrant liabilities was a gain of 1.5 million and 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a gain of 5.7 million and a loss of 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities is primarily driven by fluctuations in the value of our common stock. Increases or decreases in the value of our common stock result in a loss or gain, respectively, in the fair value of warrant liabilities. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net decreased by 1.3 million and 6.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in sublease rent income as a result of the deconsolidation of Zymergen. 
 
 Non-GAAP Information 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions. We believe these non-GAAP measures, when viewed with our GAAP results, may be helpful to investors in assessing our operating performance. 
 We define EBITDA as net loss attributable to Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, Inc. stockholders before the impact of interest income, interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, gain or loss on equity method investments, gain or loss on investments, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, gain or loss on deconsolidation of subsidiaries, transaction and integration costs associated with planned, completed or terminated mergers and acquisitions, including related litigation costs, restructuring and impairment charges (inclusive of impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets), costs associated with the bankruptcy filing of our former subsidiary, Zymergen (the Zymergen Bankruptcy ), and certain other income and expenses. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends because it eliminates the effect of financing activities, investing activities, and certain non-cash charges and other items that are not related to our core operating performance or affect comparability period over period. 
 Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we updated our definition of Adjusted EBITDA to no longer exclude the impact of acquired in-process research and development expenses. The comparable periods in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 have been recast to conform to the revised definition. 
 Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by future income or future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Our computation of these measures, especially Adjusted EBITDA, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because not all companies calculate these measures in the same way. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 On August 19, 2024, with the approval of our board of directors and shareholders, we effected a one-for-forty (1:40) reverse stock split for our common stock. Accordingly, all common shares presented herein have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Upon the closing of our merger with SRNG in September 2021, we received net proceeds totaling approximately 1,509.6 million, inclusive of 760.0 million from investments from certain accredited investors for 1.9 million shares of our Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 616.2 million, which we believe will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations through at least the next 12 months from the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 We anticipate that our expenditures will exceed our revenue through at least the next 12 months from the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as we: 
 continue our R D activities under existing and new programs and further invest in our Foundry and Codebase; 
 develop and expand our offerings, including Biosecurity; 
 upgrade and expand our operational, financial and management systems and support our operations; 
 potentially acquire and integrate companies, assets or intellectual property that advance our company objectives; 
 maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property; and 
 continue our restructuring actions.

The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a 31.1 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to the payment or release of restructuring-related accruals and litigation costs, a 67.8 million decrease in deferred revenue primarily from a one-time release of a deferred revenue balance associated with a terminated customer contract, and a 11.4 million decrease in operating lease liabilities from rent payments, partially offset by a 19.2 million decrease in operating lease right-of-use assets from lease incentives received. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of 47.4 million in depreciation and amortization, 91.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, 16.3 million loss on investments, 20.6 million non-cash lease expense, 19.8 million in acquired in-process research and development expense, and 47.9 million in goodwill impairment.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Except as described below, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Goodwill 
 We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment assessments require a significant amount of management judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions that could have a significant effect on whether or not an impairment charge is recorded and the magnitude of such a charge. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to a sustained decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock and market capitalization, we identified that a possible indicator of impairment was present as of June 30, 2024. As such, we completed a quantitative impairment test related to our Cell Engineering reporting unit. To conduct the impairment test of goodwill, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was compared to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of the Cell Engineering reporting unit was determined using a weighted approach that considered a discounted cash flow DCF model under the income approach and the guideline public company GPC method under the market approach. Inputs used in the DCF model included the projected future operating results of the reporting unit and the applicable discount rate, while inputs used in the GPC method consisted of a revenue multiple. The projected future operating results were based on historical experience and internal annual operating plans reviewed by management, extrapolated over the forecast period. The discount rate was determined using a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk factors specific to the reporting unit. The revenue multiple was based on the GPC method using comparable publicly traded company multiples of revenue for a group of benchmark companies. The DCF method was weighted 75 and the GPC 25 . We reconciled the resulting fair value of the reporting unit to our market capitalization to corroborate the fair value estimate used in the impairment test. 
 The interim impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value. As a result, we fully impaired goodwill and recorded an impairment loss of 47.9 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 1 , Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our cash equivalents are invested in short-term U.S. Treasury obligations. However, because of the short-term nature of the instruments in our portfolio, an immediate change in market interest rates of 100 basis points would not have a material impact on the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents or on our financial position or results of operations. 
 Foreign Currency Fluctuation Risk 
 We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries, whose financial condition and results of operations are reported in their local currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency translation (loss) gain was 0.5 million and (1.6) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and (2.7) million and (0.3) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accounted for as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Additionally, we have contracted with and may continue to contract with foreign vendors. We do not believe that an immediate 10 increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies would have a material effect on operating results or financial condition. 
 Inflation Fluctuation Risk 
 Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor, laboratory supplies, consumables and equipment. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the material weakness previously identified in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 is still present as of September 30, 2024. Based on the material weaknesses, and the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Notwithstanding the identified material weakness, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in conformity with GAAP. 
 
 Remediation of the Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 With oversight of the Audit Committee, we continue to be engaged in remediation efforts to address the material weakness described above and enhance our control environment, including our internal control over financial reporting. We expect to 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 continue remediation efforts during the remainder of fiscal year 2024. In addition, until remediation steps have been completed and are operated for a sufficient period of time, and subsequent evaluation of their effectiveness is completed, the material weakness previously disclosed will continue to exist. Our ongoing remediation efforts include: 
 Continued employee training related to internal control over financial reporting specifically focused on data used in the operation of management review controls and the execution of management review controls with an appropriate level of precision and appropriate documentation of the identification and resolution of follow-up items; 
 Implementation and enhancement of control activities, including automation of certain control processes; and 
 Development of other tools and enablers, including increasing the standardization of control support and documentation. 
 Management and our board of directors are committed to the remediation of the material weakness described above, as well as the continued improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to implement measures to remedy our internal control deficiencies, and we will continue to assess our internal controls and procedures and take further action as necessary or appropriate to address any other matters we identify. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except as otherwise noted above under Remediation of the Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting including the ongoing remediation efforts described, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our plans for remediating the material weakness described above will constitute changes in our internal control over financial reporting when such remediation plans are effectively implemented.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, the Company may in the ordinary course of business be named as a defendant in lawsuits, indemnity claims and other legal proceedings. The Company does not believe any pending litigation to be material, or that the outcome of any such pending litigation, in management s judgment based on information currently available, would have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
 See Note 9 , Commitments and Contingencies, to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our restructuring actions that were publicly announced on May 9, 2024, in connection with the Company s plans to reduce operational expenditures, may not result in anticipated savings, could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected and could disrupt our business. 
 As previously announced on May 9, 2024, in connection with the Company s plans to reduce operational expenditures, management, with the approval of the Board of Directors, approved a restructuring plan, including a reduction in labor expenses and a planned consolidation and sublease of certain facilities. Initial workforce reductions commenced in June 2024 and continued into the third quarter, with further reductions expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025. All reductions are expected to be substantially completed in 2025, subject to compliance with applicable laws. The Company plans to consolidate certain facilities through various actions, including combining office and laboratory operations into fewer locations, subleasing unused facilities, and has taken or plans to take other related measures. While the Company aims to complete the majority of its facility consolidation actions in 2025, the actual timing may vary, especially for subleasing unused or underutilized facilities, which may extend beyond 2025 or may not occur prior to termination of such leases, depending on market conditions. Additionally, restructuring expenses related to potential asset impairments or contract amendments or terminations for any facilities no longer in use or underutilized could be material. The Company currently estimates the costs for the reduction in force to range from 18.0 million to 22.0 million primarily in the Cell Engineering segment and consist of one-time cash severance and related costs. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 On August 5, 2024 and September 23, 2024, we issued a total of 689,550 shares of our Class A common stock to certain former equity holders of FGen AG, valued at approximately 5.4 million, in connection with the achievement of certain milestones, in a private placement transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
