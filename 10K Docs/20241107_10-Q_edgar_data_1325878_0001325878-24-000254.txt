t recognize a provision for credit losses associated with available-for-sale investments or held-to-maturity investments. 
 
 Although certain available-for-sale securities were in an unrealized loss position, these losses are considered temporary as FHLBank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis on these available-for-sale investment securities. FHLBank neither intends to sell these securities nor considers it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before its anticipated recovery of each security's remaining amortized cost basis. 
 
 FHLBank's held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities: (1) were all highly rated and/or had short remaining terms to maturity; (2) had not experienced, nor did FHLBank expect, any payment default on the instruments; (3) in the case of U.S. obligations, carry an explicit government guarantee such that FHLBank considers the risk of nonpayment to be zero; and (4) in the case of GSE debentures or MBS, the securities are purchased under an assumption that the issuers obligation to pay principal and interest on those securities will be honored, taking into account their status as GSEs.

 FHLBank offers advances that may be prepaid without prepayment or termination fees on predetermined exercise dates (call dates) prior to the stated advance maturity (callable advances). In exchange for receiving the right to call the advance on a predetermined call schedule, the borrower may pay a higher rate for the advance relative to an equivalent maturity, non-callable advance. The borrower generally exercises its call options on these advances when interest rates decline (fixed rate advances) or spreads change (adjustable rate advances). FHLBank also offers fixed rate advances that include a put option held by FHLBank (putable advances). On the date FHLBank exercises its put option, the borrower has the option to prepay the advance in full without a fee or roll into another advance product. A putable advance carries a lower interest rate than a comparable-maturity fixed rate advance without the put feature. FHLBank would generally exercise its put option when interest rates increase. Other advances are prepayable with a prepayment fee that makes FHLBank economically indifferent to the prepayment. 
 
 Convertible advances allow FHLBank to convert an advance from one interest payment term structure to another. When issuing convertible advances, FHLBank purchases put options from a member that allow FHLBank to convert the fixed rate advance to a variable rate advance at the current market rate or another structure after an agreed-upon lockout period. A convertible advance carries a lower interest rate than a comparable-maturity fixed rate advance without the conversion feature.

 FHLBank continues to evaluate and make changes to its collateral guidelines, as necessary, based on current market conditions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, advances were past due, on nonaccrual status, or considered impaired. 
 
 Based on the collateral held as security, FHLBank's credit extension and collateral policies, and repayment history on advances, no losses are expected on advances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and therefore allowance for credit losses on advances was recorded.

 allowance for credit losses for government-guaranteed or -insured mortgage loans was recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Furthermore, of these mortgage loans have been placed on nonaccrual status because of the U.S. government guarantee or insurance on these loans and the contractual obligation of the loan servicer to repurchase the loans when certain criteria are met.

 Capital Classification Determination: The FHFA determines each FHLBank s capital classification on at least a quarterly basis. If an FHLBank is determined to be other than adequately capitalized, that FHLBank becomes subject to additional supervisory authority by the FHFA. Before implementing a reclassification, the Director of the FHFA is required to provide an FHLBank with written notice of the proposed action and an opportunity to submit a response. As of the most recent review by the FHFA, FHLBank Topeka was classified as adequately capitalized.

 NOTE 12 
 
 Therefore, the fair values may not be indicative of the amounts that would have been realized in market transactions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Additionally, these values do not represent an estimate of the overall market value of FHLBank as a going concern, which would take into account future business opportunities and the net profitability of assets and liabilities. 
 
 Subjectivity of Estimates: Estimates of the fair value of advances with options, mortgage instruments, and derivatives with embedded options are subjective and require judgments regarding significant matters such as the amount and timing of future cash flows, prepayment speed assumptions, expected interest rate volatility, methods to determine possible distributions of future interest rates used to value options, and the selection of discount rates that appropriately reflect market and credit risks. The use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value estimates. 
 
 Fair Value Hierarchy: The fair value hierarchy requires FHLBank to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The inputs are evaluated and an overall level for the fair value measurement is determined. This overall level is an indication of the market observability of the fair value measurement for the asset or liability. FHLBank must disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the measurements are classified for all assets and liabilities. 
 
 The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels: 
 Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that FHLBank can access on the measurement date. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which the transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
 Level 2 Inputs Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: (1) quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; (2) quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals and implied volatilities); and (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
 Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Valuations are derived from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, which include pricing models, discounted cash flow models using an unobservable discount rate, or similar techniques. 
 
 There were no transfers of assets or liabilities between fair value levels during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Tables 12.1 and 12.2 present the carrying value, fair value and fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. FHLBank records trading securities, available-for-sale securities, derivative assets, and derivative liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and on occasion certain mortgage loans held for portfolio and certain other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. FHLBank measures all other financial assets and liabilities at amortized cost. Further details about the financial assets and liabilities held at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis are presented in Tables 12.3 and 12.4.

 Commitments to issue consolidated bonds, at par 

Commitments to Extend Credit: FHLBank issues standby letters of credit on behalf of its members to support certain obligations of the members to third-party beneficiaries. These standby letters of credit are subject to the same collateralization and borrowing limits that are applicable to advances and are fully collateralized at the time of issuance with assets allowed by FHLBank s Member Products Policy (MPP). Standby letters of credit may be offered to assist members and non-member housing associates in facilitating residential housing finance, community lending, and asset-liability management, and to provide liquidity. In particular, members often use standby letters of credit as collateral for deposits from federal and state government agencies. Standby letters of credit are executed for members for a fee. If FHLBank is required to make payment for a beneficiary's draw, the member either reimburses FHLBank for the amount drawn or, subject to FHLBank's discretion, the amount drawn may be converted into a collateralized advance to the member. However, standby letters of credit usually expire without being drawn upon. FHLBank's current outstanding standby letters of credit expire no later than . Unearned fees as well as the value of the guarantees related to standby letters of credit are recorded in other liabilities and amounted to and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Advance commitments legally bind and unconditionally obligate FHLBank for additional advances up to in the future. Based upon management s credit analysis of members and collateral requirements under the MPP, FHLBank does not expect to incur any credit losses on the outstanding letters of credit or advance commitments. 
 
 Standby Bond-Purchase Agreements: FHLBank has entered into standby bond purchase agreements with state housing authorities whereby FHLBank, for a fee, agrees to purchase and hold the authorities bonds until the designated marketing agent can find a suitable investor or the housing authority repurchases the bond according to a schedule established by the standby agreement. Each standby agreement dictates the specific terms that would require FHLBank to purchase the bond and typically allows FHLBank to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of a default event of the issuer. The bond purchase commitments entered into by FHLBank expire no later than , though some are renewable at the option of FHLBank. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total commitments for bond purchases included agreements with in-district state housing authorities. FHLBank was required to purchase any bonds under any agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Commitments to Purchase Mortgage Loans: These commitments that unconditionally obligate FHLBank to purchase mortgage loans from participating FHLBank Topeka members in the MPF Program are generally for periods not to exceed . Certain commitments are recorded as derivatives at their fair values on the Statements of Condition. FHLBank recorded mortgage delivery commitment net derivative asset balances of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Commitments to Issue Consolidated Obligations: FHLBank enters into commitments to issue consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes outstanding in the normal course of its business. Most settle within the shortest period possible and are considered regular way trades; however, certain commitments are recorded as derivatives at their fair values on the Statements of Condition.

 Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights: 
 Net interest income/margin: Net interest income increased 20.4 million to 135.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 114.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributed to improvements in funding and asset spreads combined with the increase in interest rates, including the impact of higher interest rates on fair value hedges. Net interest margin increased six basis points for the current quarter, from 0.61 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to 0.67 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Net interest spread increased nine basis points, from 0.29 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to 0.38 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Total assets: Total assets increased from 74.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 to 79.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, driven by the 4.7 billion increase in short- and long-term investments between periods and a 1.1 billion decrease in advances. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased 5.3 billion between the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and the same period in the prior year, driven by a 4.1 billion increase in the average balance of short- and long-term investments, a 0.7 billion increase in mortgage loans and a 0.5 billion increase in the average balance of advances. 
 Primary Mission Assets: Advances to members and housing associates and mortgage loans purchased from members are Primary Mission Assets because they are fundamental to the business and mission of FHLBank. The Primary Mission Asset ratio, as defined by the FHFA under its core mission achievement guidance, is calculated as average advances and average mortgage loans to average consolidated obligations (less certain U.S. Treasury securities), based on year-to-date averages. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our Primary Mission Asset ratio was 78 percent and 81 percent, respectively. 
 Advances : Advances decreased to 44.4 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 45.4 billion at December 31, 2023, representing 56.0 percent of total assets as of September 30, 2024, compared to 60.6 percent as of December 31, 2023. The average balance of advances increased 0.5 billion, or 1.0 percent to 46.3 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year period. Advance demand continues to be relatively stable among FHLBank membership, especially among community banks. FHLBank continues to execute its liquidity mission by serving as a reliable source of liquidity and funding for members. 
 Mortgage loans: Mortgage loans increased to 8.9 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 8.4 billion at December 31, 2023, representing 11.2 percent of total assets at September 30, 2024, compared to 11.1 percent at December 31, 2023. The average balance of mortgage loans increased 0.7 billion, or 8.3 percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year period. Interest income was impacted slightly by mortgage loan prepayments and the related premium amortization but continues to be positively impacted by originations at interest rates higher than the weighted average rate of the existing portfolio. 
 Performance ratios: Return on average equity (ROE) increased to 9.9 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.4 percent for the prior year quarter due to the increase in net income for the current quarter, partially offset by the increase in average capital. 
 Dividends: The Class A Common Stock dividend rate of 4.75 percent per annum and the Class B Common Stock dividend rate of 9.50 percent per annum combined for a weighted average dividend rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 of 8.90 percent. 

Financial Market Trends 
 The primary external factors that affect net interest income are market interest rates and the general state of the economy, as discussed in greater detail below.

 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at the September 2024 meeting, indicating that additional adjustments to the target range for the Federal funds rate will depend on incoming data and the balance of inflation and employment risks. The FOMC also indicated it would continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS. 
 
 We issue debt at a spread to U.S. Treasury securities; as a result, the level of interest rates impacts the cost of issuing FHLBank consolidated obligations and the cost of advances to our members and housing associates. The cost of issuing short-term debt has declined with the decrease in market rates, and the continued high demand for short-term Agency debt has kept this spread to the comparable Treasury security relatively narrow. 
 
 Volatility in the capital markets can also impact the demand for and cost of debt issued by the FHLBanks. Efforts of the Federal Reserve Board to ease inflation have contributed to volatility in the financial markets, financial difficulties experienced by some depository institutions, and uncertainties about the economic outlook. For further discussion of FHLBank debt, see this Item 2 Financial Condition Consolidated Obligations. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect our reported results and disclosures. Several of our accounting policies are inherently subject to valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and are more critical than others in terms of their importance to results. Given the assumptions and judgment used, we have identified the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities as a critical accounting estimate. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected under different conditions or different assumptions related to this accounting estimate. 

The accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to an understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are described under Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our annual report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference herein. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Net income increased 9.1 million, or 9.9 percent, to 101.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 92.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income increased 40.4 million, or 14.3 percent, to 323.4 million compared to 283.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income is substantially attributed to the increase in net interest income, partially offset by fair value fluctuations of derivatives and trading securities, increases in operating expenses, and statutory and voluntary contributions to housing and community investment programs. See Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin, and Other Expenses under this Item 2. 
 
 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin: Net interest income increased 20.4 million for the quarter, or 17.8 percent, from 114.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 135.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net interest income increased 68.4 million for the current year-to-date period, from 341.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 409.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Balance sheet composition, market interest rates and trends, and net interest spread affect net interest income and net interest margin on earning assets, including advances, mortgage loans, and investments. The increase for both the three- and nine-month periods was primarily attributed to improvements in funding spreads resulting from the maturities of higher-costing debt during 2024 and shifts in balance sheet composition. Asset spreads also improved, particularly on long-term investments and advances, combined with the impact of higher interest rates on fair value hedges as compared to the prior period. 
 
 Net interest margin increased six basis points for the current quarter, from 0.61 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to 0.67 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (see Table 8). Net interest margin increased eleven basis points, from 0.60 percent to 0.71 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period (see Table 10). Net interest spread increased nine basis points, from 0.29 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to 0.38 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Net interest spread increased eight basis points, from 0.32 percent to 0.40 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The increase in net interest spread was partially due to shifts in balance sheet composition between advances and investments, combined with spread improvements across most asset categories as discussed above. Net interest margin increased as a result of the improvement in net interest spread. For further discussion of advances, investments, mortgage loans, and consolidated obligations, see this Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition.

 Net interest income and net interest margin are also impacted by derivative and hedging activities, as net interest settlements on derivatives and the changes in fair values of hedged assets and liabilities and the corresponding derivative instruments designated in fair value hedging relationships are recorded in net interest income. The increase in net interest income resulting from fair value hedging was driven by the impact of swap index rate increases on net interest settlements between the comparative periods. Tables 4 through 7 present the impact of derivatives and hedging activities recorded in net interest income (in thousands):

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net gains and losses on derivatives resulted in a decrease in net income of 10.4 million compared to an increase of 5.2 million for the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net gains and losses on derivatives resulted in a decrease in net income of 0.2 million compared to an increase of 25.0 million for the prior year period. The change between periods was attributed to fair value fluctuations resulting from changes in the level of swap index rates.

Net Gains (Losses) on Trading Securities: Our trading portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate GSE debentures and fixed rate multifamily GSE MBS, with a small percentage of variable rate single-family GSE MBS. Periodically, we also invest in short-term securities and U.S. Treasury obligations classified as trading. In general, the fixed rate securities are related to economic hedges in the form of interest rate swaps that convert fixed rates to variable rates on the fixed rate securities and the related economic hedges. The fair values of the fixed rate GSE debentures are affected by changes in intermediate term interest rates and credit spreads and are swapped on an economic basis to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The fair values of the fixed rate multifamily GSE MBS are affected by changes in mortgage rates and credit spreads are swapped on an economic basis to SOFR.

 All unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities are recorded in other income (loss) as net gains (losses) on trading securities; however, only gains and losses relating to trading securities that are related to economic hedges are included in Tables 16 and 17. Unrealized gains (losses) fluctuate as the fair value of our trading portfolio fluctuates. There are a number of factors that can impact the fair value of a trading security including the movement in interest rates, changes in credit spreads, the passage of time, and changes in price volatility. Table 18 presents the major components of the net gains (losses) on trading securities (in thousands):

 The unrealized gains on the securities in the trading portfolio for the current periods reflect the changes in term Treasury and mortgage rates relative to the prevailing yields at the end of the prior year periods. In addition to interest rates and credit spreads, the value of these securities is affected by price convergence to par which results in a decrease in their current premium price (i.e., time decay). 

Other Expenses: Other expenses, which includes compensation and benefits, other operating expenses and voluntary housing and community investment program contributions, increased 3.0 million and 10.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase for the current quarter was primarily due to the 1.5 million increase in compensation and benefits. The increase for the nine-month period is primarily a result of a 2.9 million increase in compensation and benefits and 4.6 million in voluntary grant programs awarded in partnership with FHLBank members to support affordable housing and community development initiatives throughout Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. These voluntary contributions are in addition to the statutory Affordable Housing Program (AHP) assessments under the FHLBank Act required to fund affordable housing initiatives. Compensation and benefits increased due to hiring for new and open positions and higher incentive accruals based on incentive plan goal attainment. 
 
 In addition to the ten percent statutory assessment, the FHLBanks have stated in their public comment letter to the FHFA that they are already making or will make voluntary contributions of 5.0 percent of earnings in support of community investment activities. FHLBank has committed at least 2.5 percent of 2023 pre-assessment earnings to voluntary contributions in 2024 and at least 5.0 percent of pre-assessment earnings to voluntary contributions in 2025, plus a gross-up equal to the reduction in the statutory assessment attributable to the voluntary contributions. For 2024, the minimum commitment calculated using 2023 pre-assessment earnings of 414.6 million is 11.8 million. Voluntary housing and community investment program contributions are expensed in the period they are approved by the board of directors and/or awarded, which does not occur ratably throughout the year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we expensed 4.6 million; the remaining amounts will be approved or awarded in the fourth quarter of 2024. For additional information on FHLBank s affordable housing and community development initiatives, refer to Other Mission-Related Activities in Part I, Item 1: Business of FHLBank s 2023 Form 10-K.

Total assets increased between periods, from 74.9 billion at December 31, 2023 to 79.2 billion at September 30, 2024, driven by the 4.7 billion increase in short- and long-term investments between periods, partially offset by a 1.1 billion decrease in advances. Asset composition remained relatively consistent from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, with advances comprising the largest asset on the balance sheet, despite a decrease in advance balances from 60.6 percent of total assets at December 31, 2023 to 56.0 percent at September 30, 2024. Short-term investments increased to 14.2 percent of total assets as of September 30, 2024 compared to 10.1 percent as of December 31, 2023 as a result of FHLBank holding higher balances of liquid assets to ensure adequate liquidity availability for members compared to the end of 2023. Total liabilities increased 4.1 billion from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, which corresponded to the increase in assets, but the composition of debt shifted between periods. Consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes represented 70.3 percent and 29.7 percent of total consolidated obligations, respectively, at December 31, 2023 compared to 76.6 percent and 23.4 percent at September 30, 2024. This composition shift is mostly due to an increase in short-term floating rate bonds and a decrease in discount notes. Total capital increased 0.2 billion, or 4.7 percent, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in retained earnings in excess of dividends paid and an increase in excess capital stock.

 Advances: Advances are one of the primary ways we fulfill our mission of providing liquidity to our members and constituted the largest asset on our balance sheet at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Advance par value decreased by 2.9 percent, from 45.7 billion at December 31, 2023 to 44.4 billion at September 30, 2024 (see Table 21). During the third quarter of 2024, insurance companies and community banks increased advance borrowing, while some large financial institutions replaced advances with other sources of funding. The composition of the advance portfolio remains concentrated in advances that either reprice or mature on a relatively short-term basis; line of credit and adjustable rate advances increased to 53.7 percent of the portfolio at September 30, 2024 compared to 39.0 percent as of December 31, 2023. Within the population of advances that reprice or mature on a relatively short-term basis, composition has shifted from short-term fixed rate advances to adjustable rate advances. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 62.8 percent and 65.1 percent, respectively, of our members carried outstanding advance balances. Advance balances may be impacted by monetary policy changes intended to curb inflationary pressures and the related inflationary effects on member balance sheets, including decreased loan demand and the inability to grow or retain deposit balances. Members also have access to other wholesale funding sources, which may impact the demand for advances on the basis of relative cost. 
 
 We elect to swap a significant portion of advances with longer maturities to short-term indices to synthetically create adjustable rate advances to manage interest rate risk. When coupled with the volume of our short-term fixed rate and adjustable rate advances, advances that effectively re-price at least every three months represent 96.4 percent and 95.9 percent of our total advance portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We anticipate continuing the practice of swapping advances with longer maturities to short-term indices.

MPF Program: The MPF Program is a secondary mortgage market alternative for our members, predominately utilized by the smaller institutions in our district. We participate in the MPF Program through the MPF Provider, a division of FHLBank Chicago. Under the MPF Program, participating members can sell us conventional and government residential mortgage loans. 
 
 The mortgage loan portfolio increased slightly between periods, from 8.4 billion at December 31, 2023 to 8.9 billion at September 30, 2024. Mortgage rates have remained elevated, which has reduced origination volume and refinancing incentive for borrowers and slowed prepayments in recent periods, although purchase volume has continued to exceed principal repayments. As mortgage interest rates decline, we expect an increase in prepayments and new originations of mortgage loans. Net mortgage loans as a percentage of total assets increased, from 11.1 percent as of December 31, 2023 to 11.2 percent as of September 30, 2024. The principal amount of new mortgage loans acquired and held on our balance sheet from our PFIs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.1 billion. 
 
 Future growth in the MPF portfolio is a function of asset size and composition, most notably the balance of advances, and capital level, as growth in advances impacts our total assets and capital level, which allows the balance of mortgage loans to increase while maintaining our targeted Acquired Member Assets (AMA) risk tolerance. The other factors that may influence future growth in our mortgage loans held for portfolio include: (1) the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve; (2) the mortgage loan origination volume of current PFIs; (3) refinancing activity; (4) the relative competitiveness of MPF pricing to the prices offered by other buyers of residential mortgage loans; (5) a PFI's level of excess risk-based capital relative to the required risk-based capital charge associated with the PFI's credit enhancement obligations on MPF mortgage loans; and (6) the number of new and delivering PFIs.

Two indications of credit quality are scores provided by Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. FICO is a widely used credit industry indicator to assess borrower credit quality with scores typically ranging from 300 to 850 with the low end of the scale indicating greater credit risk. The MPF Program requires a minimum FICO score of 620 for all conventional loans. LTV is a primary variable in credit performance. Generally speaking, a higher LTV ratio means greater risk of loss in the event of a default and also means higher loss severity. The weighted average FICO score and LTV recorded at origination for conventional mortgage loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was 750 and 75.0 percent, respectively. See Note 5 of the Notes to Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 for additional information regarding credit quality indicators. 

Allowance for Credit Losses on Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio The allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans decreased 1.3 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Delinquencies of conventional loans remained at low levels relative to the portfolio, at 1.0 percent of the amortized cost of total conventional loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We believe that policies and procedures are in place to effectively manage the credit risk on mortgage loans held for portfolio. See Note 5 of the Notes to Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 for a summary of the allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans as well as payment status and other delinquency statistics for our mortgage loan portfolio. 

Investments: Investments are used to manage interest rate and duration risk, enhance income, and provide liquidity and primary and secondary market support for the U.S. housing securities market. Total investments increased 4.7 billion from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 driven by increases in Federal funds sold, interest bearing deposits, MBS securities, and U.S. treasury obligations. 
 
 Short-term Investments Short-term investments, which are used to provide funds for our members, maintain liquidity, meet other financial obligations such as debt servicing, and enhance income, consist primarily of reverse repurchase agreements, interest-bearing deposits, Federal funds sold, and certificates of deposit. Fluctuations in short-term investments reflect the impact of regulatory requirements, anticipated member liquidity needs, and timing of paydowns, maturities, and investment opportunities on liquidity management practices. At September 30, 2024, the 3.7 billion increase in short-term investments was due to advance paydowns, ensuring adequate liquidity available for members, and the timing of investment opportunities at quarter-end. 
 
 Within our portfolio of short-term investments, counterparty credit risk arises from unsecured exposures. Our short-term unsecured credit investments have maturities generally ranging between overnight and three months and may include the following types: 
 Interest-bearing deposits. Unsecured deposits that earn interest. 
 Federal funds sold. Unsecured loans of reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Banks between financial institutions that are made on either an overnight or term basis, but typically made on an overnight basis. 
 Certificates of deposit. Unsecured negotiable promissory notes issued by banks and payable to the bearer at maturity.

 We actively monitor our credit exposures and the credit quality of our counterparties, including an assessment of each counterparty s financial performance, capital adequacy, sovereign support and the current market perceptions of the counterparties. General macro-economic, political and market conditions may also be considered when deciding on unsecured exposure. As a result, we may further limit existing exposures. 

We manage our credit risk by conducting pre-purchase credit due diligence and ongoing surveillance described previously and generally investing in unsecured investments of highly-rated counterparties. From time to time, we extend unsecured credit to qualified members by investing in overnight Federal funds issued by them. As of September 30, 2024, all unsecured investments were rated as investment grade based on NRSROs (see Table 29).

We also mitigate the credit risk on investments by purchasing instruments that have short-term maturities.

 Unsecured credit exposure continues to be conservatively placed. In addition, we anticipate continued future investment in reverse repurchase agreements, which are secured investments. To enhance our liquidity position, we classify our unsecured short-term investment securities in our trading portfolio, which allows us to sell these securities if necessary.

 Long-term investments Our long-term investment portfolio consists primarily of GSE MBS and U.S. Treasury obligations. Our Risk Management Policy (RMP) restricts the acquisition of investments to highly rated long-term securities. Generally, fixed rate U.S. Treasury obligations are either classified as trading securities and economically swapped to variable rates or classified as available-for-sale securities and swapped to variable rates in qualifying fair value hedging relationships. In addition to serving as excellent collateral, U.S. Treasury obligations also help satisfy regulatory liquidity requirements. We also purchase fixed rate securities for duration and interest rate risk management. 
 
 According to FHFA regulation, no additional MBS purchases may be made if the aggregate value of our MBS exceeds 300 percent of our regulatory capital. Further, quarterly increases in holdings of MBS are restricted to no more than 50 percent of regulatory capital. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate value of our MBS portfolio represented 256 percent of our regulatory capital. We are below our regulatory threshold primarily due to an increase in regulatory capital despite increased MBS purchases in recent periods. We expect to be below our regulatory limit in the near-term but continue to remain opportunistic about future MBS purchases. 

Major Security Types Securities for which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities and recorded at carrying value, which is the net total of par, premiums, and discounts. We classify certain investments as trading or available-for-sale securities and carry them at fair value, generally for liquidity purposes, to provide a fair value offset to the gains (losses) on the interest rate swaps associated with swapped securities, and for asset/liability management purposes. Liquidity or other asset/liability management strategies may require periodic sale of these securities but they are not actively traded; most often, they are held until maturity or call date. Securities acquired as asset/liability management tools to manage duration risk, which may be sold when the duration exposure is within risk tolerances, are classified as trading or available-for-sale securities. Changes in the fair values of investments classified as trading are recorded through other income and the original premiums/discounts on these investments are not amortized.

 See Note 3 of the Notes to Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report for additional information on our different investment classifications including the types of securities held under each classification. The carrying values by contractual maturities of our investments as of September 30, 2024 are summarized by security type in Table 28 (dollar amounts in thousands) with certain weighted average yield metrics along with carrying values as of December 31, 2023. Expected maturities of certain securities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or yield maintenance fees.

 Securities Ratings Tables 29 and 30 present the carrying value of our investments by rating as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands). The ratings presented are the lowest ratings available for the security, issuer, or counterparty based on NRSROs, where available. Some counterparties for collateralized overnight borrowing are not rated by an NRSRO because they are not issuers of debt or are otherwise not required to be rated by an NRSRO. We also utilize other credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments including, but not limited to, collateral performance, marketability, asset class or sector considerations, local and regional economic conditions, and/or the financial health of the underlying issuer.

 Table 31 details interest rate payment terms for the carrying value of our investment securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands). We generally manage the interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate trading and available-for-sale securities by entering into interest rate swaps that convert the investment's fixed rate to a variable rate index (see Tables 37 and 38 under Part I, Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).

Deposits: Deposits are generally an insignificant source of funding. Total deposits increased 133.8 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in demand and overnight deposits. The level of deposits is driven by member demand for deposit products, which in turn is a function of the liquidity position of members. Factors that influence deposit levels include turnover in member investment and loan portfolios, changes in members customer deposit balances, changes in members demand for liquidity, and our deposit pricing as compared to other short-term market rates. Fluctuations in deposits have little impact on our ability to obtain liquidity. Specific disclosures about deposits that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) limits have been omitted as deposits are not insured by the FDIC. Historically, we have had stable and ready access to the capital markets through consolidated obligations and can replace any reduction in deposits with similarly or even lower priced borrowings.

Table of Contents 

 Consolidated Obligations: Consolidated obligations are the joint and several debt obligations of the FHLBanks and consist of bonds and discount notes. Consolidated obligations represent the primary source of liabilities we use to fund advances, mortgage loans and investments. As noted under Part I, Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we use debt with a variety of maturities and option characteristics to manage our interest rate risk profile and maintain sufficient levels of liquidity. We make use of derivative transactions, executed in conjunction with specific consolidated obligation debt issues, to synthetically structure funding terms and costs. 
 
 Table 32 presents the carrying value of consolidated obligation bonds and discounts notes as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands).

 Total consolidated obligations increased 3.9 billion, or 5.6 percent, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 aligning with the increase in total assets. The distribution between consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes shifted between periods, from 70.3 percent and 29.7 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2023 compared to 76.6 percent and 23.4 percent at September 30, 2024, respectively, mostly due to an increase in short-term floating rate bonds and a decrease in discount notes. Callable bonds outstanding declined from 22.9 billion at December 31, 2023 to 16.9 billion at September 30, 2024 primarily due to calls or maturities of swapped callable bonds. Callable bonds are typically fixed or structured rate debt that pay higher coupons to investors because of the optionality held by the issuer. When a swap is called by the counterparty in a swapped callable bond transaction, we call the hedged bond. Unswapped callable bonds provide us with options to replace the bonds at lower costs if interest rates decline. Our funding mix generally is driven by asset composition, but we may also shift our debt composition as a result of market conditions that impact the cost of unswapped consolidated obligations and the cost of consolidated obligations swapped or indexed to SOFR or OIS. For additional information on market trends impacting the cost of issuing debt, see Financial Market Trends , Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Sources of Liquidity and Risk Management Interest Rate Risk Management under this Item 2. 
 
 Derivatives: We use derivatives to reduce the interest-rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. We also use derivatives in our overall interest rate risk management to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of consolidated obligations to approximate more closely the interest rate sensitivity of assets, including advances, investments and mortgage loans. We also use derivatives to manage embedded options in assets and liabilities, to hedge the market value of existing assets, liabilities, and anticipated transactions, to hedge the duration risk of prepayable instruments, to mitigate adverse impacts to earnings from the contraction or extension of certain assets (e.g., advances or mortgage assets) and liabilities, to hedge the basis risk between adjustable-rate indices, and to reduce funding costs as discussed below. Generally, we designate derivatives as a fair value hedge of an underlying financial instrument or firm commitment. Economic hedges are defined as derivatives hedging specific or non-specific underlying assets, liabilities, or firm commitments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, but are acceptable hedging strategies under our RMP for asset/liability management. 
 
 73 

Table of Contents 

 All derivatives are marked to fair value with any associated accrued interest, and netted by clearing agent by Clearinghouse or by counterparty and offset by the fair value of any swap cash collateral received or delivered where the legal right of offset has been determined, and included on the Statements of Condition as an asset when there is a net fair value gain or as a liability when there is a net fair value loss. Fair values of our derivatives primarily fluctuate as the swap interest rate curves fluctuate. Other factors such as implied price/interest rate volatility, the shape of the above interest rate curves and time decay can also drive the market price for derivatives. 
 
 The notional amount of total derivatives outstanding decreased by 1.8 billion, from 51.5 billion at December 31, 2023 to 49.7 billion at September 30, 2024, primarily due to decreases in interest rate swaps hedging callable fixed rate bonds, offset by increases in interest rate swaps hedging non-callable and putable fixed rate advances and interest rate caps purchased to manage duration risk in variable rate investments. For additional information regarding the types of derivative instruments and risks hedged, see Tables 37 and 38 under Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity: We maintain high levels of liquidity to achieve our mission of serving as a dependable and economical funding source for our members and housing associates. As part of fulfilling our mission, we also maintain minimum liquidity requirements in accordance with certain FHFA regulations and guidelines and in accordance with policies established by management and the board of directors. Our business model enables us to manage the levels of our assets, liabilities, and capital in response to changes in member credit demand, membership composition, and market conditions. As such, assets and liabilities utilized for liquidity purposes can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows as a result of these factors. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity A primary source of our liquidity is the issuance of consolidated obligations. The capital markets traditionally have treated FHLBank obligations as U.S. government agency debt. As a result, even though the U.S. government does not guarantee FHLBank debt, we generally have comparatively stable access to funding at relatively favorable spreads to U.S. Treasury rates. We are primarily and directly liable for our portion of consolidated obligations (i.e., those obligations issued on our behalf). In addition, we are jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on the consolidated obligations of all FHLBanks. Our uses of liquidity primarily include repaying called and maturing consolidated obligations for which we are the primary obligor, issuing advances, and purchasing investments and mortgage loans. We also use liquidity to repay member deposits, pledge collateral to derivative counterparties, and redeem or repurchase capital stock. Our other sources of liquidity include our short-term liquidity portfolio, deposit inflows, repayments of advances and mortgage loans, maturing investments, trading and available-for-sale investments, other secured and unsecured borrowings, interest income, or the sale of unencumbered assets. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, proceeds (net of premiums and discounts) from the issuance of bonds and discount notes were 53.4 billion and 462.5 billion, respectively, compared to 39.9 billion and 316.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference between the proceeds from bonds and discount notes reflects the cumulative effect of using short-term discount notes to fund short-term advances and our short-term liquidity portfolio, and the increase between periods reflects the increase in assets. High demand for Agency debt has kept the spread to U.S. Treasury obligations relatively narrow. Our ability to issue debt remains robust, but volatility in the capital markets can impact the demand for and cost of debt issued by the FHLBanks. 
 
 Our short-term liquidity portfolio consists of cash, short-term investments, and long-term investments with remaining maturities of one year or less. Short-term investments may include Federal funds sold, interest-bearing demand deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, and certificates of deposit. The short-term liquidity portfolio increased between periods, from 8.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 to 12.4 billion as of September 30, 2024. The maturities of our short-term investments are structured to provide periodic cash flows to support our ongoing liquidity needs. To enhance our liquidity position, short-term investment securities (i.e., marketable certificates of deposit) are also classified as trading when held so that they can be readily sold should liquidity be needed immediately. 
 
 Investment securities on our balance sheet are also a source of potential liquidity. U.S. Treasury obligations, GSE debentures, and GSE MBS can be sold or pledged as collateral for financing in the securities repurchase agreement market. In addition to balance sheet sources of liquidity, we have established lines of credit with numerous counterparties in the Federal funds market as well as with the other FHLBanks. We expect to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for the foreseeable future. 
 
 74 

Table of Contents 

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, advance disbursements totaled 199.8 billion compared to 661.7 billion for the prior year period which reflects the decrease in member utilization of advances compared to the prior year period, especially short-term advances, due to declines in on-balance sheet liquidity needs, as previously discussed. Investment purchases (excluding overnight investments) totaled 1.8 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.0 billion in the same period in 2023. Payments on maturing and retired consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes were 46.2 billion and 465.9 billion, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 31.4 billion and 323.7 billion for the prior year period. 

Capital: Total capital increased 181.2 million, or 4.7 percent, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 due to an increase in retained earnings in excess of dividends paid and capital stock (see Table 33). We strive to manage our average capital ratio above our minimum regulatory and RMP requirements in an effort to ensure that we have the ability to issue additional consolidated obligations should the need arise. Excess capital capacity ensures we are able to meet the liquidity needs of our members and/or repurchase excess stock either upon the submission of a redemption request by a member or at our discretion for balance sheet or capital management purposes. 

Our activity-based stock purchase requirements are consistent with our cooperative structure; members stock ownership requirements and the dollar amount of dividends paid to members generally increase as their activities with us increase. To the extent that a member s asset-based stock purchase requirement is insufficient to cover the member s activity-based stock purchase requirement, the member is required to purchase Class B Common Stock. We believe the value of our products and services is enhanced by dividend yields. Factors that affect members willingness to enter into activity with us and purchase additional required activity-based stock include, but are not limited to, our dividend rates, the risk-based capital weighting of our capital stock, and alternative investment or borrowing opportunities available to our members. 
 
 Table 33 provides a summary of member capital requirements under our current capital plan as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

 4 Non-members previously required to purchase AMA activity-based stock are subject to the stock requirement in place at the time their membership ended as long as there are unpaid principal balances outstanding. 
 
 We are subject to various capital requirements under provisions of the GLB Act, the FHFA s capital structure regulation and our RMP. See Item 1 Business Capital, Capital Rules and Dividends for details on the various capital requirements. We have been in compliance with each of the capital rules and requirements at all times, as applicable, since the implementation of our capital plan. See Note 10 of the Notes to Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 for additional information and compliance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Capital Distributions: Dividends may be paid in cash or capital stock as authorized by our board of directors. Quarterly dividends can be paid out of current and previous unrestricted retained earnings, subject to FHFA regulation and our capital plan. 
 
 Dividends paid to members totaled 170.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 164.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The weighted average dividend rate was 8.90 percent and 8.82 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which represented a dividend payout ratio of 58.0 percent and 52.7 percent, respectively. The weighted average dividend rate was 8.62 percent and 8.35 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, which represented a dividend payout ratio of 61.4 percent and 58.1 percent, respectively. The dividend payout ratio represents dividends declared and paid during a period as a percentage of net income for the period, although FHFA regulation requires dividends be paid out of known income prior to the declaration date. For example, dividends declared and paid in September 2024 were based on income during the three months ended August 31, 2024. (See Part I, Item 1 Business Capital, Capital Rules and Dividends in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for other factors that contribute to the level of dividends paid.) 

In accordance with our capital plan, we must pay holders of Class A Common Stock the dividend parity threshold (DPT) rate before paying a higher rate to holders of Class B Common Stock. The DPT is a dividend rate expressed as a percentage per annum up to which the dividends paid per share on Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock must be equal. When the overnight Federal funds effective rate is below 2.00 percent, the DPT is zero for that dividend period (DPT is floored at zero). Table 34 presents the dividend rates per annum paid on capital stock under our capital plan for the quarterly periods listed below: 
 
 Table 34 
 Applicable Rate per Annum 09/30/2024 06/30/2024 03/31/2024 12/31/2023 09/30/2023 Class A Common Stock 4.75 4.75 4.75 4.75 4.50 Class B Common Stock 9.50 9.50 9.50 9.50 9.25 Weighted Average 1

 1 Weighted average dividend rates are dividends paid in cash and stock on both classes of stock divided by the average of capital stock eligible for dividends. 

We anticipate that our stock dividends on Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock will remain at or near current dividend rates throughout 2024. Historically, dividend rates have moved directionally with short-term interest rates. Market conditions and movements in short-term interest rates can be unpredictable, and adverse market conditions may result in lower dividend rates in future quarters. If there is a change to the DPT in the future, the capital plan requires that we provide members notice of that change 90 days prior to a dividend payment. 
 
 Under the capital plan, all dividends paid in the form of capital stock must be paid in the form of Class B Common Stock. We expect to continue paying dividends primarily in the form of capital stock, but future dividends may be paid in cash. The payment of cash dividends instead of stock dividends should not have a significant impact from a liquidity perspective, as the subsequent redemption of excess stock created by stock dividends would utilize liquidity resources in the same manner as a cash dividend. FHFA regulation prohibits any FHLBank from paying a stock dividend if excess stock outstanding will exceed one percent of its total assets after payment of the stock dividend. 

Risk Management 
 Active risk management continues to be an essential part of our operations and a key determinant of our ability to maintain earnings to return an acceptable dividend to our members, support our affordable housing mission, and meet retained earnings thresholds. See Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management in our Form 10-K for information on our enterprise risk management program. A separate discussion of market risk is included under Part I, Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Form 10-Q.

 Interest Rate Risk Management: Interest rate risk is the risk that relative and absolute changes in interest rates may adversely affect an institution's financial condition and performance. The goal of an interest rate risk management strategy is not necessarily to eliminate interest rate risk, but to manage it by setting, and operating within, an appropriate framework and limits. We generally manage interest rate risk by acquiring and maintaining a portfolio of assets and liabilities and entering into related derivative transactions to limit the expected mismatches in duration and market value of equity (MVE) sensitivity. See Part I, Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information on interest rate risk measurement.

Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 Significant regulatory actions and developments for the period covered by this report not previously disclosed are summarized below. 
 
 FHFA s Review and Analysis of the FHLBank System. On November 7, 2023, FHFA issued a written report titled FHLBank System at 100: Focusing on the Future, (System at 100 Report) presenting its review and analysis of the FHLBank System and the actions and recommendations it plans to pursue in service of its vision for the future of the FHLBank System. The report focused on four broad themes: (1) the mission of the FHLBank System; (2) the FHLBank System as a stable and reliable source of liquidity; (3) housing and community development; and (4) FHLBank System operational efficiency, structure, and governance. FHFA has stated that it expects to continue a multi-year collaborative effort with the FHLBanks, their member institutions, and other stakeholders to address the recommended actions in the System at 100 Report and has stated that it can implement some of the recommendations from the report through ongoing supervision, guidance, or rulemaking, as well as through statutory changes by proposing specific requests for Congressional action. FHFA made legislative recommendations for the FHLBank System in its 2023 Report to Congress issued on June 14, 2024, consistent with proposed plans and actions included in the System at 100 Report. Other significant recent regulatory actions for the FHLBanks are discussed in this section. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank Member Credit Risk Management. On September 27, 2024, FHFA issued an advisory bulletin setting forth FHFA s expectations that an FHLBank s underwriting and credit decisions should reflect a member s financial condition and not rely solely on the collateral securing the member s credit obligations. The advisory bulletin provides guidance for the FHLBanks to implement policies for credit risk governance, member credit assessment and monitoring of credit conditions, among other considerations. It also provides guidance on the oversight of members in financial distress by recommending implementation of escalation policies, processes for coordination with members prudential regulators, and management policies addressing default, failure, and insolvency situations. FHLBank is evaluating this advisory bulletin versus its current member credit risk management policies and procedures to assess its potential impact on FHLBank and its operations 
 
 Advisory Bulletin on Federal Home Loan Bank System Climate-Related Risk Management . On September 30, 2024, FHFA issued an advisory bulletin setting forth FHFA s expectation that each FHLBank should integrate climate-related risk management into its existing enterprise risk management framework incrementally over time. The advisory bulletin provides that an effective framework should address climate-related risk governance, such as selection of the related risk appetite and setting strategy and objectives, establishing and implementing plans to mitigate and monitor and report material exposures to such risks, and establishing roles and responsibilities for the board of directors and management. The advisory bulletin requires the FHLBanks to establish metrics that track exposure to climate-related risks and collect related data to quantify risk exposures, conduct climate-related scenario analyses, implement processes to report and communicate climate-related risks to internal stakeholders, and have a plan to respond to natural disasters and support climate resiliency. FHLBank is evaluating the potential impact of the advisory bulletin on FHLBank and its operations. 
 
 Proposed Rule on Unsecured Credit Limits for Federal Home Loan Banks. On October 3, 2024, FHFA published a proposed rule with a comment deadline of December 2, 2024 to amend FHFA s regulation on capital requirements (Capital Regulation) to modify unsecured credit limits for FHLBanks. The proposed rule would include interest bearing deposit accounts (IBDAs) in a category of authorized overnight investments that would be excluded from the general limit on unsecured credit to a single counterparty. IBDAs are non-maturity deposits in approved counterparties which may be used to manage liquidity. The proposed rule would, among other things, increase the frequency of the required performance of certain capital calculations and clarify that certain non-interest-bearing deposit accounts (such as settlement, payment or other transactional accounts) are to be considered unsecured extensions of credit subject to the Capital Regulation s unsecured general or overall (less restrictive) limit. Although excluding IBDAs from the general unsecured credit limit could provide greater flexibility for an FHLBank s liquidity management, several of the other proposed changes, if adopted, could result in significant changes to FHLBank s current business processes. FHLBank is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on FHLBank and its operations.

 Proposed Rule on Federal Home Loan Bank System Boards of Directors and Executive Management. On October 21, 2024, FHFA proposed revisions to its regulations addressing boards of directors and overall corporate governance of the FHLBanks and the Office of Finance. The comment deadline will be 90 days after the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. If adopted as presented, the proposed rule would, among other things: (1) impact director compensation by allowing the Director of FHFA to establish an annual amount of director compensation that the Director determines is reasonable; (2) require FHLBank to complete and submit background checks to FHFA on every nominee for a directorship; (3) impact public interest independent director qualifications, in part by requiring a person to have advocated for, or otherwise acted primarily on behalf of or for the direct benefit of, consumers or the community to meet the representation requirement; (4) expand the list of qualifying experiences for all FHLBank independent directors to include artificial intelligence, information technology and security, climate-related risk, Community Development Financial Institutions, business models, and modeling; and (5) establish a review process for director performance and participation, together with a process for removing FHLBank directors for cause. Other proposed revisions address, among other things, FHLBank conflicts of interest policies, covering all FHLBank employees, including specific limitations on executive officers and senior management and record retention. 
 
 While some proposed revisions would codify existing guidance and practice, several of the proposed revisions could result in significant changes to the nomination, election and retention of FHLBank s board of directors. Additional director eligibility requirements and limitations on and potential reductions or limitations to director compensation resulting from the proposed rule could hinder FHLBank s ability to recruit and retain the talent and expertise that are critical to FHLBank s ability to satisfy its mission, particularly given the growing complexities of the finance industry. We continue to analyze the impact that the proposed rule could have on us. 
 
 FHLBank continues to monitor FHFA s efforts to implement the recommendations from the System at 100 Report and FHLBank is not able to predict what actions will ultimately result, the timing or extent of any actions or changes, or the ultimate effect on FHLBank, its members, or the FHLBank System in the future. FHLBank plans to continue to engage with FHFA and other stakeholders in an effort to ensure that the FHLBank System remains well positioned to serve FHLBank s members and their communities. For a further discussion of the System at 100 Report, including proposed plans and actions, and related risks, see, respectively, Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Legislative and Regulatory Developments and Item 1A - Risk Factors, each included in FHLBank s annual report on Form 10-K. 

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market value may adversely affect our financial condition and performance. Interest rate risk is a component of market risk and represents our most significant market risk exposure. Interest rate risk is the risk that the market value of our asset, liability, and derivative portfolios will be negatively impacted by interest rate volatility or that earnings will be affected significantly by interest rate changes. We manage interest rate risk through the characteristics of our portfolio of assets and liabilities and by using derivative transactions to limit duration mismatches and reduce MVE sensitivity. Matching the duration of assets with the duration of liabilities funding those assets is accomplished through the use of different debt maturities and embedded option characteristics, as well as the use of derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, and interest rate floors. Interest rate swaps increase the flexibility of our funding alternatives by providing cash flows or characteristics that might not be as readily available or cost-effective if obtained in the standard GSE debt market. 

Duration of Equity: DOE aggregates the estimated sensitivity of market value for each of our financial assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. A positive DOE results when the duration of assets and designated derivatives is greater than the duration of liabilities and designated derivatives, indicating a degree of interest rate risk exposure in a rising interest rate environment. A negative DOE results in the opposite scenario, indicating a degree of interest rate risk exposure in a declining interest rate environment. Higher DOE numbers, whether positive or negative, indicate greater volatility of market value in response to changing interest rates. A decline in market value does not necessarily translate directly into a decline in income, especially for entities that do not trade financial instruments. Changes in market value may indicate trends in income over longer periods, and knowing the sensitivity of our market value to changes in interest rates provides a measure of the interest rate risk we take. 
 
 Under the RMP, our base case DOE is generally limited to a range of 5.0 assuming current interest rates. In addition, our DOE is generally limited to a range of 7.0 assuming an instantaneous parallel increase or decrease in interest rates of 200 basis points. During periods of extremely low interest rates, the FHFA requires that the FHLBanks employ a constrained down shock analysis to limit the evolution of forward interest rates to positive non-zero values. Since our market risk model imposes a positive non-zero boundary on post-shock interest rates, no additional calculations are necessary to meet this FHFA requirement when applicable. When DOE exceeds the limits established by the RMP, corrective actions taken may include: (1) the purchase of interest rate caps, interest rate floors, or other derivatives; (2) the sale of assets; and/or (3) the addition to the balance sheet of assets or liabilities having characteristics that are such that they counterbalance the excessive duration observed.

Table 35 presents our DOE in the base and the up and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios: 
 
 Table 35 
 Duration of Equity Date Up 200 Basis Points Base Down 200 Basis Points 09/30/2024 2.7 2.5 1.5 06/30/2024 2.7 2.4 1.5 03/31/2024 3.3 2.3 1.3 12/31/2023 3.3 2.1 1.2 09/30/2023 3.2 2.2 1.9 
 
 The primary factors contributing to the net changes in duration from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 were: (1) the relative change in interest rates and the relative level of mortgage rates during the period along with variable rate CMOs and their effective cap levels; (2) the relative percent of total assets represented by the fixed rate mortgage loan portfolio during the period; and (3) asset/liability actions taken by management throughout the period, including the addition of interest rate cap positions. The decrease in interest rates and the relative level of shorter-term interest rates during the period impacted the implied forward rates and the valuation of the variable rate CMO investments with lower effective interest rate caps. To reduce the impact of the general duration lengthening from the variable rate CMO investments with lower effective interest rate caps, stand-alone interest caps were purchased during the period, leading to the continued less asset sensitive DOE level in the +200 interest rate shock scenario. 
 
 In addition, the relative changes in interest rates and mortgage rates during the period caused the mortgage loan portfolio contribution to duration to change marginally less than the associated liabilities, contributing to the increase in the asset sensitive DOE profile in the base case. The mortgage loan portfolio generally has a longer duration profile in the interest rate shock scenarios contributing to the asset-sensitive DOE in the up and down 200 basis point shock scenarios. However, the prepayment sensitivity and market value changes in our mortgage portfolio currently align well with our non-swapped callable debt portfolio in these scenarios generating a relatively stable sensitivity profile in the interest rate shock scenarios. 
 
 The change in interest rates during the period generally shortens the duration profile for both the fixed rate mortgage loan portfolio and the associated unswapped callable consolidated obligation bonds funding these assets. However, the decline in advances during the period generated a marginally larger contribution and an overall modest duration profile change from the mortgage loan and unswapped callable bond portfolios. This behavior is expected since DOE is a market value weighted measure and as portfolio weightings change in relation to total market value of assets, the respective contributions increase or decrease to overall DOE. With the increase in our mortgage loan portfolio balance, the net impact was a slight increase as a percentage of total assets during this period, as discussed in Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition MPF Program so the duration profile changed as expected as prepayments shifted slightly for both new production mortgage loans, as well as the outstanding fixed rate mortgage loan portfolio. 
 
 To effectively manage these changes in the mortgage loan portfolio (including new production and prepaid loans) and related sensitivity to changes in market conditions, unswapped callable consolidated obligation bonds that either matured or were called were generally replaced with reissuance of unswapped callable consolidated obligation bonds with relatively long maturities and short lock-out periods (generally three months to one year). Generally, changes in the profile of the liability portfolio corresponds with the expected duration profile of the fixed rate mortgage loans, all else being equal, and positions the balance sheet for future changes in rates, including changes in interest rate increases where the mortgage loan portfolio will likely lengthen in duration as expected prepayments slow. For further discussion of the call and reissuance of consolidated obligation bonds, see Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Consolidated Obligations. The combination of these factors contributed to the net DOE changes in all scenarios during the period. 
 
 Duration gap is the difference between the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities. Our base duration gap was 1.5 months and 1.3 months for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Market Value of Equity 
 MVE is the net value of our assets and liabilities. Estimating sensitivity of MVE to changes in interest rates is another measure of interest rate risk. The RMP measures our market value risk in terms of the MVE in relation to total regulatory capital stock outstanding (TRCS). TRCS includes all capital stock outstanding, including stock subject to mandatory redemption. As a cooperative, we believe using the TRCS results is an appropriate measure because it reflects our market value relative to the book value of our capital stock. Our RMP stipulates MVE shall not be less than: (1) 100 percent of TRCS under the base case scenario; or (2) 90 percent of TRCS under a 200 basis point instantaneous parallel shock in interest rates. Table 36 presents MVE as a percent of TRCS. As of September 30, 2024, all scenarios are well above the specified limits and much of the relative level in the ratios during the periods covered by the table can be attributed to the relative level of the fixed rate mortgage loan and associated funding portfolio market values along with the relative level of outstanding capital. 
 
 The MVE to TRCS ratios can be impacted by the market value of equity sensitivity and level of capital outstanding based on our capital management approach. The relative level of advance, mortgage loan, and letters of credit balances, which trigger required stock, and excess stock as of September 30, 2024 (see Table 33 under Part I, Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital contributed to the MVE levels as of September 30, 2024. These relationships and associated risk sensitivity primarily generate the changes in the MVE/TRCS levels and produce the changes in the ratios in all interest rate scenarios in the table below. 
 
 Generally, a positive duration position accompanied by rising interest rates would negatively impact the base market value of equity (numerator). Likewise, as capital increases, the MVE/TRCS ratio declines since the capital level is the denominator in the ratio. While the change in interest rates contributed to the overall impact on base MVE during the period, the changes were limited with the ratio maintaining consistent levels in the base case and interest rate shock scenarios during the period.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance in achieving their desired objectives; however, in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 
 Management, with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), our principal executive officer, and the Chief Accounting Officer, our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and Chief Accounting Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
