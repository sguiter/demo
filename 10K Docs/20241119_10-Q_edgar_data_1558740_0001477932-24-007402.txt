Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. The management s discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words believe, plan, intend, anticipate, target, estimate, expect and the like, and/or future tense or conditional constructions will, may, could, should, etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear in our Annual Report on Form 10-K1, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 19, 2024 . Overview Our condensed consolidated financial statements accompanying this Report have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We have a minimal operating history and no revenues or earnings from operations. We have no significant assets or financial resources. We will, in all likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues for the immediate future. On May 16, 2022, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with The Catalyst Group Entertainment, LLC TCG and IQI Media IQI -see Note 1 to the financial statements. Results of Operations for the Nine months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine months Ended September 30, 202 3 Revenue For the Nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 77,340 in revenue compared to 214,978 during the Nine months ended September 30, 2023. We are in the process of developing our strategic business plan going forward and, therefore, revenue may vary from period to period. Operating expenses Operating expenses for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 398,894 compared to 930,720 during the Nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating expenses for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 was -0- compared to 458,040 in non-cash stock-based compensation during the same period in 2023. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in the 2024 period and 2023 period were 398,894 and 472,680, respectively. Excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, the significant decrease in operating expenses in the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is due to the write-down of pre-production license rights of 150,000 in 2023 offset by increases in general and administrative expenses in the 2024 period. Net loss As a result of the foregoing, we had a loss of 101,727 or (0.00) per share for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of 834,203 or (0.00) per share for the Nine months ended September 30, 2023. 18 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We had 289,039 in cash on hand as of September 30, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities was 229,531for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 225,094 for the Nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in operating activities during the Nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the relocation of gain from repurchase of investment to investing activities and changes in assets and liabilities in the 2024 period compared to 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities was 209,533 for the Nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 231,757 for the Nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to proceeds 199,500 and 37,703 from private placements and notes payable-related parties net of 9,000 in repayments of notes payable-related parties, and Loan repayments of 18,670 in 2024, compared to 41,937 in new loans and to 303,556 in proceeds from notes payable-related parties net of its repayment of 113,736 in 2023. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors. Critical Accounting Principles The preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires the Company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results can, and in many cases will, differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting policies. New Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which establishes a new lease accounting model for lessees. The updated guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Codification Improvements, which clarifies certain aspects of the new lease standard. The FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases in July 2018. Also in 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements, which provides an optional transition method whereby the new lease standard is applied at the adoption date and recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings. The amendments have the same effective date and transition requirements as the new lease standard. We adopted ASC 842 on September 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our financial statements because we have no leases. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the sensitivity of income or loss to changes in interest rates, foreign exchanges, commodity prices, equity prices, and other market-driven rates or prices. We are not presently engaged in any substantive commercial business. Accordingly, the risks associated with foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices are not significant. Our debt obligations contain interest rates that are fixed and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 19 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s former management abandoned all operations for many years, and only recently did the Company appoint new management to make filings with the SEC on behalf of the Company. As of September 30, 2024 we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our Company has been dormant since November 2012. As a result, our management did not evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). without such an evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the COSO framework criteria, as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the PCAOB were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (4) complete lack of management of the company from November 2012 until September 30, 2024; and (5) lack of disclosure controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive and Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of September 30, 2024. Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results because the activity during this period was nominal. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside Directors on our Board of Directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the periods ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 20 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
