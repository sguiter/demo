Refer to Note 9 for further discussion on the debt used to finance the Acquisition. Provisional fair value measurements were made for acquired assets and liabilities, and adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods as information necessary to complete the fair value analysis is obtained.

The fair value of customer relationships was estimated using a discounted present value income approach. Under the income approach, an intangible asset s fair value is equal to the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of the asset. Indications of value are developed by discounting future net cash flows to their present value at market-based rates of return. The fair value of the trade names was estimated using an income approach, specifically known as the relief from royalty method. The relief from royalty method is based on the hypothetical royalty stream that would be received if the Company were to license the trade name and was based on expected revenues. The useful life of the customer relationships was determined considering the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible assets adjusted as appropriate for the entity-specific factors including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that may limit the useful life of the customer relationships. The issued equity of the subsidiary, now reflected as noncontrolling interest was valued considering the total value of the acquired company and comparing that to the rollover value of the shares being converted. 14 Table of Contents and , respectively for three months ended September 30, 2024.

(2) The Company identified a timing issue whereby product received by the customer before June 30, 2024 was recorded in July 2024, resulting in an understatement of revenue and cost of good sold in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. (3) Based on an inventory count performed in the third quarter of 2024, management noted the inventory balance at June 30, 2024 was overstated, which results in cost of goods sold being understated. (4) Management over accrued for certain expenses resulting in an overstatement of selling, general and administrative costs in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. (5) Rent expense was properly stated in the three months ended June 30, 2024, but the note was overstated as of June 30, 2024 due to non-cash rent not being recorded in March 2024. 24 Table of Contents Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed in Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere, including Part II, Item 1A, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Risk Factors described in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and our other SEC filings. Company Overview The Company is a specialty agricultural company focused on making and managing its agricultural investments in the United States and internationally. In August 2023, the Company completed the sale of its In-Store Marketing Business for gross proceeds of 3.5 million (See Note 4 in the condensed consolidated financial statements). The operations of the In-Store Marketing Business are presented as discontinued operations. All prior periods presented have been restated to also present the In-Store Marketing Business as discontinued operations. On February 22, 2024, the Company acquired majority ownership in Bloomia B.V. and its subsidiaries Bloomia ). Bloomia produces and sells fresh cut tulips. In April 2023, the Company began the development of a non-bank lending business, through the hiring of a Senior Vice President of Lending, who later became our Chief Executive Officer. The Company met with a number of prospects for loan originations and/or purchases and deals were negotiated, but none reached execution. With the Company s decision to allocate capital to the Bloomia acquisition, significantly less capital was available for the lending business in the near-term. Promptly after receiving a notice of resignation from the Company s then-serving Chief Executive Officer in June 2024, our Board of Directors reexamined the Company s strategic position and prospects. Primarily because the departing Chief Executive Officer represented nearly all of the Company s knowledge and expertise relating to the purchase of existing loans and/or origination and funding of new loans, the Company has determined to focus solely on the ag business. Because the non-bank lending business remained in development, this change is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the Company s operations or financial results. Bloomia Business Bloomia purchases tulip bulbs, hydroponically grows tulips from the bulbs, and sells the stems to retail stores. Bloomia is a leading producer of fresh cut tulips in the United States, nurturing over 75 million stems annually. Net sales (unaudited) of Bloomia for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were approximately 45 million and 43 million, respectively. Bloomia was founded in the Netherlands and is now strategically positioned in the United States, Netherlands, South Africa and Chile. Bloomia has relationships with prominent U.S. mass market retailers. The Company acquired Bloomia for total consideration of 53,360,000. Consideration was comprised of 34,919,000 of cash paid, 15,451,000 of seller bridge loans in lieu of cash, and 2,990,000 of equity issued of Tulp 24.1 which is reflected as noncontrolling interest within these condensed consolidated financial statements. The acquisition was funded through a combination of debt and cash on hand. The tulip sales business tends to be seasonal with spring being the strongest sales season. Accounts receivable and inventory balances are at their lowest levels in the summer following the strong spring sales season. Inventory balances peak prior to the spring season. 25 Table of Contents Former Lending Business The Company had previously planned to also develop a non-bank lending business via its wholly owned subsidiary, Farmland Credit, Inc. FCI ), and FCI s subsidiaries, Farmland Credit FR, LLC and Farmland Credit AV, LLC. Promptly after receiving a notice of resignation from the Company s then-serving Chief Executive Officer in June 2024, our Board of Directors reexamined the Company s strategic position and prospects. Primarily because the now departed Chief Executive Officer represented nearly all the Company s knowledge and expertise relating to the purchase of existing loans and/or origination and funding of new loans, the Company has determined to focus solely on the ag business. Because the non-bank lending business remained in development, this change is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the Company s operations or financial results. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total net sales. Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue, net 6,628,000 - 31,581,000 - Cost of goods sold 5,188,000 - 24,490,000 - Gross profit 1,440,000 - 7,091,000 - Gross profit as a percent of sales 22 NA 22 NA Sales, general and administrative expenses 2,791,000 1,633,000 9,920,000 2,983,000 Operating loss (1,351,000 (1,633,000 (2,829,000 (2,983,000 Operating loss as a percent of sales (20 NA (9 NA Foreign exchange difference, net 46,000 - 10,000 - Interest expense (income), net 800,000 (111,000 1,989,000 (325,000 Other expenses, net (3,000 - (3,000 - Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (2,194,000 (1,522,000 (4,825,000 (2,658,000 Income tax benefit (736,000 (11,000 (1,284,000 (4,000 Net loss from continuing operations (1,458,000 (1,511,000 (3,541,000 (2,654,000 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 66,000 2,637,000 202,000 5,392,000 Net (loss) income including noncontrolling interest (1,392,000 1,126,000 (3,339,000 2,738,000 Less: Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interest (267,000 - (536,000 - Net (loss) income attributable to Lendway, Inc.

Revenue, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6,628,000 and 31,581,000, respectively, all of which were generated from Bloomia for the period from its acquisition on February 22, 2024 the acquisition date through September 30, 2024 (the acquisition period ). The first and second calendar quarters are normally the strongest sales quarters for Bloomia with the first calendar quarter benefiting from Valentine s Day, Easter season and the start of the Spring season. Gross Profit. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,440,000 or 22 as a percentage of revenue. Gross margin percentage is typically higher in the first and second quarters since sales are typically higher and allow better leverage of fixed costs in costs of sales. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 7,091,000. Gross profit as a percentage of total net revenue was 22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The amortization of the inventory written up to fair value was 1,522,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Gross margin percentage has historically been higher in the first and second quarters since sales are typically higher and allow better leverage of fixed costs in costs of sales. 26 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Sales, general and administrative. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,791,000 compared to 1,633,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Bloomia. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 9,920,000 compared to 2,983,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were primarily due to the acquisition of Bloomia, including one-time acquisition-related costs. Interest Expense and Income. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 800,000 compared to interest income of 111,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In connection with the Bloomia acquisition, the Company began incurring interest expenses starting February 21, 2024. The Company did not have debt in the prior year. The Company has not hedged the risk of its interest expense. If the Term SOFR reference rate increases, the Company s interest expense on its term loan and revolving credit facility will increase. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 1,989,000 compared to interest income of 325,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to the interest on the debt associated with the acquisition of Bloomia and less short-term investments in the current year. Income Taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of 33.5 and 26.6 , respectively, on loss from continuing operations. The rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0 due to state taxes of 4.7 , valuation allowance change of 9.3 and nondeductible transaction costs and other permanent items of (8.4) . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of 0.6 and 0.1 , respectively, on loss from continuing operations before income taxes. The rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0 due to state taxes of 3.5 , valuation allowance change of (24.5) . and other permanent items of 0.1 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of 736,000 and 1,284,000, respectively, on the loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in net income of equity investment. The overall benefit of 1,284,000 includes a 451,000 benefit for the reversal of the valuation allowance on federal deferred tax assets. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company established deferred tax liabilities related to the acquisition in the majority ownership of Bloomia. The Company anticipates that the deferred tax liabilities will result in future taxable income that will allow for the realization of the federal deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits totaling 35,000 and 43,000, respectively, including interest, which relates to state nexus issues. The amount of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, that would affect the effective income tax rates of future periods is 35,000. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income from discontinued operations is a result of the reduction in the accrual for sales tax due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects results from operations from the legacy In-store Marketing Business and the 2,970,000 gain from the sale of that business. Information on the sale of the In-Store Marketing Business and statement of operations details of the discontinued operations are included in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Noncontrolling interest . The 18.6 noncontrolling interest in Tulp 24.1 s loss for the acquisition period was 267,000 and 536,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This report includes EBITDA which is a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense. This non-GAAP financial measure, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), has been provided as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure is not a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, respective GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measure presented may differ from similarly named measures used by other companies. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure will be useful to permit investors to evaluate the business consistent with how management evaluates the business. Our EBITDA excludes amounts from net loss from discontinued operations that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance. Management has used EBITDA (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance and trends as well as our performance relative to competitors and peers; (b) to measure operational profitability on a consistent basis; (c) in presentations to the members of our Board of Directors; and (d) to evaluate compliance with covenants and restricted activities under the terms of our Credit Agreement. 27 Table of Contents Included below is a reconciliation of EBITDA to net loss from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

To aid in funding the Bloomia acquisition, Tulp 24.1 entered a Credit Agreement that provided an 18,000,000 term loan and a revolver with borrowings of up to 6,000,000. At September 30, 2024, the Company s working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was 11,520,000 compared to 15,525,000 at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents decreased 14,744,000 from 16,077,000 at December 31, 2023 to 1,333,000 at September 30, 2024. Operating Activities of Continuing Operations . Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,663,000. Cash from operations is greatest in the first half of the year due to the seasonality of the Bloomia business. The Company used approximately 11,000,000 in cash in the period to purchase tulips bulbs. Investing Activities of Continuing Operations . Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 34,682,000, which primarily related to the purchase price and other expenses resulting from the acquisition of Bloomia. Net cash used in investing activities also includes cash received from a note receivable, partially offset by cash paid for purchases of property and equipment. Financing Activities . Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22,473,000, which primarily related to proceeds received from issuance of the Credit Agreement used to fund the acquisition of a majority interest in Bloomia. On February 22, 2024, the Company acquired majority ownership in Bloomia for a total purchase price of 53,360,000. Consideration comprised of 34,919,000 of cash paid, 15,451,000 of seller bridge loans in lieu of cash, and 2,990,000 of equity issued of Tulp 24.1 which is reflected as noncontrolling interest within these condensed consolidated financial statements. The acquisition was funded through a combination of debt and cash on hand. To finance the Bloomia acquisition, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement, together with Tulp 24.1 as the borrower. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, Tulp 24.1 had an 18.0 million term loan funded. The Credit Agreement also contains a 6.0 million revolving credit facility, which may be used by Tulp 24.1 for general business purposes and working capital. On October 16, 2024, the Company amended the credit agreement (Amended Credit Agreement) to, among other things, temporarily increase the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to 8,000,000. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR for an interest period of one month plus 3.0 . In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement, Tulp 24.1 is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50 on the unutilized commitments under the revolving credit facility. 28 Table of Contents The term loans are scheduled to be repaid in quarterly installments of 450,000, commencing on June 30, 2024. The remaining outstanding balance will be repaid in full after five years. The scheduled maturity of the revolving facility is February 20, 2029. The September 2024 installment was paid in October 2024 and is included in the current portion of long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the personal property assets of Tulp 24.1 and its subsidiaries. The Company provided an unsecured guaranty of the obligations of Tulp 24.1 under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement requires Tulp 24.1 and its subsidiaries to maintain (a) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.00 and (b) a maximum senior cash flow leverage ratio of 3.75 to 1.0 until March 31, 2025, and stepping down to 2.00 to 1.00 on December 31, 2027, until the maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of Tulp 24.1 and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of significant assets, make distributions or pay dividends to the Company, make certain investments, including any acquisitions other than permitted acquisitions, make certain payments, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or grant liens on its assets, subject to certain limitations. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the lenders to terminate their commitments and accelerate loans under the Amended Credit Agreement, including failure to make payments under the credit facility, failure to comply with covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement and other loan documents, cross default to other material indebtedness of Tulp 24.1 or any of its subsidiaries, failure of Tulp 24.1 or any of its subsidiaries to pay or discharge material judgments, bankruptcy of Tulp 24.1 or any of its subsidiaries, and change of control of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants and expects to be in compliance for at least the next twelve months. As part of the financing of the Bloomia acquisition, Tulp 24.1 entered into notes payable with the sellers. Notes payable for 12,750,000 million have a term of five years, subject to requiring principal payments based on excess cash flow as defined. Interest is at 8 per annum in the first year and increases annually by 2 percentage points. Notes payable for 2,700,000 million were paid in full as of June 30, 2024. On August 15, 2024, we entered into an unsecured Delayed Draw Term Note (the Note with Air T Inc. Air T pursuant to which Air T has agreed to advance from time to time until August 15, 2026, but not on a revolving basis, up to 2.5 million to fund the Company s operations. Amounts outstanding under the Note will bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.0 , which may be increased by 3.0 upon certain events of default. The entire principal amount outstanding on the Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon as set forth below, shall be due and payable in full on the earlier of (i) August 15, 2029, (ii) Borrow s receipt of a written demand by the Lender delivered on or after February 15, 2026, and (iii) such earlier date as all principal owing hereunder becomes due and payable by acceleration or otherwise (the Maturity Date ). The borrower may prepay any Loan outstanding hereunder, together with accrued and unpaid interest on such Loan, at any time without prepayment or penalty. The Company borrowed 2,000,000 under the note in September 2024. Air T beneficially owns greater than 10 of our outstanding Common Stock and is a member of a group of stockholders that collectively owns approximately 40 of our outstanding common stock. Additionally, our current director and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Mark R. Jundt serves as General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Air T, current director and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Daniel C. Philp serves as Senior Vice President of Corporate development at Air T, and current director Nicholas J. Swenson serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of Air T and is himself a member of the stockholder group. The entry into the Note was approved in advance by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors in accordance with our Related Person Transaction Approval Policy and by a vote of solely independent directors who have no relationship with Air T. The Company expects that cash from operations combined with funds available under the Amended Credit Facility and the Note will provide sufficient credit availability to support its ongoing operations, fund its new debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital for at least the next 12 months. 29 Table of Contents As the Company grows its businesses, we may be required to obtain additional capital through equity offerings or additional debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of those securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include additional covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Additional capital may not be available when needed, on reasonable terms, or at all, and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the U.S. and worldwide. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may not be able to grow our businesses or complete transactions related to the strategy. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. During the preparation of these financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to business combinations, inventory, goodwill, long-lived and indefinite-lived assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. We believe our most critical accounting estimates include the following: Inventory . We coordinate with recurring customers to plan production based on anticipated demand and projections; however, we may have to write down inventory or recognize a material impairment if our production significantly exceeds customer demand. Business Combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, royalty rates and asset lives, among other items. We used the income approach to value certain intangible assets. Under the income approach, an intangible asset s fair value is equal to the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of the asset. The fair value of customer relationships was estimated using a discounted present value income approach. We used the income approach known as the relief from royalty method to value the fair value of the trade name. The relief from royalty method is based on the hypothetical royalty stream that would be received if we were to license the trade name and was based on expected revenues. The determination of the fair value of other assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves assessing factors such as the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and appropriate discount rates at the date of the acquisition. Allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation. During this measurement period, we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings. 30 Table of Contents If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed. We test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level and all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit. Our reporting units are the same as our reporting segments. We test goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test, whereby a goodwill impairment loss will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors, including reporting unit specific operating results and cost factors, as well as industry, market and general economic conditions, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other . Fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using a combination of discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods and multiples of earnings in estimating fair value. The estimate of the reporting unit s fair value is determined by weighing a discounted cash flow model and a market-related model using current industry information that involve significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). In determining the estimated future cash flow, we consider and apply certain estimates and judgments, including current and projected future levels of income based on management s plans, business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions, and market-participant considerations. These assumptions require significant judgment, and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment quantitative assessment ), we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit s carrying value exceeded its fair value. We have an indefinite-lived intangible asset for trade name of 8,570,000 from the Bloomia acquisition. Annually in the fourth quarter, or if conditions indicate an additional review is necessary, we assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a trade name is more likely than not less than its carrying value. If it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred, we then perform the quantitative impairment test. If we perform the quantitative test, the carrying value of the asset is compared to an estimate of its fair value to identify impairment. The fair value is determined by the relief from royalty method, which requires significant judgment. Actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts utilized in the analysis. If we conclude an impairment exists, the asset s carrying value will be written down to its fair value. Long-Lived Assets . Long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and trade name, are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows generated by that asset. These assumptions require significant judgment, and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. In the event the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows generated by that asset and the carrying amount is not considered recoverable, an impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value and is recognized in the statement of income in the period that the impairment occurs. The reasonableness of the useful lives of this asset and other long-lived assets is regularly evaluated. Interest expense. For debt with variable rate interest , interest expense is recorded based on a weighted average effective interest rate method. The significant assumptions used in the weighted average estimate are the future debt balance and the length of time the debt will be outstanding. 31 Table of Contents Income taxes . Deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes, the Company considers tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which it operates, estimates of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies. If tax regulations, operating results or the ability to implement tax-planning strategies vary, adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions, and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. If we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary, the liability will be reversed, and we will recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it is determined the liability no longer applies. Conversely, the Company records additional tax charges in a period in which it is determined that a recorded tax liability is less than the ultimate assessment is expected to be. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from management s estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made in this report that are not statements of historical or current facts are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results or performance of the Company to be materially different from the results or performance expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, future, intend, likely, may, plan, project, will and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements expressing the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company and members of our management team regarding, for instance: (i) our belief that our cash balance, cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our Credit Agreement, will provide adequate liquidity and capital resources for at least the next twelve months, and (ii) regarding the potential for growth and other opportunities for our businesses. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current information, which we have assessed and which by its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Factors that could cause our estimates and assumptions as to future performance, and our actual results, to differ materially include the following: (1) our ability to integrate and continue to successfully operate the newly acquired Bloomia business, (2) our ability to compete, (3) concentration of Bloomia s historical revenue among a small number of customers, (4) changes in interest rates, (5) ability to comply with the requirements of the Credit Agreement, (6) market conditions that may restrict or delay appropriate or desirable opportunities, (7) our ability to develop and maintain necessary processes and controls relating to our businesses (8) reliance on one or a small number of employees in each of our businesses, (9) potential adverse classifications of our Company if we are unsuccessful in executing our business plans, (10) other economic, business, market, financial, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting the Company s businesses generally; (11) our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, operational and sales personnel; and (12) the availability of additional capital on desirable terms, if at all. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set forth in this report and additional risks, if any, identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, this and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s filings with the SEC. Lendway assumes no responsibility to update the forward-looking statements contained in this report or the reasons why actual results would differ from those anticipated in any such forward-looking statement, other than as required by law. 32 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure pursuant to this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and its principal accounting officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, Dan Philp and Mark Jundt, principal executive officers and Biz McShane, principal accounting and financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the year, we completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Bloomia B.V. Bloomia which represents a material change in internal control over financial reporting since management s last assessment. Prior to the acquisition, Bloomia was a private company and has not been subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules and regulations of the SEC, or other corporate governance requirements to which public reporting companies may be subject. As part of our ongoing integration activities, we are continuing to incorporate our controls and procedures into the acquired Bloomia subsidiaries and to augment our company-wide controls to reflect the risks inherent in an acquisition of this type. Other than the Bloomia acquisition, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the first nine months of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 33 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings A description of our legal proceedings, if any, is contained in Note 12 of the Notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, incorporated herein by reference. Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as noted below. The Company s success depends on its key personnel. The Company s business results depend largely upon the continued contributions of Bloomia s CEO Werner Jansen. If Mr. Jansen no longer serves in (or serves in some lesser capacity than) his current role, or if the Company loses other members of our management team, we may not be able to successfully execute on our business strategy and our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the market price of its securities, could be adversely affected. If we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, then we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations, reporting, and compliance. Any internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Given the limited current number of employees, this resource constraint causes challenges in effectively providing appropriate segregation of duties. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over business processes and financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. As a smaller reporting company, the Company is not required to have an attestation from its external auditor on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. With regards to its February 2024 acquisition of Bloomia, the Company intends to elect the provision under SOX to exclude the evaluation of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures for Bloomia for a one-year period after the acquisition date. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2024, the Company has experienced significant challenges completing required SEC filings in the time allotted or has relied on extensions. The delays were primarily caused by acquisition-related integration issues. While the Company has taken steps to address the issue, including hiring a new Chief Financial Officer, we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will prevent or avoid potential future delays in filings or material weaknesses. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, and our ability to access the capital markets could be limited. 34 Table of Contents Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Share Repurchases On August 28, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase authorization providing for the repurchase of up to 400,000 shares of the Company s common stock. We may purchase shares of our common stock from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transaction, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. Open market repurchases may be effected pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of its common stock or to acquire shares on any particular timetable and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company s discretion. There was no repurchase activity for the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 315,792 shares remained available for repurchase under the existing authorization. Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K. 35 Table of Contents Item 6.
