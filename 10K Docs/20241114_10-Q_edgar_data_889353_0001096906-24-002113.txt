Leases are classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations. In addition, a lessor is required to classify leases as either sales-type, financing or operating. A lease will be treated as a sale if it transfers all of the risks and rewards, as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee. If risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control, the lease is treated as financing. If the lessor does not convey risk and rewards or control, the lease is treated as operating. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the lease in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities at commencement are initially measured at the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement to determine the present value of lease payments except when an implicit interest rate is readily determinable.

The terms JMTM, we, us, our, and the Company refer to James Maritime Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation. Business Overview James Maritime Holdings, Inc. operates mainly through its subsidiaries, Gladiator and USS. Gladiator specializes in the distribution of personal protective products, largely through mail-in orders and e-commerce channels. On the other hand, USS offers a combination of professional security personnel services, enhanced by smartphone-based security applications, providing a unique blend of traditional and modern security solutions. The consolidated financial statements were prepared according to U.S. GAAP and SEC regulations. The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year-end for financial statement reporting. The financial statements were prepared with estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates were used for inventories, impairment of long-term assets, and derivatives. The actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Business combinations were accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets, liabilities, and any remaining non-controlling interests were recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests, was recognized as goodwill. The company considers investments with an original maturity of three and six months or less at the purchase date as cash and cash equivalents. Recent Developments During the past two fiscal years, the company underwent significant corporate changes. Share Exchange Agreements and Stock Conversions James Maritime solidified its position in the market by becoming the majority shareholder of Gladiator Solutions Inc., holding approximately 86.7 of all shares outstanding as of December 13, 2021. The acquisition of Gladiator Solutions, Inc. resulted in the issuance of 866,667 shares and brought the total common stock balance to 7,354,129 by the end of 2021. Furthermore, on September 23, 2022, the company fortified its portfolio by completing a share exchange agreement with USS, resulting in James Maritime securing 100 of all USS shares. The acquisition of USS resulted in the issuance of 1,000,000 shares by the end of 2022, and the common stock balance reached 9,004,129. Additional paid-in capital also saw a significant increase to 13,656,447, reflecting the stock issuances and compensations during the year. There were multiple issuances of common stock for diverse purposes, ranging from shareholder-related issuances to share-based compensations and acquisitions. In 2021, our preferred stock decreased from 2,000,000 to 400,000 shares. This decrease was primarily due to the conversion of preferred stock to common stock. Specifically, 1,600,000 shares of preferred stock were converted, leading to the issuance of 750,000 shares of common stock. Total shareholders' equity, which includes both equity attributable to the company and non-controlling interest, increased from 419,248 at the end of 2021 to 2,182,693 by the end of 2022. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMER 30, 2023 Sales - net We had net sales of 989,486 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2,382,896 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1,393,410.

Critical Accounting Policies Please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for disclosures regarding the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates, as well as updates further disclosed in our interim financial statements as described in this Form 10-Q. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Changes to accounting principles are established by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates ASU s to the FASB s Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of all ASU s on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders equity, cash flows, or presentation thereof. Management has evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued through the date these financial statements were available to be issued and found no recent accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures ASU 2022-02 ), which eliminates the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") for creditors in ASC 310, Receivables (Topic 310), and requires entities to provide disclosures about current period gross write-offs by year of origination. Also, ASU 2022-02 updates the requirements related to accounting for credit losses under ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), and adds enhanced disclosures for creditors with respect to loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-07 - Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact this will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ). ASU 2023-09 includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, on either a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. There are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Off-Balance Sheet Transactions At September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. 39 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item 3. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, management performed, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Due to resource constraints, material weaknesses are evident to management regarding our inability to generate all the necessary disclosure for inclusion in our filings with the Securities and Exchanges Commission, which is due to the lack of resources and segregation of duties. We lack sufficient personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in GAAP to meet the demands for a public company, including the accounting skills and understanding necessary to fulfill the requirements of GAAP-based reporting. This weakness causes us to not fully identify and resolve accounting and disclosure issues that could lead to a failure to perform timely internal control and reviews. In addition, the Company has not established an audit committee, does not have any independent outside directors on the Company s Board of Directors, and lacks documentation of its internal control processes. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The key internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management s review and approval of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal controls and procedures over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of these controls. Based on this assessment, specifically that the Company lacks sufficient personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in GAAP to meet the demands for a public company, including the accounting skills and understanding necessary to fulfill the requirements of GAAP-based reporting. This weakness causes us to not fully identify and resolve accounting and disclosure issues that could lead to a failure to perform timely internal control and reviews. In addition, the Company has not established an audit committee, does not have any independent outside directors on the Company s Board of Directors, and lacks documentation of its internal control processes, management has concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 40 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
