Unrealized losses on corporate bonds available for sale are not considered to be credit losses because the bonds are of high credit quality, management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value was largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. At September 30, 2024 , 100 of the mortgage-backed securities were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, primarily FNMA and FHLMC, institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. There were 34 securities in a l oss position at September 30, 2024 . Because the decline in fair value was attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and because the Bank does not have the intent to sell these mortgage-backed securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery, the Bank does not consider these losses to be credit-related at September 30, 2024 . As of September 30, 2024 , allowance for credit loss ("ACL") was required on available for sale securities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , securities available for sale with a carrying valu e of and were pledged to secure public deposits.

Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 The Bank categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Bank analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. Commercial and multi-family real estate, commercial and industrial and construction loans are graded on an annual basis. Residential and consumer loans are primarily evaluated based on performance. Refer to the immediately preceding table for the aging of the recorded investment of these loan segments. The Bank uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 
 Special Mention Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 
 
 Substandard Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 Loans not meeting the criteria above are considered to be Pass rated loans.

The Company generally applies hedge accounting to its derivatives used for market risk management purposes. Hedge accounting is permitted only if specific criteria are met, including a requirement that a highly effective relationship exists between the derivative instrument and the hedged item, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Changes in the fair value of effective fair value hedges are recognized in current earnings (with the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability also recognized in earnings). Changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. Ineffective portions of hedge results are recognized in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied are recognized in current earnings. 
 
 The Company formally documents at inception all relationships between the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities, or to specific firm commitments. The Company also formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Gains or losses resulting from the termination of a derivative accounted for as a cash flow hedge remain in other comprehensive income (loss) and is (accreted) amortized to earnings over the remaining period of the former hedging relationship. 
 
 Certain derivative financial instruments are offered to certain commercial banking customers to manage their risk of exposure and risk management strategies. These derivative instruments consist primarily of currency forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. The risk associated with these transactions is mitigated by simultaneously entering into similar transactions having essentially offsetting terms with a third party, i.e. back-to-back swaps. In addition, the Company executes interest rate swaps with third parties in order to hedge the interest rate risk of short-term FHLB advances. 
 
 Interest Rate Swaps. At September 30, 2024 , the Company had five cash flow interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million hedging certain FHLB advances and brokered deposits. The Company also had fair value interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million hedging certain fixed-rate residential loans. These interest rate swaps meet the hedge accounting requirements. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in comprehensive income. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. The fair value hedges are recorded as components of other assets and other liabilities on the Company s consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in fair value of the fair value hedges are recorded against the basis of the asset or liability being hedged. The gain or loss on these derivatives, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in interest income in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 At December 31, 2023 , the Company had two interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million to hedge certain FHLB advances and brokered deposits. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had no back-to-back interest rate swaps in place with commercial banking customers. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the net effect on interest expense related to cash flow hedges was a reduced expense of and , respectively, while the net effect on interest expense related to fair value hedge during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was a reduced expense of and , respectively.

 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 
 Total Assets. Assets increased 39.6 million, or 4.2 , from 939.3 million at December 31, 2023 to 978.9 million at September 30, 2024 primarily due to a 39.7 million, or 57.6 , increase in securities available for sale and an 7.4 million, or 10.3 , increase in securities held-to-maturity, offset by a 5.8 million, or 0.8 , decrease in loans and a 3.9 million, or 15.8 , decrease in cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased 3.9 million, or 15.8 , to 21.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 24.9 million at December 31, 2023 , as excess funds from increases in borrowings and deposits were used to purchase securities. 
 
 Securities Available for Sale. Securities available for sale increased 39.7 million, or 57.6 , to 108.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 68.9 million at December 31, 2023 . The increase was primarily due to the purchase of mortgage-backed securities that were purchased with excess funds as part of our leveraging strategy. 
 
 Securities Held to Maturity. Securities held to maturity increased 7.4 million, or 10.3 , to 80.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 72.7 million at December 31, 2023 , primarily due to the purchase of mortgage-backed securities with excess funds. At September 30, 2024 , the Company's allowance for credit losses related to held-to-maturity securities totaled 108,000 or 0.13 of the total held-to-maturity securities portfolio. 
 
 Net Loans. Net loans decreased 5.8 million, or 0.8 , to 708.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 714.7 million at December 31, 2023 . The decrease was due to a decrease of 12.6 million, or 2.6 , in one- to four-residential real estate loans to 473.5 million from 486.1 million at December 31, 2023 and a decrease of 9.1 million, or 18.4 , in construction loans to 40.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 49.3 million at December 31, 2023 , offset by a 13.1 million, or 13.1 , increase in commercial real estate loans to 112.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 99.8 million at December 31, 2023 , and by a 3.6 million, or 53.6 , increase in commercial and industrial loans to 10.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 6.7 million at December 31, 2023 . The decreases in one- to four-residential and construction loans reflect less opportunities and decreased demand due to the higher interest rate environment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Bank had no loans held for sale. 
 
 Delinquent loans increased 8.9 million to 21.5 million, or 3.0 of total loans, at September 30, 2024 . The increase was mostly due to four commercial real estate loans to three customers with a balance of 8.1 million. Three of the past due commercial real estate loans are being actively managed with the customers and are expected to be brought current, while one totaling 758,000 has been placed on nonaccrual status, but is considered well-secured with a loan-to-value of 59 . We did not record any specific reserves, or charge-offs for these loans. During the same timeframe, non-performing assets increased from 12.8 million at December 31, 2023 to 13.8 million, which represented 1.41 of total assets at September 30, 2024 . The Company s allowance for credit losses was 0.39 of total loans and 19.94 of non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.39 of total loans and 21.81 of non-performing loans at December 31, 2023 . The Bank does not have any exposure to commercial real estate loans secured by office space. The majority of the non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 was comprised of one construction loan for construction of a catering hall that is 99 complete, with a balance of 10.9 million and a loan to value ratio of 45 . Based on the well-secured nature of the loan, there was no associated specific reserve at September 30, 2024 . The Company has commenced legal action against the client. 
 
 Total Liabilities. Total liabilities increased 39.7 million, or 5.0 , to 841.9 million as of September 30, 2024 from 802.2 million as of December 31, 2023 , primarily due to a 3.9 million increase in deposits and a 34.9 million increase in borrowings.

Table of Contents 

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. Changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionally based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 General. Net income decreased by 338,000 to a net loss of 367,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from a net loss of 29,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 560,000 in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease of 56,000 in non-interest expense, an increase of 128,000 in income tax benefit and a 38,000 increase in non-interest income. 
 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased 1.3 million, or 14.3 , from 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher yields on interest-earning assets and an increase in the average balance of securities. 
 
 Interest income on cash and cash equivalents decreased 30,000, or 17.9 , to 138,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 168,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a 2.6 million decrease in the average balance to 10.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , reflecting the use of excess cash to purchase securities. The decrease was offset by an 18 basis point increase in the average yield from 5.21 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.39 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , due to the higher interest rate environment. 
 
 Interest income on loans increased 400,000, or 5.0 , to 8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to a 24 basis point increase in the average yield from 4.45 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.69 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , and to a lesser extent, a 876,000 increase in the average balance to 711.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 710.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Interest income on securities increased 889,000, or 88.2 , to 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 48.7 million increase in the average balance to 187.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 138.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , and a 114 basis point increase in the average yield from 2.91 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.05 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the higher interest rate environment. 
 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 1.9 million, or 31.1 , from 6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher costs and average balances on interest-bearing liabilities. 
 
 Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased 1.3 million, or 27.0 , to 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was due to a 93 basis point increase in the average cost of deposits to 4.04 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in the average cost of deposits was due to the higher interest rate environment and a change in the composition of the deposit portfolio to a greater concentration of higher-costing certificates of deposit. The average balances of certificates of deposit decreased 831,000 to 497.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 498.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The average balance of savings accounts decreased by 2.1 million during the quarter, while the average balance of NOW and money market accounts decreased 9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Interest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased 582,000, or 47.7 , from 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . The increase was due to an increase in the average balance of 71.6 million to 196.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . The increase was offset by a 22 basis point decrease in the average cost of borrowings to 3.64 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.86 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the new borrowings being at lower rates. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased 560,000, or 17.4 , to 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease reflected a 35 basis point decrease in our net interest rate spread to 0.66 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.01 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Our net interest margin decreased 32 basis points to 1.15 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.47 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses. We did not record a provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023 due to the decrease in loans. 
 
 Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased by 37,000, or 13.0 , to 327,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 290,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Bank-owned life insurance income increased 23,000, or 11.7 , due to higher balances during 2024 , and gain on sale of loans increased 12,000 compared to no gain on sale of loans for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Non-Interest Expense. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , non-interest expense decreased 56,000, or 1.5 , over the comparable 2023 period. This was due to a 171,000, or 7.5 reduction in salaries and employee benefits, which decreased due to lower headcount, and a 40,000, or 31.9 , decrease in advertising expenses. Our FDIC insurance assessment also decreased by 26,000, or 19.8 . These decreases were offset by an increase in professional fees of 99,000, or 70.6 , due to higher consulting expense related to strategic business planning. Data processing expense also increased 100,000, or 48.8 , due to higher processing costs. 
 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax benefit increased 128,000, or 102.1 , to a benefit of 253,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from a 125,000 benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease was due to 466,000 of lower taxable income.

 Interest income on securities increased 2.2 million, or 69.4 , to 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 112 basis point increase in the average yield from 2.80 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and a 31.0 million increase in the average balance to 179.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 148.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 7.4 million, or 47.4 , from 15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 23.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to higher costs and higher average balances on certificates of deposit and borrowings. 
 
 Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased 5.6 million, or 43.9 , to 18.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was due to a 128 basis point increase in the average cost of deposits to 3.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in the average cost of deposits was due to the higher interest rate environment and a change in the composition of the deposit portfolio to a greater concentration of higher-costing certificates of deposit. The average balances of certificates of deposit increased 12.0 million to 510.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 498.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 while average NOW and money market accounts and savings accounts decreased 24.2 million and 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

Management of Market Risk 
 
 General. The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of loans and securities, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our board of directors has established an Asset/Liability Management Committee (the ALCO ), which is comprised of three members of executive management and two independent directors, which oversees the asset/liability management processes and related procedures. The ALCO meets on at least a quarterly basis and reviews asset/liability strategies, liquidity positions, alternative funding sources, interest rate risk measurement reports, capital levels and economic trends at both national and local levels. Our interest rate risk position is also monitored quarterly by the board of directors. 
 
 We manage our interest rate risk to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in market interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: originating and purchasing loans with adjustable interest rates; promoting core deposit products; monitoring the length of our borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank and brokered deposits depending on the interest rate environment; maintaining a majority of our investments as available-for-sale; diversifying our loan portfolio; and strengthening our capital position. By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to changes in market interest rates. 
 
 Net Portfolio Value Simulation. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net portfolio value of equity NPV model. NPV represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities, adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio represents the dollar amount of our NPV divided by the present value of our total assets for a given interest rate scenario. NPV attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology while the NPV ratio reflects that value as a form of capital ratio. We estimate what our NPV would be at a specific date. We then calculate what the NPV would be at the same date throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve. We currently calculate NPV under the assumptions that interest rates increase 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points from current market rates and that interest rates decrease 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points from current market rates. 
 
 The following table presents the estimated changes in our net portfolio value that would result from changes in market interest rates as of September 30, 2024 . All estimated changes presented in the table are within the policy limits approved by the board of directors.

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The table above assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the date indicated remains constant uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our NPV and will differ from actual results. 
 
 Net Interest Income Analysis. We also use income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet at a given point in time by showing the effect on net interest income over specified time frames and using different interest rate shocks and ramps. The assumptions include management s best assessment of the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities, projections for account balances in each of the product lines offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates. These assumptions are subject to change, and as a result, the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in the balance sheet composition and market conditions. Assumptions are supported with quarterly back testing of the model to actual market rate shifts.

 The calculated change in net interest income assumes an instantaneous parallel shift of the yield curve. 

The preceding simulation analyses do not represent a forecast of actual results and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions, which are subject to change, including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels, including the yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows, and others. Also, as market conditions vary, prepayment/refinancing levels, the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps and floors embedded in adjustable-rate loans, early withdrawal of deposits, changes in product preferences, and other internal/external variables will likely deviate from those assumed. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity. Liquidity describes our ability to meet financi al obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities and proceeds from calls, maturities and sales of securities and sales of loans. We also borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. At September 30, 2024 , we had the ability to borrow up to 297.9 million, of which 202.7 million was outstanding and 1.2 million was utilized as collateral for letters of credit issued to secure municipal deposits. At September 30, 2024 , we had 54.0 million in unsecured lines of credit with four correspondent banks with no outstanding balance. 
 
 The board of directors is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and st rategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we had ample sources of liquidity to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any period. At September 30, 2024 , cash and cash equivalents totaled 21.0 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled 108.6 million at September 30, 2024 . 
 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024 t otaled 439.7 million, or 69.9 of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. 
 
 Capital Resources. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At September 30, 2024 , we exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and were considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. As a result of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relie f, and Consumer Protection Act, as modified in April 2020, the federal banking agencies were required to develop a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (the ratio of a bank's Tier 1 equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with less than 10 billion. A qualifying community bank with capital exceeding 9 will be considered compliant with all applicable regulatory capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered "well capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. As of September 30, 2024 , the Bank is reporting as a qualifying community bank with a ratio of 13.12 . 
 
 Inflation 
 
 Substantially all of the Company's assets and liabilities relate to banking activities and are monetary. The consolidated financial statements and related financial data are presented in accordance with GAAP. GAAP currently requires the Company to measure the financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars, except for securities available for sale, impaired loans, and other real estate loans that are measured at fair value. Changes in the value of money due to inflation can cause purchasing power loss. Management's opinion is that movements in interest rates affect the financial condition and results of operations to a greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation. It should be noted that interest rates and inflation do affect each other but do not always move in correlation with each other. The Company's ability to match the interest sensitivity of its financial assets to the interest sensitivity of its liabilities in its asset/liability management may tend to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates on the Company's performance.

 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of September 30, 2024 was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024 were not effective due to the previously reported material weakness described below. 
 
 Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 During May 2024, while finalizing the unaudited interim financial statements, it was discovered that the accounting for fair value hedges was completed incorrectly in that instead of adjusting the fair value of loans the accumulated other comprehensive loss was adjusted. As such, the Company concluded that a material weakness existed in its internal controls over financial reporting. The fair value hedges were purchased in February 2024 and the error was discovered before any financial statements were issued. Corrections were made to properly reflect the correct accounting treatments of fair value hedges. Consequently, the material weakness did not result in any identified misstatement, and there were no changes to previously issued financial statements. 
 
 Remediation Plan for the Material Weakness 
 
 In the first quarter of 2024, corrections were made by management to properly account for the fair value hedges, which completely remedied the material weakness. Management will continue to account for the fair value hedges in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles going forward. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , there have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. We believe the actions described above were sufficient to remediate the identified material weakness.
