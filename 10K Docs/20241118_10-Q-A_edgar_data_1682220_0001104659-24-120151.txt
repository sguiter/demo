(the Form 10-Q ), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on November 14,
2024, is solely to correct the number of the Company s common shares issued and outstanding on November 13, 2024, the latest
practicable date prior to filing the Form 10-Q. The Form 10-Q disclosed 49,965,306 instead of 46,965,306 of the Company s
common due to a clerical error. 

In addition, as required by
Rule 12b-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, new certifications of our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer are included as exhibits to this Amendment. 

This Amendment makes no other
changes to the Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC on November 14, 2024, and no attempt has been made in this Amendment to modify
or update the other disclosures presented in the Form 10-Q. This Amendment does not reflect subsequent events occurring after the
original filing of the Form 10-Q (i.e., those events occurring after November 14, 2024) or modify or update in any way those
disclosures that may be affected by subsequent events. Accordingly, this Amendment should be read in conjunction with the Form 10-Q
and our other filings with the SEC.
