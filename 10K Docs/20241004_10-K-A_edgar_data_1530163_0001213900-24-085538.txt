EXPLANATORY
NOTE 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 

The
Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and President, evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective.

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. Our management s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting
was based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial
reporting was not effective. 

The
ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses which we identified in
our internal control over financial reporting: 

(1) a
lack of multiple levels of management review on complex accounting and financial reporting issues and business transactions, 

(2) a
 lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our
 financial reporting process and accounting functions as a result of our limited resources
 to support hiring of personal and implementation of accounting systems, and 

(3) lack
 of entity level controls due to ineffective board of directors and no audit committee. 

We
believe that these material weaknesses primarily relate, in part, to our lack of sufficient staff with appropriate training in U.S. GAAP
and SEC rules and regulations with respect to financial reporting functions, and the lack of robust accounting systems, as well as the
lack of sufficient resources to hire such staff and implement these accounting systems. 

We
plan to take a number of actions in the future to correct these material weaknesses including, but not limited to, establishing an audit
committee of our board of directors comprised of at least two independent directors, adding experienced accounting and financial personnel
and retaining third-party consultants to review our internal controls and recommend improvements, subject to receiving sufficient additional
capital. We will need to take additional measures to fully mitigate these issues, and the measures we have taken, and expect to take,
to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to (1) address the issues identified, (2) ensure that our internal controls are
effective or (3) ensure that the identified material weakness or other material weaknesses will not result in a material misstatement
of our annual or interim financial statements. In addition, other material weaknesses may be identified in the future. 

Attestation
Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Our management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting
firm pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that permanently exempted smaller reporting companies from the auditor attestation requirement. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d)
of the Exchange Act that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
