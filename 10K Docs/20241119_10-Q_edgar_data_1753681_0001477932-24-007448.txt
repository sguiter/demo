Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (each as defined in Rules) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
