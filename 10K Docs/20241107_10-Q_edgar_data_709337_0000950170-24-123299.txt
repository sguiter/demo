As of September 30, 2024, the Company s security portfolio consisted of securities, of which were in an unrealized loss position. The treasury, agency, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and small business administration securities that the Company owns are all issued by government sponsored entities and therefore contain no potential for credit loss. The Company does not consider any of its available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses to be attributable to credit-related factors, as the unrealized losses have occurred as a result of changes in noncredit related factors such as changes in interest rates, market spreads and market conditions subsequent to purchase, not credit deterioration. The vast majority of the Company's state and political subdivisions holdings are of high credit quality, and are rated AA or higher. In addition, management has both the ability and intent to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery in fair value. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has t recorded an allowance for credit losses on available for sale AFS securities. Equity Securities The Company also holds equity securities which include million in Small Business Investment Company SBIC partnership investments as well as thousand in local and regional bank holdings and other miscellaneous equity funds at September 30, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Company held million in SBIC investments and thousand in local and regional bank holdings and other miscellaneous equity funds. Gains on these equity funds were recognized as income in 2024 and 2023 in compliance with ASU 2016-01, which requires all equity securities to be measured at their fair value with changes in fair value being recognized through the statements of income.

The cumulative loss rate used as the basis for the estimate of credit losses is comprised of the Company's historical loss experience from December 31, 2011 to September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company expects that the markets in which it operates will experience minimal changes to economic conditions, stable trend in unemployment rate, and a level trend of delinquencies. Management adjusted historical loss experience for these expectations. No reversion adjustments were necessary, as the starting point for the Company's estimate was a cumulative loss rate covering the expected contractual term of the portfolio. While there are many factors that go into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses, the change in the balances from September 30, 2023 to September 30,

the accounting guidance in ASU No. 2022-02, effective as of , which eliminates the recognition and measurement of troubled debt restructurings TDR ). Due to the removal of the TDR designation, the Company evaluates all loan restructurings according to the accounting guidance for loan modifications to determine if the restructuring results in a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that result in a direct change in the timing or amount of contractual cash flows include situations where there is principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays, term extensions, and combinations of the listed modifications. Therefore, the disclosures related to loan restructurings are only for modifications that directly affect cash flows.

Total modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty 

September 30, 2023, the Company had loans that defaulted during the period and had been modified in the twelve months prior to that default to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance of the credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. 

million, management monitors the loans on an ongoing basis for any changes in the borrower s ability to service their debt. Management also affirms the risk ratings for the loans in their respective portfolios on an annual basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:

The Company follows ASU 2016-13 to calculate the allowance for credit losses which requires projecting credit losses over the lifetime of the credits. The ACL is adjusted through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge offs of loans. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, the credit risk in the loan portfolio is largely influenced by general economic conditions and trends of the counties and markets in which the debtors operate, and the resulting impact on the operations of borrowers or on the value of any underlying collateral. The credit loss estimation process involves procedures that consider the unique characteristics of the Company s loan portfolio segments. These segments are disaggregated into the loan pools for monitoring. A model of risk characteristics, such as loss history and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-performing loans, as well as existing economic conditions and supportable forecasts are used to determine credit loss assumptions. The Company uses two methodologies to analyze loan pools. The cohort method and the probability of default/loss given default PD/LGD ). Cohort relies on the creation of cohorts to capture loans that qualify for a particular segment, as of a point in time. Those loans are then tracked over their remaining lives to determine their loss experience. The Company aggregates financial assets on the basis of similar risk characteristics when evaluating loans on a collective basis. Those characteristics include, but are not limited to, internal or external credit score, risk ratings, financial asset, loan type, collateral type, size, effective interest rate, term, or geographical location. The Company uses cohort primarily for consumer loan portfolios. The probability of default portion of PD/LGD is defined by the Company as 90 days past due, placed on non-accrual, loan restructuring for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty or is partially, or wholly, charged-off. Typically, a one-year time period is used to assess probability of default PD ). PD can be measured and applied using various risk criteria. Risk rating is one common way to apply PDs. Loss given default LGD is to determine the percentage of loss by facility or collateral type. LGD estimates can sometimes be driven, or influenced, by product type, industry or geography. The Company uses PD/LGD primarily for commercial loan portfolios.

According to the accounting standard, an entity may make an accounting policy election not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable if the entity writes off the applicable accrued interest receivable balance in a timely manner. The Company has made the accounting policy election not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables for all loan segments. Current policy dictates that a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status, with the current accrued interest receivable balance being written off, upon the loan being 90 days delinquent or when the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent and the collateral analysis shows insufficient collateral coverage based on a current assessment of the value of the collateral. In addition, ASC Topic 326 requires the Company to establish a liability for anticipated credit losses for unfunded commitments. To accomplish this, the Company must first establish a loss expectation for extended (funded) commitments. This loss expectation, expressed as a ratio to the amortized cost basis, is then applied to the portion of unfunded commitments not considered unilaterally cancelable, and considered by the company s management as likely to fund over the life of the instrument. At September 30, 2024, the Company had million in unfunded commitments and set aside million in anticipated credit losses. At December 31, 2023, the Company had million in unfunded commitments and set aside million in anticipated credit losses. The million decrease in unfunded commitments and thousand decrease in the reserve for anticipated credit losses is due to existing construction loan projects that are moving forward and advances are being made to the loan. This reserve is recorded in other liabilities as opposed to the ACL. The determination of the ACL is complex and the Company makes decisions on the effects of factors that are inherently uncertain. Evaluations of the loan portfolio and individual credits require certain estimates, assumptions and judgments as to the facts and circumstances related to particular situations or credits. The ACL was million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. The increase of million was due to an increase to the specific reserve related to a non-owner occupied commercial real estate relationship, updates to the Company's delay periods that impacted the loss ratios of certain loan pools under the Cohort methodology, increased Portfolio Composition and growth qualitative factors due to increasing loan balances. These factors were partially offset by the reduction of the specific reserve related to a loan settlement, reduction of the specific reserve related to a payoff of another individually evaluated relationship, and improved loss rates for certain loan pools under the PD/LGD methodology.

, when loans are purchased with evidence of more than significant deterioration of credit, they are accounted for as purchase credit deteriorated PCD ). PCD loans acquired in a transaction are marked to fair value and a mark on yield is recorded. In addition, an adjustment is made to the ACL for the expected loss on the acquisition date. These loans are assessed on a regular basis and subsequent adjustments to the ACL are recorded on the income statement. During 2024, the Company has not acquired any additional PCD loans.

A description of the Company s revenue streams under ASC 606 follows: Service charges on deposit accounts The Company earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Management reviewed the deposit account agreements, and determined that the agreements can be terminated at any time by either the Bank or the account holder. Transaction fees, such as balance transfers, wires and overdraft charges are settled the day the performance obligation is satisfied. The Bank s monthly service charges and maintenance fees are for services provided to the customer on a monthly basis and are considered a series of services that have the same pattern of transfer each month. The review of service charges assessed on deposit accounts included the amount of variable consideration that is a part of the monthly charges. It was found that the waiver of service charges due to insufficient funds and dormant account fees is immaterial and would not require a change in the accounting treatment for these fees under the revenue standards. Debit Card Interchange Fees Customers and the Bank have an account agreement and maintain deposit balances with the Bank. Customers use a bank issued debit card to purchase goods and services, and the Bank earns interchange fees on those transactions, typically a percentage of the sale amount of the transaction. The Bank records the amount due when it receives the settlement from the payment network. Payments from the payment network are received and recorded into income on a daily basis. There are contingent debit card interchange fees recorded by the Company that could be subject to a clawback in future periods. Trust fees Services provided to Trust customers are a series of distinct services that have the same pattern of transfer each month. Fees for trust accounts are billed and drafted from trust accounts monthly. The Company records these fees on the income statement on a monthly basis. Fees are assessed based on the total investable assets of the customer s trust account. A signed contract between the Company and the customer is maintained for all customer trust accounts with payment terms identified. It is probable that the fees will be collectible as funds being managed are accessible by the asset manager. Past history of trust fee income recorded by the Company indicates that it is highly unlikely that a significant reversal could occur. There are contingent incentive fees recorded by the Company that could be subject to a clawback in future periods. Insurance Agency Commissions Insurance agency commissions are received from insurance carriers for the agency s share of commissions from customer premium payments. These commissions are recorded into income when checks are received from the insurance carriers, and there is contingent portion associated with these commission checks. There may be a short time-lag in recording revenue when cash is received instead of recording the revenue when the policy is signed by the customer, but the time lag is insignificant and does not impact the revenue recognition process.

At December 31, 2023, the Company had interest rate swaps associated with commercial loans with a notional value of million and fair value of million in other assets and million in other liabilities. The interest rate swaps with both the customers and third parties are not designated as hedges under FASB ASC 815. As the interest rate swaps are structured to offset each other, changes to the underlying benchmark interest rates considered in the valuation of these instruments do not result in an impact to earnings; however, there may be fair value adjustments related to credit quality variations between counterparties, which may impact earnings as required by FASB ASC 820. There were net gains or losses for interest rate swaps for the either the three or the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Interest Rate Swap Designated as a Fair Value Hedge The Company has one interest rate swap with a notional amount of million that was in place at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. This swap is designated as a fair value hedge to mitigate the risk of further interest rate increases and the subsequent impact on the valuation of the company s state and political subdivision municipal bond portfolio. The gross aggregate fair value of the swap at September 30, 2024 was million and was recorded as a million mark to market adjustment in other assets and thousand was recorded to other assets for the accrued interest receivable. At December 31, 2023, the gross aggregate fair value of the swap was thousand and was recorded as a million mark to market adjustment in other liabilities, and thousand was recorded to other assets for the accrued interest receivable. The Company expects the hedge to remain in effect for the remaining term of the swap, which matures August 2026.

Mortgage Banking Derivatives Commitments to fund certain mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third-party investors are considered derivatives. The Company enters into forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans when the interest rate locks are committed in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans. These mortgage banking derivatives are not designated in hedge relationships.

Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If only adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution s category.

Item 2. Manageme nt s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact, but rather statements based on the Company s current expectations, beliefs and assumptions regarding the future of Farmers business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, its intended results and future performance, the economy and other future conditions. Forward-looking statements are preceded by terms such as will, would, should, could, may, expect, estimate, believe, anticipate, intend, plan, project, or variations of these words, or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and actual future results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Numerous uncertainties, risks, and changes could cause or contribute to Farmers actual results, performance, and achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, without limitation, risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission ), including without limitation, the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, as updated in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Many of these factors are beyond the Company s ability to control or predict, and readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on those forward-looking statements. The following, which is not intended to be an all-encompassing list, summarizes several factors that could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected in any forward-looking statement: 
 
 general economic conditions in markets where the Company conducts business, which could materially impact credit quality trends; 

the length and extent of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; 

the length and extent of the economic impacts of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine; 

actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply, market interest rates and inflation; 

disruptions in the mortgage and lending markets and significant or unexpected fluctuations in interest rates related to governmental responses to inflation, including financial stimulus packages and interest rate changes; 

general business conditions in the banking industry; 

the regulatory environment; 

general fluctuations in interest rates; 

demand for loans in the market areas where the Company conducts business; 

rapidly changing technology and evolving banking industry standards; 

competitive factors, including increased competition with regional and national financial institutions; 

Farmers' ability to attract, recruit and retain skilled employees; and 

new service and product offerings by competitors and price pressures. 

Other factors not currently anticipated may also materially and adversely affect the Company s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. There can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations. While the Company believes that the forward-looking statements in the presentation are reasonable, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. In addition, these statements speak only as of the date made. The Company does not undertake, and expressly disclaims, any obligation to update or alter any statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable law.

Net Income. The Company reported net income of 8.5 million, or 0.23 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 13.3 million, or 0.36 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The results for the third quarter of 2024 were impacted by a single 12.5 million commercial credit backed by office space which resulted in a 4.4 million charge-off along with the establishment of a specific reserve on the credit in the amount of 1.2 million. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 31.6 million, or 0.84 per diluted share, compared to 35.4 million, or 0.94 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was due to a decline in net interest income partially offset by lower noninterest expense. 
 
 Net Interest Income . The following schedule details the various components of net interest income for the periods indicated. All asset yields are calculated on a tax-equivalent basis where applicable. Security yields are based on amortized cost.

(2) Interest on certain tax-exempt loans and tax-exempt securities in 2024 and 2023 is not taxable for Federal income tax purposes. In order to compare the tax-exempt yields on these assets to taxable yields, the interest earned on these assets is adjusted to a pre-tax equivalent amount based on the marginal corporate federal income tax rate of 21 

Net Interest Income. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 31.9 million compared to 33.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. A 20 basis point decline in the net interest margin was the primary reason for this decrease. 
 The net interest margin for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, was 2.66 compared to 2.86 for the same period in 2023. Interest-earning asset yields increased 23 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 54 basis points when comparing these two periods. This increase in funding costs has been due to the rapid increase in deposit rates, intense competition for deposits and the Federal Reserve rate hiking cycle which resulted in an inverted yield curve. This increase in funding costs continues to outstrip the increases on the yield of interest-earning assets pushing the net interest margin lower. 
 Net interest income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, was 95.6 million compared to 105.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest income was driven by the same factors as discussed above. The net interest margin was 2.69 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.95 for the same period in 2023. The decline in net interest margin for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, was also driven by the same factors discussed previously. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses and Provision for Unfunded Loans. The provision for credit losses and unfunded commitments totaled 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 243,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increased provision for credit losses was primarily due to the increased level of net charge-offs and reserving activity resulting from the 
 47 

deterioration in a single commercial real estate credit backed by office space. Strong loan growth during the quarter also increased provision costs during the quarter. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses and unfunded loans of 7.7 million compared to 8.9 million for the same period in 2023. Included in the 8.9 million figure in 2023 was a Day 1 provision for credit losses and provision for unfunded loans under the current expected credit loss model CECL of 7.7 million related to the acquisition of Emlenton. There was no Day 1 provision recorded in 2024. 
 
 Noninterest Income. Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was of 12.3 million compared to 9.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. This increase was due to solid growth in the Company s fee based business lines along with gains from SBIC funds and a 444 thousand gain on the purchase of 3 million of the Company s subordinated debt. 
 
 Service charges on deposit accounts increased 280 thousand to 2.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.7 million for the third quarter in 2023. The Company undertook a review of all service charges in late 2023 and early 2024 and implemented fee increases across deposit product lines in the second quarter of 2024. Trust fees increased by 217 thousand to 2.5 million at September 30, 2024, from 2.3 million at September 30, 2023. The increase was due to continued growth in the business unit. Insurance agency commissions grew to 1.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 1.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase has been driven by strong growth in fixed annuity sales. Losses on the sale of securities totaled 403 thousand in the third quarter of 2024 compared to losses on the sale of securities of 624 thousand during the third quarter of 2023. Net gains on the sale of loans increased to 506 thousand in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 395 thousand in the third quarter of 2023. Greater saleable volume drove this increase. Other mortgage banking fee income was a loss of 168 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 compared to income of 185 thousand during the third quarter of 2023. The decline in income was due to an impairment charge on the Company s higher coupon mortgage servicing right tranches in the third quarter of 2024. Debit card income grew to 2.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 1.8 million in the third quarter of 2023 as better volumes were realized in the current period. Other noninterest income increased from 1.1 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 2.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. The Company recorded 854 thousand more in SBIC income in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. In addition, the Company purchased 3.0 million of its subordinated debt during the third quarter of 2024 recording a gain of 444 thousand. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company had no gains from the purchase of subordinated debt but instead recorded losses of 110 thousand on assets held for sale. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income increased by 597 thousand compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to growth in service charges and the Company's fee based businesses offset by security losses of 2.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to security losses of 490 thousand for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Service charges on deposit accounts increased by 775 thousand in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to the fee increases discussed above. Bank owned life insurance income increased to 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as crediting rates on the insurance policies continue to increase. Trust fees increased to 7.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 6.7 million in the first nine months of 2023 due to continued strong growth in this line of business. Insurance agency commissions were 4.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 3.9 million for the same period in 2023. Strong annuity sales in 2024 drove the increase. Other mortgage banking fee income declined to 150 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 571 thousand for the same time in 2023. The decline was primarily due to the impairment charge discussed above. Other noninterest income increased to 3.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 2.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. The Company recorded 897 thousand more in SBIC income in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense totaled 27.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 27.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The third quarter of 2023 included 268 thousand of merger related charges. There were no merger related expenses during the third quarter of 2024. Salaries and employee benefits were 14.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 14.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries associated with employee raises along with higher health care expenses. FDIC and state and local taxes decreased by 168 thousand to 1.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.6 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to lower FDIC premiums. Intangible amortization declined to 629 thousand in the third quarter of 2024 from 725 thousand for the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was driven by amortization from a prior acquisition running off. Other noninterest expense decreased 804 thousand in the third quarter of 2024 to 3.4 million from 4.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. The primary reason for the decrease was due to a 785 thousand charge incurred in 2023 for the settlement of a lawsuit. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense decreased to 80.5 million from 84.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In 2023, the Company incurred 5.0 million of merger related costs while no merger costs were incurred in 
 48 

2024. Salaries and employee benefits increased to 44.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 42.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by salary increases associated with employee raises along with increased healthcare costs. FDIC and state and local taxes decreased 355 thousand to 4.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 4.4 million for the first nine months of 2023 due to improvements in the Bank's FDIC assessment variables. Professional fees increased 185 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to increased legal fees. Intangible amortization declined 909 thousand in the first nine months of 2024 to 1.9 million compared to 2.9 million for the first nine months of 2023. This decrease was driven by accelerated amortization that occurred in 2023 that did not reoccur in 2024 and amortization from a prior acquisition running off. 
 
 Income Taxes . Income tax expense was 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in tax expense was primarily due to the decline in income before income taxes. 
 Income tax expense increased from 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in tax expense was primarily due to the Company dissolving Farmers National Captive, Inc. in November of 2023 so the Company is no longer receiving the tax benefits associated with this business. 
 Financial Condition 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents increased 85.5 million during the first nine months of 2024 to 189.1 million from 103.7 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in the cash balances was primarily due to the Company intentionally holding more liquidity on its balance sheet at September 30, 2024. 
 Securities . Securities available-for-sale decreased to 1.29 billion at September 30, 2024, from 1.30 billion at December 31, 2023. Gross unrealized losses on the portfolio totaled 195.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to gross unrealized losses of 222.6 million at December 31, 2023. In addition to the changes in the gross unrealized loss on the securities, the Company has also received 91.2 million in proceeds from the sale, maturity and repayments on securities during the first nine months of 2024. This has been partially offset by purchases totaling 60.3 million through the first nine months of 2024. 
 Loans. Net loans (excluding loans held for sale) increased to 3.28 billion at September 30, 2024 from 3.20 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in 2024 has been due to growth in every major category of loans.

ASU 2022-02 was adopted on January 1, 2023 and such, non-performing loans balances include prior period TDRs and subsequent to January 1, 2023, loans with modifications to borrowers with financial difficulty are included in non-performing loans. 
 The Company's allowance for credit losses increased to 36.2 million for the period ended September 30, 2024, from 34.4 million for the period ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by loan growth and the 1.2 million specific reserve placed on the one commercial loan in the third quarter of 2024. The Company estimates the ACL based on the amortized cost basis of the underlying loan and has made an accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest from the loan s amortized cost basis and the related measurement of the ACL. Estimating the amount of the ACL is a function of a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in the loan portfolio, net charge-offs, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, and the level of potential problem loans, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. 
 Based on the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, management believes that the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 is adequate. The provision for credit losses is based on management s judgment after taking into consideration all factors connected with the collectability of the existing loan portfolio. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Specific factors considered by management in determining the amounts charged to operating expenses include previous credit loss experience, the status of past 
 50 

due interest and principal payments, the quality of financial information supplied by loan customers and the general condition of the industries in the community to which loans have been made. 
 Deposits. Total deposits increased to 4.36 billion at September 30, 2024 from 4.18 billion at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to growth in interest-bearing deposits as customers seek higher yields on their deposit balances offset by declines in non-interest bearing deposits. In addition, the Company acquired 74.9 million of brokered time deposits which it used to pay down short-term borrowings. 
 Short-term Borrowings. Total short-term borrowing balances decreased from 355.0 million at December 31, 2023 to 285.0 million at September 30, 2024. This decrease was due to the Company using the proceeds from brokered time deposits to pay down short-term borrowings. 
 Total Stockholders' Equity. Total stockholders equity increased to 439.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 404.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 21.6 million reduction in the accumulated other comprehensive loss offset by growth in retained earnings of 12.4 million. 
 The capital management function is a regular process that consists of providing capital for both the current financial position and the anticipated future growth of the Company. At September 30, 2024, the Company is required to maintain 4.5 common equity tier 1 to risk weighted assets excluding the conservation buffer to be adequately capitalized. The Company s common equity tier 1 to risk weighted assets was 10.91 , total risk-based capital ratio stood at 14.34 , and the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio were at 11.39 and 8.20 , respectively, at September 30, 2024. Management believes that the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject, as of September 30, 2024. 
 Federal bank regulatory agencies finalized a rule that simplifies capital requirements for community banks by allowing them to adopt a simple leverage ratio to measure capital adequacy. The community bank leverage ratio framework removes requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for a qualifying community bank that opts into the framework. The Company has not elected to adopt this framework. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The Company follows financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These policies are presented in Note 1 of the consolidated audited financial statements in the Company s Annual Report to Shareholders included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company has identified two accounting policies that are critical accounting policies and an understanding of these policies is necessary to understand the Company s financial statements. These policies relate to determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and if there is any impairment of goodwill or other intangible. Additional information regarding these policies is included in the notes to the aforementioned 2023 consolidated financial statements, Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 4 (Loans), and the sections captioned Loan Portfolio. 
 Farmers maintains an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is presented as a reserve against loans on the balance sheets. Credit losses are charged off against the allowance for credit losses, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance for credit losses. A provision for credit losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of adequacy of the allowance. 
 The Company s allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Company s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. 
 The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including the weighting of macroeconomic forecasts and microeconomic statistics, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 4 for further information on these judgments as well as the Company s policies and methodologies used to determine the Company s allowance for credit losses. 
 51 

A significant judgment involved in estimating the Company s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the four-quarter forecast period within the Company s methodology. The four-quarter forecast incorporates three macroeconomic variables MEV that are relevant for exposures across the Company. 
 U.S. changes in real gross domestic product (GDP). 

U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation. 

U.S. civilian unemployment rate. 

Changes in the Company s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. 
 It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. 
 To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Company compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included the three MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the four-quarter forecast period. 
 For example, compared to the Company s central scenario that is based on a four-quarter forecasted change in U.S. real GDP of 2.00 from 4Q2024 to 4Q2025 U.S. PCE inflation of 2.10 , and U.S. unemployment of 4.40 , the Company s relative adverse scenario assumes a four-quarter forecast with a contraction of U.S. real GDP, a PCE inflation between 5.00 and 7.00 and an elevated U.S. unemployment rate between 6.00 and 7.00 . This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including: 
 The impacts of changes in the MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables. 

Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses. 

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of September 30, 2024, the Company compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario for two of the Company s largest loan pools to its central scenario for the same loan pools. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Company s allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences: 
 An increase of approximately 650 thousand for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments 

An increase of approximately 1.14 million for commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans and lending-related commitments 

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in the other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. 
 Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the Company believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company uses two methodologies to analyze loan pools. The cohort method and the PD/LGD. Cohort relies on the creation of cohorts to capture loans that qualify for a particular segment, as of a point in time. Those loans are then tracked over their remaining lives to determine their loss experience. The Company aggregates financial assets on the basis of similar risk characteristics when evaluating loans on a collective basis. Those characteristics include, but are not limited to, internal or external credit score, risk ratings, financial asset, loan type, collateral type, size, effective interest rate, term, or geographical location. The Company uses cohort primarily for consumer loan portfolios. 
 52 

The PD portion of PD/LGD is defined by the Company as 90 days past due, placed on non-accrual, or is partially or wholly charged-off. Typically, a one-year time period is used to assess PD. PD can be measured and applied using various risk criteria. Risk rating is one common way to apply PDs. LGD is to determine the percentage of loss by facility or collateral type. LGD estimates can sometimes be driven, or influenced, by product type, industry or geography. The Company uses PD/LGD primarily for commercial loan portfolios. 
 Management believes that the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets also involves a higher degree of judgment than most other significant accounting policies. GAAP establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the impairment assessment of goodwill. Goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible assets in the business acquired. The Company s goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking industry and that value is dependent upon the ability of the Company s subsidiaries to provide quality, cost-effective services in a competitive marketplace. The goodwill value is supported by revenue that is in part driven by the volume of business transacted. A decrease in earnings resulting from a decline in the customer base or the inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. GAAP requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The fair value of the goodwill is estimated by reviewing the past and projected operating results for the subsidiaries and comparable industry information. At September 30, 2024, on a consolidated basis, Farmers had intangibles of 20.9 million subject to amortization and 167.4 million in goodwill, which was not subject to periodic amortization. 
 Liquidity 
 The Company maintains, in the opinion of management, liquidity sufficient to satisfy depositors requirements and meet the credit needs of customers. The Company depends on its ability to maintain its market share of deposits as well as acquiring new funds. The Company s ability to attract deposits and borrow funds depends in large measure on its profitability, capitalization and overall financial condition. The Company s objective in liquidity management is to maintain the ability to meet loan commitments, purchase securities or to repay deposits and other liabilities in accordance with their terms without an adverse impact on current or future earnings. Principal sources of liquidity for the Company include assets considered relatively liquid, such as federal funds sold, cash-due from banks, as well as cash flows from maturities and repayments of loans, and to a lesser extent securities. 
 Along with its liquid assets, the Bank has additional sources of liquidity available which help to ensure that adequate funds are available as needed. These other sources include, but are not limited to, access to funds in the wholesale arena, the ability to obtain deposits through the adjustment of interest rates and the purchasing of federal funds and borrowings on approved lines of credit at major domestic banks. At September 30, 2024, this line of credit totaled 25.0 million of which the Bank had not borrowed against. In addition, the Company has a revolving line of credit with a correspondent bank totaling 5.0 million. There was no balance on this line at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Management feels that its liquidity position is adequate and will continue to monitor the position on a monthly basis. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had no outstanding balances with the FHLB. Additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB was approximately 695.8 million at September 30, 2024. The Company also has access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window, which provides an additional source of funds with the posting of collateral. The Bank views its membership in the FHLB as a solid source of liquidity. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the normal course of business, to meet the financial needs of our customers, we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage, commercial and consumer loans, and involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bank s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Because some commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The same credit policies are used in making commitments as are used for on-balance sheet instruments. Collateral is required in instances where deemed necessary. Undisbursed balances of loans closed include funds not disbursed but committed for construction projects. Unused lines of credit include funds not disbursed, but committed for, home equity, commercial and consumer lines of credit. Financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily used to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Total unused commitments were 731.7 million at September 30, 2024, and 805.4 million at December 31, 2023. Additionally, the Company has committed up to 20.2 million in subscriptions in SBIC investment funds. At September 30, 2024, the Company had invested 16.5 million in these funds.

Recent Market and Regulatory Developments 
 Various and significant legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry is from time to time introduced in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. 
 Also, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies and are subject to change at any time, particularly in the current economic and regulatory environment. Any such change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company could have a material effect on the business of the Company. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Important considerations in asset/liability management are liquidity, the balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the adequacy of capital. Interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are those which have rates subject to change within a future time period due to maturity of the instrument or changes in market rates. While liquidity management involves meeting the funds flow requirements of the Company, the management of interest rate sensitivity focuses on the structure of these assets and liabilities with respect to maturity and repricing characteristics. Managing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities provides a means of tempering fluctuating interest rates and maintaining net interest margins through periods of changing interest rates. The Company monitors interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to determine the overall interest rate position over various time frames. 
 The Company considers the primary market exposure to be interest rate risk. Simulation analysis is used to monitor the Company s exposure to changes in interest rates, and the effect of the change to net interest income. The following table shows the effect on net interest income and the net present value of equity from a sudden and sustained 400 basis point increase to a 400 basis point decrease in market interest rates. The assumptions and predictions include inputs to compute baseline net interest income, expected changes in rates on interest bearing deposit accounts and loans, competition and various other factors that are difficult to accurately predict.

The yield curve has changed dramatically over the past two years. In an intense effort to diffuse inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the discount rate 5.25 from March 2022 to July 2023, the fastest pace on record. The committee then held the discount rate at 5.5 until September 2024 when they cut the discount rate by 50 basis points, and set the rate at 5.0 in an attempt to guide the economy into a soft landing , where the still comparatively elevated rate of 5.0 will continue to bring down inflation without harming the job market or the economy. 
 
 The above table presents results in the up rate scenarios that exceed internal policy limits for the Economic Value of Equity EVE for both the current quarter end as well as the last year end. This unprecedented outcome was created by the events occurring over the past two years, namely, the massive influx of liquidity in the form of deposits in 2020 and 2021 from government assistance while interest rates were at their lowest; the deployment of those funds at those low rates; and now the usage of those deposits as consumers 
 54 

utilize their deposits to maintain living standards in this highly inflationary economy, which prevents the Company from investing in the higher rates now available. With the EVE model moving rates even higher, it further exacerbates the differential between market rates and book rates, thereby creating the out of internal policy consequence. To mitigate these results, the Company has prioritized employing strategies to shrink the longer duration investment portfolio and replace the balances with assets having a shorter duration, including loans, in an effort to close the gap between the book and market rates. Any growth in lending will be done in a measured manner given the uncertain economic backdrop that exists today. The Company recognizes the risk inherent in growing loans but feels that its historical record of prudent underwriting, its low loan to deposit ratio and its strong credit metrics provide the ability to pursue solid opportunities in the marketplace. In addition, any loan growth will be broad based encompassing consumer, indirect, 1-4 family, commercial and industrial and CRE so as not to increase risk in any one portfolio or sector. 
 
 The remaining results of the simulations in the table above indicate that interest rate change results fall within internal limits established by the Company at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. A report on interest rate risk is presented to the Board of Directors and the Asset/Liability Committee on a quarterly basis. The Company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes. 
 
 With the largest amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities maturing within twelve months, the Company monitors this area most closely. Early withdrawal of deposits, prepayments of loans and loan delinquencies are some of the factors that can impact actual results in comparison to our simulation analysis. In addition, changes in rates on interest sensitive assets and liabilities may not be equal, which could result in a change in net interest margin. 
 
 Interest rate sensitivity management provides some degree of protection against net interest income volatility. It is not possible or necessarily desirable to attempt to eliminate this risk completely by matching interest sensitive assets and liabilities. Other factors, such as market demand, interest rate outlook, regulatory restraint and strategic planning also have an effect on the desired balance sheet structure. 
 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures 
 Based on their evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective. There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART I I - OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. L egal Proceedings 
 The Company is a defendant in lawsuits and other adversary proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Legal costs incurred in connection with the resolution of claims and lawsuits are generally expensed as incurred, although the Company establishes accruals where losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. The Company s assessment of the current exposure with respect to adverse claims in legal matters could change in the event of the discovery of additional facts in such matters or upon determinations by judges, juries, administrative agencies or other finders of fact that are inconsistent with the Company s evaluation of claims. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations in a particular future period as the time and amount of any resolution of such actions and its relationship to the future results of operations are not known. 
 Item 1A. Risk Fact ors 
 The Company is exposed to risk when other financial institutions experience financial difficulties which could have an adverse impact on the banking industry environment in which the Company operates. The collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank have caused uncertainty in the investor community and banking customers. While the Company does not believe that the circumstances of these three bank failures are indicators of broader issues within the banking system, the failures may reduce customer confidence, affect sources of funding and liquidity, increase regulatory requirements and costs, adversely affect financial markets and/or have a negative reputational ramification for the financial services industry, including the Company. The Company will continue to monitor the ongoing events concerning these three banks as well as any future potential bank failures and volatility within the financial services industry generally, together with any responsive measures taken by the banking regulators to mitigate or manage potential turmoil in the financial services industry. 
 For further discussion of risk factors related to the Company, refer to Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, contained in the Company s 2023 10-K. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 55 

Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect us. There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10K. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Purchases of equity securities by the issuer. 
 On March 1, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of its common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, from time to time and subject to market and other conditions. This 2023 Repurchase Program supersedes the Company's 2019 share repurchase program. The 2023 Repurchase Program may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time.

To achieve this goal, the Company originally established this Executive Separation Policy effective November 7, 2013 (the Original Effective Date ), adopted an Amended and Restated Executive Separation Policy effective June 23, 2015 First Amended Policy ), and adopted a Second Amended and Restated Executive Separation Policy effective June 1, 2017 Second Amended Policy ), to provide such employees with certain types of financial security and sufficient incentives to accept and continue their executive employment. This Third Amended and Restated Executive Separation Policy (this Policy describes the separation pay and benefits that the Company will provide to Covered Executives (as defined below) if their employment with the Company terminates under certain circumstances. The Company also seeks through this Policy to ensure that the separation process is handled professionally and efficiently.

b) The Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee may, from time to time, designate other persons holding other executive positions who are not members of the Company s Senior Management Committee as Covered Executives under this Policy and the level of severance pay and benefits that such persons shall receive under this Policy. 

3. Termination of Employment 

The Company may terminate a Covered Executive s employment with the Company, with or without Cause, and a Covered Executive may terminate his or her employment with the Company for or without Good Reason, subject, however, in each case, to the terms and conditions of any written employment agreement between the Covered Executive and the Company. 

A. Termination by Company for Cause or by Covered Executive Without Good Reason 

If the Company terminates a Covered Executive s employment with the Company for Cause, or a Covered Executive terminates his or her employment with the Company without Good Reason, the Covered Executive will be entitled to: (1) all earned but unpaid compensation for time worked through the Termination Date, to be paid on the Payment Date; and (2) any rights and benefits (if any) provided under plans and programs of the Company, determined in accordance with the applicable terms and provisions of such plans and programs, including, without limitation, earned but unused vacation (the payments described in this Section 3.A are collectively referred to as the Accrued Obligations ). Other than payment of the Accrued Obligations, a Covered Executive whose employment with the Company terminates as described in this Section 3.A shall not be entitled to receive any other severance pay or benefits. Nothing in the foregoing is intended to limit a Covered Executive s ability to continue participating in the Company s group health, dental and vision plans for the applicable COBRA continuation period, provided that the Covered Executive properly elects COBRA continuation coverage and pays the applicable COBRA premiums. 
 B. Termination by Company Without Cause or by Covered Executive for Good Reason 

If the Company terminates a Covered Executive s employment with the Company without Cause, or a Covered Executive terminates his or her employment with the Company for Good Reason, the Company will, subject to the terms and conditions of this Policy, provide the severance pay and benefits set forth below to the Covered Executive based on the Covered Executive s position on the date of termination. 
 (1) If the Covered Executive is the Chief Executive Officer, the Covered Executive will receive the following severance pay and benefits: 

(a) the Accrued Obligations; 

(b) if the Covered Executive was employed by the Company on the Original Effective Date, a lump sum amount equal to 36 months of the Covered Executive s then-current base salary (or, if greater, the base salary immediately prior to any reduction constituting Good Reason), to be paid on the Payment Date; if the Covered Executive was not employed by the Company on the Original Effective Date, a lump sum amount equal to 24 months of the Covered Executive s then-current base salary (or, if greater, the base salary immediately prior to any reduction constituting Good Reason), to be paid on the Payment Date; 

(c) a pro rata incentive bonus in a lump sum amount determined by multiplying the annual incentive that the Covered Executive would have earned under the Company s annual incentive plan for the year in which the termination occurred, assuming that performance had 

been attained at the target level as based on a percentage of the Covered Executive s then-current base salary (or, if greater, the base salary immediately prior to any reduction constituting Good Reason), by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed during the calendar year prior to the Termination Date and the denominator of which is 365, to be paid on the Payment Date; 

(d) a lump sum amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium payable by the Covered Executive to continue to receive health benefits at a level similar to which the Covered Executive and his or her spouse and dependents, if any, were participating immediately prior to the termination, in order to continue to receive such benefits during the applicable COBRA coverage period, multiplied by (i) 36 if the Covered Executive was employed by the Company on the Original Effective Date, or (ii) 24 if the Covered Executive was not employed by the Company on the Original Effective Date; and 

(e) a lump sum payment in an amount not to exceed 10,000 for reasonable outplacement services by a firm selected by the Company, for a period of such services lasting not longer than one (1) year after the Termination Date.

(c) a pro rata incentive bonus in a lump sum amount determined by multiplying the annual incentive that the Covered Executive would have earned under the Company s annual incentive plan for the year in which the termination occurred, assuming that performance had been attained at the target level as based on a percentage of the Covered Executive s then-current base salary (or, if greater, the base salary immediately prior to any reduction constituting Good Reason), by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed during the calendar year prior to the Termination Date and the denominator of which is 365, to be paid on the Payment Date; 

(d) a lump sum amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium payable by the Covered Executive to continue to receive health benefits at a 

2 

level similar to which the Covered Executive and his or her spouse and dependents, if any, were participating immediately prior to the termination, in order to continue to receive such benefits during the applicable COBRA coverage period, multiplied by 18; and 

(e) a lump sum payment in an amount not to exceed 7,500 for reasonable outplacement services by a firm selected by the Company, for a period of such services lasting not longer than one (1) year after the Termination Date. 

(3) If the Covered Executive is not the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Banking Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Wealth Management Officer, Chief Retail and Marketing Officer, or Corporate Development Officer, the Covered Executive will receive the following severance pay and benefits:

(d) a lump sum amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium payable by the Covered Executive to continue to receive health benefits at a level similar to which the Covered Executive and his or her spouse and dependents, if any, were participating immediately prior to the termination, in order to continue to receive such benefits during the applicable COBRA coverage period, multiplied by 12; and 

(e) a lump sum payment in an amount not to exceed 7,500 for reasonable outplacement services by a firm selected by the Company, for a period of such services lasting not longer than one (1) year after the Termination Date. 

1. Eligibility For Separation Pay and Benefits 

3 

Except with respect to the Accrued Obligations, the Company s obligations to provide any severance pay and benefits under this Policy are conditioned upon the following: 
 A. The Covered Executive s execution prior to the first date that any payment (other than the Accrued Obligations) is to begin, of a valid, enforceable, full and unconditional release reasonably acceptable to the Company, generally in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto, of all claims whether known or unknown that the Covered Executive may have against the Company, its officers, fiduciaries, directors, agents, and employees as of the Termination Date. 

B. The Covered Executive agrees to the following: 

(i) Non-Competition. For a period of 12 consecutive months after the Termination Date, the Covered Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, as owner, partner, joint venturer, stockholder (excluding the ownership of publicly-traded securities where such ownership does not exceed 1 of such securities outstanding), employee, officer, director, agent, principal, trustee or in any other business capacity whatsoever, engage in, become financially interested in, become employed by, render any consulting or business advice with respect to, or have any other connection with, any person or business entity engaged in the same business as the Company or an affiliate in any county where the Company or an affiliate maintains a branch or loan production office at the time of termination of the Covered Executive s employment. 

(ii) Non-Solicitation of Customers. For a period equal to the lesser of (a) 24, or (b) the number of months of the Covered Executive s base salary used as a multiplier in Section B(1)(b), B(2)(b), or B(3)(b) as applicable, consecutive months after the Termination Date, the Covered Executive shall not, directly or indirectly solicit Business from any customers, clients or business patrons of the Company or an affiliate who were customers, clients or business patrons of the Company or an affiliate at the time of termination of the Covered Executive s employment. 

(iii) Non-Solicitation of Employees. For a period equal to the lesser of (a) 24, or (b) the number of months of the Covered Executive s base salary used as a multiplier in Section B(1)(b), B(2)(b), or B(3)(b) as applicable, consecutive months after the Termination Date, the Covered Executive shall not, directly or indirectly employ or attempt to employ or solicit for employment any other individual who is employed by the Company or an affiliate at the time of termination of the Covered Executive s employment. 

(iv) Confidential Information. The Covered Executive shall not directly or indirectly communicate or divulge any Confidential Information relating to the Company or an affiliate to any other person or business entity. All records, files, plans, documents and the like relating to the business of the Company or an affiliate, including but not limited to Confidential Information which the Executive has or will prepare, use or come into 

4 

contact with shall remain the sole property of the Company or an affiliate, shall not be copied without written permission, and shall be returned immediately to the Company or an affiliate upon the Covered Executive s termination of employment with the Company or an affiliate, or at the request of the Company or an affiliate at any time. Further, the Executive shall not directly or indirectly use or disclose to any other person or business entity any secret or Confidential Information of the Company or an affiliate without the prior written consent of an officer of the Company or an affiliate. The Executive further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to protect against the negligent or inadvertent disclosure of the secret or Confidential Information of the Company or an affiliate to any other person or business entity. If the Executive improperly uses or discloses any secret or Confidential Information of the Company or an affiliate, the Executive understands that the Covered Executive s employment will be subject to termination for Cause. The Executive also recognizes that all writings, illustrations, drawings and other similar materials that embody or otherwise contain Confidential Information which the Executive may produce or which may be given to the Executive in connection with the Executive s employment, are the property of the Company or an affiliate and it shall be the Executive s obligation to deliver the same to the Company or an affiliate upon request, and upon termination of the Covered Executive s employment with the Company or an affiliate for any reason. 

(v) Intellectual Property Rights. The Covered Executive agrees and acknowledges that all Work Product shall be the sole, exclusive and absolute property of the Company or an affiliate. All such Work Product shall be deemed to be works for hire and the Executive assigns to the Company all rights, title and interest in, to and under such Work Product, including but not limited to, the right to obtain such patents, copyright registrations, trademark registrations or similar protections as the Company or an affiliate may desire to obtain. The Executive shall immediately disclose all Work Product to the Company or an affiliate and agrees, at any time upon the Company s or an affiliate s request and without additional compensation, to execute any documents and to otherwise cooperate with the Company or an affiliate respecting the perfection of its rights, title and interest in, to and under such Work Product, and in any litigation or other controversy in connection therewith, all reasonable expenses incident thereto to be borne by the Company or an affiliate. For purposes of this Policy, Work Product means any procedure, design feature, schematic, invention, improvement, development, discovery, know how, concept, idea or the like (whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or trademark laws, or otherwise protectable under similar laws) that the Executive may conceive of, suggest, make, invent, develop or implement during the course of the Executive s employment with the Company or an affiliate (whether individually or jointly with any other person), relating in any way to the Business, and all physical embodiments and manifestations thereof, and all patent rights, copyrights, trademarks (or application therefore) and similar protections therein. 

5 

(vi) Non-disparagement. The Covered Executive agrees that he or she will not knowingly make any statement or take any action likely to disparage or have an adverse effect on the Company s business reputation; provided, however, that such restriction will not prevent the Covered Executive from making any statement or taking any action that is required by law. 

(vii) In the event of a breach by the Covered Executive of any covenant set forth in this Section 4(B), the term of such covenant will be extended by the period of the duration of such breach and such covenant will survive any termination of this Agreement but only for the limited period of such extension. The restrictions provided in this Section 4(B) are in addition to any restrictions on competition or solicitation contained in any other agreement between the Company or an affiliate and the Executive. The provisions of this Section 4(B) constitute an essential element of this Agreement, without which the Company would not have entered into this Agreement. If the scope of any restriction contained in this Section 4(B) is too broad to permit enforcement of such restriction to its fullest extent, then such restriction will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the Executive hereby consents and agrees that such scope may be judicially modified accordingly in any proceeding brought to enforce such restriction. 

(viii) Notwithstanding any other remedy available, the restrictions described in this Section 4(B) may be enforced by the Company, an affiliate and/or any successor thereto, by an action to recover payments made under this Agreement, an action for injunction, and/or an action for damages. In the event the Company or an affiliate obtains a permanent injunction against the Executive after notice and the opportunity to appear, the Executive shall be liable to pay all costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, which the Company or an affiliate may incur in enforcing, to any extent, the provisions of this Agreement, whether or not litigation is actually commenced and including litigation of any appeal taken or defended by the Company or an affiliate in any action to enforce this Agreement and which affirms and/or results in a permanent injunction. Any proceedings brought to enforce Section 5 of this Agreement shall be brought in the courts of Mahoning County, Ohio and the Executive expressly waives any objection or defense relating to jurisdiction or forum non-conveniens or similar doctrine or theory. The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for any breach of this Section 5 shall be inadequate, and that the Company or an affiliate shall be entitled to injunctive relief without bond. Such injunctive relief shall not be exclusive, but shall be in addition to any other rights or remedies which the Company or an affiliate may have for any such breach. In addition to the injunctive remedies described herein, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a final judicial determination against the Executive with respect to an actual or threatened breach by the Executive of this Section 5, the Company shall be entitled to withhold any remaining amounts payments payable under Section 3 of this Agreement. 

6 

C. After the Termination Date, the Covered Executive agrees to provide reasonable assistance and cooperation with the Company concerning business or legal related matters about which the Covered Executive possesses relevant knowledge or information. Such cooperation will be provided only at the Company s specific request and will include, but not be limited to, assisting or advising the Company with respect to any business-related matters or any actual or threatened legal action (including testifying in depositions, hearings, and/or trials). The Covered Executive will be reimbursed for the reasonable costs of providing assistance and cooperation, including, without limitation, reasonable travel and lodging expenses. 

D. The Company s obligation to provide separation pay and benefits under this Policy will cease immediately if the Company determines that Covered Executive failed to comply with any of the foregoing conditions, and the Covered Executive will be required to return to the Company (with ten (10) days after request by the Company) any amounts the Company has paid to the Covered Executive under this Policy other than the Accrued Obligations. 

2. Section 409A 

This Policy is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), or an exemption or exclusion therefrom, and, with respect to amounts that are subject to Section 409A of the Code, shall in all respects be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. 
 Each payment under this Policy shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. In no event may the Covered Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Policy. If the Covered Executive dies following the Termination Date and prior to the payment of the any amounts delayed on account of Section 409A of the Code, such amounts shall be paid to the personal representative of the Covered Executive s estate within 30 days after the date of the Covered Executive s death. 
 All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Policy that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, without limitation, that (i) in no event shall reimbursements by the Company under this Policy be made later than the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the applicable fees and expenses were incurred, provided, that the Covered Executive shall have submitted an invoice for such fees and expenses at least ten (10) days before the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which such fees and expenses were incurred; (ii) the amount of in-kind benefits that the Company is obligated to pay or provide in any given calendar year shall not affect the in-kind benefits that the Company is obligated to pay or provide in any other calendar year; (iii) the Covered Executive s right to have the Company pay or provide such reimbursements and in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit; and (iv) in no event shall the Company s obligations to make such reimbursements or to provide such in-kind benefits apply later than the periods described in this Policy. Within the time period permitted by the applicable Treasury Regulations, the Company may modify this Policy, in the least restrictive manner necessary and without any diminution in the value of the payments to the Covered Executive, in order to cause the provisions of this Policy to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of 
 7 

the Code, so as to avoid the imposition of taxes and penalties on the Covered Executive pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. 
 Notwithstanding anything in this Policy to the contrary, in the event that a Covered Executive is a specified employee (as defined in Section 409A of the Code) of the Company, as determined pursuant to the Company s policy for identifying specified employees, on the date of the Covered Executive s termination of employment and the Covered Executive is entitled to a payment and/or a benefit under this Policy that is required to be delayed pursuant to Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then such payment or benefit, as applicable, shall not be paid or provided (or begin to be paid or provided) until the first day of the seventh month following the date of the Covered Executive s termination of employment (or, if earlier, the date of the Covered Executive s death). The first payment that can be made to the Covered Executive following such period shall include the cumulative amount of any payments or benefits that could not be paid or provided during such period due to the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code. 
 3. Employment at Will 

Nothing in this Policy is to be construed such that a Covered Executive s employment with the Company is anything other than employment at will . 
 4. ERISA Provisions 

This Policy is intended to be a plan whose participation is limited to a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of Sections 4(b)(5), 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ). The claims procedure set forth in U.S. Department of Labor Regulation Section 2560.503-1 are incorporated by reference into this Policy. 
 5. Governing Law 

The rights and obligations of the Covered Executives and the Company under this Policy will be governed and interpreted in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Ohio without regard to choice of law principles and to the extent not preempted by ERISA. 
 8 

6. Integration 

This Policy supersedes and replaces the terms of any employment agreement, offer letter, or other agreement with the Company, including any agreement in respect of confidentiality, that governs the terms and conditions applicable to the Covered Executive s separation from the Company and is in effect immediately prior to the Covered Executive s termination of employment Alternative Agreement with respect to the payment of severance or benefits, to the extent that the Alternative Agreement provides for the payment of severance or benefits in an amount less than are payable under this Policy. To the extent that a Covered Executive is entitled to payment of severance or benefits under an Alternative Agreement in an amount greater than are payable under this Policy, the amount of severance or benefits shall be determined under the Alternative Agreement and the Covered Executive shall not be entitled to any payments of severance or benefits under this Policy. 
 For purposes of clarity, if a Covered Executive is or becomes a party to the Company s Change in Control Agreement dated effective as of November 7, 2013 (or any successor form of agreement in respect of a change in control, collectively, a Change in Control Agreement and is terminated under circumstances that would entitle the Covered Executive to payments and benefits under the Change in Control Agreement, the terms of the Change in Control Agreement, and not this Policy, will apply and the Covered Executive will not be eligible for the payment of severance or benefits under this Policy. 
 7. Reservation of Rights 

This Policy may be modified from time to time, or terminated in its entirety, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee. Any modifications made by the Compensation Committee for any Covered Executive will apply to all Covered Executives for purposes of this Policy (except to the extent expressly stated otherwise). Any modifications to, or the termination of, this Policy will not affect the rights of Covered Executives whose Termination Date preceded such modification or termination. The Compensation Committee will have discretion to construe and interpret this Policy and its decisions will be final and binding on the Company, the Covered Executive and all other interested persons. 
 8. Tax Withholding 

All payments to a Covered Executive under this Policy will be reduced by any required withholdings of applicable federal, state, local and foreign taxes. 
 9. Assignment 

The Covered Executive s rights and obligations under this Policy may not be assigned or transferred. The Company may not assign or transfer its obligations under this Agreement except in the event the Company is merged or consolidated into, or with, any other company, or if substantially all of the assets of the Company are transferred to another company. 
 10. Remedies for Breach 

Each party will bear its own costs to resolve any dispute arising under this Policy; provided, however, that in the event that a Covered Executive is determined to be the prevailing party in 
 9 

such dispute pursuant to a final non-appealable order or in a binding arbitration, the Company will reimburse the Covered Executive for the reasonable costs incurred to enforce this Policy, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees.
