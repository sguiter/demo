 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations, financial condition, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations, our market opportunity and the potential growth of that market, our liquidity and capital needs and other similar matters, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as anticipate, believe, contemplate, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, target, will, or would, or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations and assumptions about future events, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following: 
 
 our future financial performance, including our revenue, costs of revenue or expenses, or other operating results; 
 our ability to successfully execute our business and growth strategy; 
 anticipated trends and growth rates in our business and in the markets in which we operate; 
 our ability to effectively manage our growth and future expenses; 
 our anticipated investments in sales and marketing and research and development; 
 our ability to maintain the security and availability of our platform; 
 our ability to increase the number of customers using our platform;

 our ability to successfully defend litigation brought against us; 
 our ability to prevent and successfully remediate material weaknesses, if any, in internal controls over financial reporting; 
 the impact of global financial, economic, political, and health events, such as rising inflation, capital market disruptions, sanctions, or economic slowdowns or recessions, on our business and the restaurant industry; 
 our ability to source, finance, and integrate companies and assets that we have or may acquire; and 
 the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents and investments to meet our liquidity needs. 
 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors listed or described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

A Location can use Toast payment services, which we refer to as a Toast Processing Location, or for select enterprise customers, not use Toast s payment services, which we refer to as a Non-Toast Processing Location. Customers of legacy solutions provided by companies that we have acquired that do not use Toast POS, are not included in our Location count. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 127,000 Locations, an increase of 28 year over year, processing approximately 151 billion of gross payment volume in the trailing 12 months, partnered with Toast to optimize operations, increase sales, engage guests, and maintain happy employees. 
 
 Since our founding, we have translated our love for restaurants into a commitment to innovation and digital transformation for the restaurant industry. As we have expanded our platform, launched new products, and added new partners over time, we have rapidly grown the number of restaurant Locations on the Toast platform. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 We experience seasonality in our financial technology solutions revenue, which is largely driven by the level of Gross Payment Volume, or GPV, processed through our platform. For example, customers typically have greater sales during the warmer months, though this effect varies regionally, and customer sales can be impacted by seasonal needs of our customers (which may also impact the total number of Toast Processing Locations in such a period that contributes to our GPV). As a result, our financial technology solutions revenue per Toast Processing Location has historically been stronger in the second and third quarters. We believe that financial technology solutions revenue from both existing and potential future products will continue to represent a significant proportion of our overall revenue mix, and seasonality will continue to impact our results of operations.

Key Business Metrics 
 We use the following key business metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in billions) 2024 2023 Growth 2024 2023 Growth Gross Payment Volume (GPV) (1) 
 41.7 33.7 24 116.9 92.5 26 
 As of September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Growth Annualized Recurring Run-Rate (ARR) 1,554 1,218 28 
 Gross Payment Volume (GPV) (1) 
 Gross Payment Volume represents the sum of total dollars processed through the Toast payments platform across Toast Processing Locations in a given period. GPV is a key measure of the scale of our platform, which in turn drives our financial performance. As our customers generate more sales and therefore more GPV, we generally see higher financial technology solutions revenue. 
 _________________ 
 
 (1) Please note that numbers may not tie due to rounding to the nearest hundred million. 
 
 Annualized Recurring Run-Rate (ARR) 
 We monitor Annualized Recurring Run-Rate as a key operational measure of the scale of our subscription and payment processing services for both new and existing customers. To calculate this metric, we first calculate recurring run-rate on a monthly basis. Monthly Recurring Run-Rate, or MRR, is measured on the final day of each month as the sum of (i) our monthly billings of subscription services fees, which we refer to as the subscription component of MRR, and (ii) our in-month adjusted payments services fees, exclusive of estimated transaction-based costs, which we refer to as the payments component of MRR. MRR does not include fees derived from Toast Capital or related costs. MRR is also not burdened by the impact of SaaS credits offered. The MRR calculation includes all locations on the Toast platform and locations on legacy solutions, which have a negligible impact on ARR. 
 
 ARR is determined by taking the sum of (i) twelve times the subscription component of MRR and (ii) four times the trailing-three-month cumulative payments component of MRR. We believe this approach provides an indication of our scale, while also controlling for short-term fluctuations in payments volume. Our ARR may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers satisfaction with our platform, pricing, competitive offerings, economic conditions, or overall changes in our customers and their guests spending levels. ARR is an operational measure, does not reflect our revenue or gross profit determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, and should be viewed independently of, and not combined with or substituted for, our revenue, gross profit, and other financial information determined in accordance with GAAP. Further, ARR is not a forecast of future revenue and investors should not place undue reliance on ARR as an indicator of our future or expected results.

 The change in fair value of warrant liability for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by a combination of increased stock prices and a reduction of outstanding warrants from the Warrant Repurchase. The change in fair value of the warrant liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in the value of the common stock underlying the outstanding warrants at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use certain non-GAAP financial measures described below to supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered substitutes for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP metrics to provide investors insight into the information used by our management to evaluate our business and financial performance. We believe that these measures provide investors increased comparability of our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. 
 Net Income (Loss) (GAAP) and Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest income (expense) net, income taxes and certain other items that are not considered to reflect our operating activities and performance within the ordinary course of business, such as restructuring and restructuring-related expenses, acquisition expenses, fair value adjustments on warrant liabilities, gain on warrant extinguishments, expenses related to early termination of leases (which includes associated asset impairments), and stock-based charitable contribution expense, as applicable. We have provided below a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA. 
 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors in comparing our financial performance to other companies and from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and interest income, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on their financing and capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the impact of certain items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA also has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, although depreciation expense is a non-cash charge, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new asset acquisitions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. Adjusted EBITDA also does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces the cash available to us; or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. The expenses and other items that are excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their financial results. 
 
 The following table reflects the reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented:

 Subscription Services and Financial Technology Solutions Gross Profit (GAAP) and Non-GAAP Subscription Services and Financial Technology Solutions Gross Profit (Non-GAAP) 
 
 Non-GAAP Subscription Services and Financial Technology Solutions Gross Profit is defined as subscription services gross profit and financial technology solutions gross profit, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to view the resulting figures excluding the aforementioned non-cash charges because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and such amounts vary substantially from company to company depending on their financing and capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired. We have provided below a reconciliation of Subscription Services and Financial Technology Solutions Gross Profit, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Non-GAAP Subscription Services and Financial Technology Solutions Gross Profit for each of the periods presented.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (GAAP) and Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) 
 Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software costs (collectively referred to as capital expenditures). We believe that free cash flow is a meaningful indicator of our sources of liquidity and capital requirements that provides information to management and investors in evaluating the cash flow trends of our business. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth. 
 
 Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate free cash flow or similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently, which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison. In addition, free cash flow does not reflect mandatory debt service and other non-discretionary expenditures that are required to be made under contractual commitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for any given period.

 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 
 
 The net increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of 212 million (which excludes changes in the balance of restricted cash) and proceeds of 84 million generated from the issuance of common stock. This was partially offset by 61 million in cash outflows related to the Warrant Repurchase, 56 million in cash outflows related to share repurchases and 41 million in cash outflows related to capital expenditures. Cash generated from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by our net loss of (13) million, which includes restructuring and restructuring-related expenses of 46 million and a use of cash for working capital, primarily driven by higher deferred contract acquisition costs, resulting, in part, from continued growth in Locations. 
 24 

Table of Contents 

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year, was primarily driven by a lower net loss and an increase in non-cash adjustments, which was primarily attributable to increased fair value remeasurement loss of our warrant liability and increased amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs. This increase was partially offset by cash severance charges paid in connection with the Restructuring Plan and a higher use of cash for working capital. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year, was primarily driven by net cash inflows from marketable securities as compared to net cash outflows from marketable securities during the same period last year, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period last year, was primarily driven by cash outflows related to the Warrant Repurchase and share repurchases, partially offset by an increase in cash inflows from the proceeds from the issuance of common stock. 
 
 We do not anticipate any material changes, or material changes in trends, related to our net working capital requirements, liquidity or cash flows in the near term, other than for items disclosed within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Debt 
 During 2021 we entered into a senior secured credit facility, or the 2021 Facility, which we subsequently amended on March 2, 2023, to replace LIBOR with SOFR. The 2021 Facility is subject to a minimum liquidity covenant of 250 million, subject to certain additional customary restrictive covenants in connection with the February 2024 share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total available funds under the 2021 Facility were 330 million and no amounts were drawn or outstanding. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 5 million in letters of credit outstanding. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 In February 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock in an aggregate amount of up to 250 million. The repurchase program has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our Class A common stock, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of 56 million. 
 
 Dilution 
 
 We calculate our fully-diluted share count on an unweighted basis taking our total outstanding share count in addition to unexercised stock options, unvested restricted stock units, shares reserved for charitable donations and other securities that can be converted to common stock, such as our warrants to purchase common stock. As of September 30, 2024, our fully diluted share count was as follows: 
 
 (shares, in millions) 
 September 30, 2024 (1) 
 Class A and B common stock issued and outstanding 
 565 Options to purchase Class A common stock and Class B common stock 
 32 Unvested restricted stock units 
 25 Warrants to purchase Class B common stock 
 2 Shares reserved for charitable donations

 Other Capital Requirements 
 
 Expected working and other capital requirements are described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. At September 30, 2024, other than for the changes disclosed in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Quarterly Report, there have been no other material changes to our expected working and other capital requirements described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with our available borrowing capacity under our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next 12 months, including planned capital expenditures, strategic transactions, and investment commitments that we may enter into from time to time. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as credit risk on accounts receivable and our loan servicing activities. Our exposure to market and credit risk has not changed materially since the presentation set forth in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Control 
 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two, or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently a party to any litigation or claims that, if determined adversely to us, would have a material adverse effect on our business operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. We are, from time to time, party to litigation and subject to claims in the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of the defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the trading price of our Class A common stock. You should carefully read and consider the risks and uncertainties included in the Annual Report, together with all of the other information in the Annual Report and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, and other documents that we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described in these reports may not be the only ones we face. The factors discussed in these reports, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors, and oral statements. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 (a) Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 In September 2024, we issued and donated 0.2 million shares of Class A common stock in connection with our Pledge 1 commitment to an independent donor advised fund to further our philanthropic goals through our Toast.org initiative, for consideration consisting of the benefit to the Company related to the purpose of the independent donor advised fund. The offer, sale, and issuance of the securities were deemed to be exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering.

 2. Coverage . For purposes of this Policy, Covered Employees shall mean certain employees of the Company based in the United States at the executive level (senior vice presidents and above) listed on Appendix A and who have signed a Severance Policy Eligibility and Waiver under this Policy provided by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a Covered Employee is party to an employment or letter agreement with the Company or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, an Employment Agreement that provides for severance and or accelerated vesting upon a termination of employment, then the payments and benefits under such Employment Agreement shall supersede this policy unless such payments and benefits under such Employment Agreement are expressly waived. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall there be a duplication of payments or benefits under this Policy and any Employment Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any person who is classified by the Company as an independent contractor or third-party employee is not a Covered Employee and is not eligible for severance benefits or accelerated vesting under this Policy even if such classification is modified retroactively. 
 3. Change in Control . A Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of any one of the following events (a) the sale or exclusive out-license of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis to an unrelated person or entity, (b) a merger, reorganization or consolidation pursuant to which the holders of the Company s outstanding voting power and outstanding stock immediately prior to such transaction do not own a majority of the outstanding voting power and fair market value of the stock or other equity interests of the resulting or successor entity (or its ultimate parent, if applicable) immediately upon completion of such transaction, (c) the sale of all of the stock of the Company to an unrelated person, entity or group thereof acting in concert, or (d) any other transaction in which the owners of the Company s outstanding voting power immediately prior to such transaction do not own at least a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Company or any successor entity immediately upon completion of the transaction other than as a result of the acquisition of securities directly from the Company (for the avoidance of doubt, any change in majority voting power resulting from the conversion of Class B common stock of the Company to Class A common stock of the Company by an individual stockholder shall not, on its own, constitute a Change in Control). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy, Change in Control shall be interpreted, administered and applied in a manner consistent and in compliance with a change in control event as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A- 3(i)(5). 

Change in Control Period shall mean the period consisting of the 3 months immediately prior to a Change in Control and the 12 months immediately following a Change in Control.

For purposes hereof, the Covered Employee will be considered Disabled if, as a result of the Employee s incapacity due to physical or mental illness, the Covered Employee shall have been absent from his or her duties to the Company on a full-time basis for 180 calendar days in the aggregate in any 12-month period.

The provisions of this Section 5(b) shall apply in lieu of, and expressly supersede, the provisions of Section 5(a) if a Termination Event occurs within a Change in Control Period provided that, if the Company has commenced providing severance pay and benefits to the Covered Employee under Section 5(a) prior to the date the Covered Employee becomes eligible to receive severance pay and benefits under this Section 5(b), the severance pay and benefits previously provided to the Covered Employee under Section 5(a) shall reduce the severance pay and benefits to be provided under this Section 5(b).

 2. Accelerated Vesting . 
 (a) In the event that a Covered Employee experiences a Termination Event outside of a Change in Control Period and the Covered Employee has signed the Separation Agreement and Release (and such Separation Agreement and Release has become irrevocable within the time period set forth in Section 5(a) of this Policy), and is entitled to the benefits under Section 5(a), then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any applicable option agreement or stock-based award agreement, the portion of the Covered Employee s time-based stock options and other time-based stock-based awards that would have vested during the 6- month period following the Termination Event had the Covered Employee s employment with the Company continued during such period shall immediately accelerate and become fully exercisable or nonforfeitable as of the Covered Employee s Date of Termination.

 3. Additional Limitation. 
 (a) Anything in this Policy to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that 

the amount of any compensation, payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Covered Employee, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Policy or otherwise, calculated in a manner consistent with Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code and the applicable regulations thereunder (the Compensatory Payments ), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, (or any successor provision), then the Compensatory Payments shall be reduced so that the sum of all of the Compensatory Payments shall be 1.00 less than the amount at which the Covered Employee becomes subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision) provided that such reduction shall only occur if it would result in the Covered Employee receiving a higher After Tax Amount (as defined below) than the Covered Employee would receive if the Compensatory Payments were not subject to such reduction. In such event, the Compensatory Payments shall be reduced in the following order, in each case, in reverse chronological order beginning with the Compensatory Payments that are to be paid the furthest in time from consummation of the transaction that is subject to Section 280G of the Code (i) cash payments not subject to Section 409A of the Code (ii) cash payments subject to Section 409A of the Code (iii) equity-based payments and acceleration and 
 (iv) non-cash forms of benefits provided that in the case of all the foregoing Compensatory Payments all amounts or payments that are not subject to calculation under Treas. Reg. 1.280G- 1, Q&A-24(b) or (c) shall be reduced before any amounts that are subject to calculation under Treas. Reg. 1.280G-1, Q&A-24(b) or (c). 
 (b) For purposes of this Section 7, the After Tax Amount means the amount of the Compensatory Payments less all federal, state, and local income, excise and employment taxes imposed on the Covered Employee as a result of the Covered Employee s receipt of the Compensatory Payments. For purposes of determining the After Tax Amount, the Covered Employee shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation applicable to individuals for the calendar year in which the determination is to be made, and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rates of individual taxation in each applicable state and locality, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. 
 (c) The determination as to whether a reduction in the Compensatory Payments shall be made pursuant to Section 7(a) shall be made by an accounting firm selected by the Company (the Accounting Firm ), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Covered Employee within 15 business days of the Date of Termination, if applicable, or at such earlier time as is reasonably requested by the Company or the Covered Employee. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Covered Employee. 
 4. Section 409A. 
 (a) Anything in this Policy to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of the Covered Employee s separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the Company determines that the Covered Employee is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Covered Employee becomes entitled to under this Policy on account of the Covered Employee s separation from service would be considered deferred compensation subject to the 

20 percent additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such payment shall not be payable and such benefit shall not be provided until the date that is the earlier of (A) six months and one day after the Covered Employee s separation from service, or (B) the Covered Employee s death. 
 (b) It is intended that this Policy will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any provision of this Policy is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner so as not to be part of this Policy or in compliance with Section 409A of the Code so that all payments hereunder are either exempt or comply with Section 409A of the Code. Each payment pursuant to this Policy is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of applying Section 409A, any exemptions thereto and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). 
 (c) To the extent that any payment or benefit described in this Policy constitutes non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and to the extent that such payment or benefit is payable upon the Covered Employee s termination of employment, then such payments or benefits shall be payable only upon the Covered Employee s separation from service. The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). 
 (d) The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Covered Employee or any other person if any provisions of this Policy are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section.

 (b) Board shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company. 
 (c) Date of Termination shall mean the date that a Covered Employee s employment with the Company ends. 
 (d) Effective Date shall mean August 1, 2024. 
 6. Withholding . All payments made by the Company to a Covered Employee under this Policy shall be net of any tax or other amounts required to be withheld by the Company under applicable law. 
 7. No Mitigation . If a Termination Event occurs and a Covered Employee is eligible for the benefits set forth in this Policy, the Covered Employee is not required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to the Covered Employee by the Company pursuant to this Policy. Further, the amount of any payment provided for in this Policy shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by the Covered 

Employee as the result of employment by another employer. 
 8. Policy Administration . The general administration of the Policy and the responsibility for carrying out its provisions shall be vested in the Administrator. The Administrator shall have such powers and authority as are necessary to discharge such duties and responsibilities which also include, but are not limited to, interpretation and construction of the Policy, the determination of all questions of fact, including, without limitation, eligibility, participation and benefits, the resolution of any ambiguities and all other related or incidental matters, and such duties and powers of the Policy administration which are not assumed from time to time by any other appropriate entity, individual or institution. The Administrator may adopt rules and regulations of uniform applicability in its interpretation and implementation of the Policy. 
 The Administrator shall discharge its duties and responsibilities and exercise its powers and authority in its sole discretion and in accordance with the terms of the controlling legal documents and applicable law, and its actions and decisions that are not arbitrary and capricious shall be binding on any employee, the employee s spouse or other dependent or beneficiary and any other interested parties whether or not in being or under a disability. Not in limitation, but in amplification of the foregoing, the Administrator shall have the power and authority in its discretion to 
 (a) construe the Policy to determine all questions that shall arise as to interpretations of the Policy s provisions 
 (b) determine which individuals are and are not Covered Employees, determine the benefits to which any Covered Employees may be entitled, the eligibility requirements for participation in the Policy and all other matters pertaining to the Policy 
 (c) adopt amendments to the Policy which are deemed necessary or desirable to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to Section 409A of the Code and the guidance thereunder 
 (d) make all determinations it deems advisable for the administration of the Policy, including the authority and ability to delegate administrative functions to a third party 
 (e) decide all disputes arising in connection with the Policy and 
 (f) otherwise supervise the administration of the Policy. 
 All decisions and interpretations of the Administrator shall be conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company and Covered Employees. 
 9. Indemnification . To the extent permitted by law, all officers, directors, agents and representatives of the Company shall be indemnified by the Company and held harmless against any claims and the expenses of defending against such claims resulting from any action or conduct relating to the administration of the Policy, whether as a member of the Board or a 

committee thereof or otherwise, except to the extent that such claims arise from gross negligence, willful neglect, or willful misconduct. 
 10. Unfunded Policy . This Policy shall be unfunded and shall not create (or be construed to create) a trust or separate fund. Likewise, the Policy shall not establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates and any Covered Employee. 
 11. Policy Not an Employment Contract . This Policy is not a contract between the Company and any employee, nor is it a condition of employment of any employee. Nothing contained in the Policy gives, or is intended to give, any employee the right to be retained in the service of the Company, or to interfere with the right of the Company to discharge or terminate the employment of any employee at any time and for any reason. No employee shall have the right or claim to benefits beyond those expressly provided in this Policy, if any. All rights and claims are limited as set forth in the Policy. 
 12. Enforceability . If any portion or provision of this Policy (including, without limitation, any portion or provision of any Section of this Policy) shall to any extent be declared illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remainder of this Policy, or the application of such portion or provision in circumstances other than those as to which it is so declared illegal or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each portion and provision of this Policy shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
 13. Non-Assignability by Covered Employee Assignability by Company . No right or interest of any Covered Employee in the Policy shall be assignable or transferable in whole or in part either directly or by operation of law or otherwise, including, but not limited to, execution, levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge or bankruptcy. In the event of the Covered Employee s death after a Termination Event but prior to the completion by the Company of all payments due him or her under this Policy, the Company shall continue such payments to the Covered Employee s beneficiary designated in writing to the Company prior to her death (or to her estate, if the Employee fails to make such designation). The Company may assign or otherwise transfer this Policy to any other person or entity without any Covered Employee s consent. 
 14. Integration With Other Pay or Benefits Requirements. The Severance Benefits provided for in the Policy are the maximum benefits that the Company will pay to Covered Employees upon a Termination Event. To the extent that the Company owes any amounts in the nature of severance benefits to any Covered Employee under any other program, policy or plan of the Company that is not otherwise superseded by this Policy, or to the extent that any federal, state or local law, including, without limitation, so-called plant closing laws, requires the Company to give advance notice or make a payment of any kind to an employee because of that Covered Employee s involuntary termination due to a layoff, reduction in force, plant or facility closing, sale of business, or similar event, the benefits provided under this Policy or the other arrangement shall either be reduced or eliminated to avoid any duplication of payment. The Company intends for the benefits provided under this Policy to partially or fully satisfy any and all statutory obligations that may arise out of a Covered Employee s involuntary 

termination for the foregoing reasons and the Company shall so construe and implement the terms of the Policy. 
 15. Amendment or Termination . The Board may amend, modify or terminate the Policy at any time in its sole discretion provided, however, that (i) any such amendment, modification or termination that may adversely affect the rights of any Covered Employee shall be approved by a majority of the Company s Board provided that no such amendment, modification or termination may be made following a Change in Control without the consent of any such adversely affected person, and (ii) no such amendment, modification or termination may affect the rights of a Covered Employee then receiving payments or benefits under the Policy without the consent of such person. 
 16. Governing Law . This Policy and the rights of all persons under this Policy shall be construed in accordance with and under applicable provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to conflict of laws provisions). This Policy is not intended to be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. 
 17. Successor to Company. The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company expressly to assume and agree to perform this Policy to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no succession had taken place.
