 On July 28, 2016, the Company executed the convertible promissory note #1 in the principal amount of 15,000, which is in default but management has not been able to make contact with this party, due to them living out of the country. The due date for this note was January 19, 2017 at an interest rate of 8 , with a default interest rate of 18 . We have calculated the derivative liability as if it is in default (but the note s default interest rate stays the same at 8 and will still accrue appropriate interest until the note is fully satisfied or converted into the Company s common stock. The conversion option for this note coverts at a 54 discount to the market price based on the lowest trading prices in the last 20 days trading period. The outstanding balance on convertible promissory note #1 as of September 30, 2024 was 6,750. 
 
 The fair value of the derivative as of September 30, 2024 was determined to be 24,061 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions: common share price of 3.40 per share; expected exercise price of 1.904 per share; volatility of 222 ; expected dividend yield of zero; and annual risk-free interest rate of 4.82 . The derivatives are classified as liabilities as they represent an obligation to deliver a variable number of shares of common stock in the future and are therefore required to be initially and subsequently measured at fair value each reporting period. The Company originally recorded a derivative liability in the amount of 9,649. The fair value of the derivative liability is remeasured each reporting period using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the change in fair value is recorded as an adjustment to the derivative liabilities account with the unrealized gains or losses reflect in other income change in fair value on derivative. 
 
 Convertible promissory note #2: 
 On May 25, 2022, the Company executed the convertible promissory note #2 in the principal amount of 154,000 with a loan origination fee in the amount of 15,400, which was fully expensed as interest expense in this period. The net proceeds from this note were 138,600. The loan is unsecured and the initial repayment of 14,488 was due on October 5, 2022. There will be ten additional monthly payments due on the 5 th day of each following month, beginning on November 5, 2022 through August 5, 2023. Interest will accrual at an interest rate of 10 per annum on any unpaid principal amount. If the Company defaults on the loan, the default interest will increase to 16 per annum. During 2022, the Company has made principal payments totaling 43,465 towards the outstanding balance on convertible promissory note #2. During 2023, the Company has made additional principal payments towards convertible promissory note #2 totaling 110,535 which settled the entire principal balance in full.

ITEM 2 M a nagement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Our Management s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 Although the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Statement reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, its unaudited financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a platform for acquiring, developing, patenting, marketing, and distributing plant-based nutraceuticals. Our products have not been evaluated by the FDA or any similar regulatory body for safety and efficacy. Our proprietary and patented products target select high-growth categories within the multibillion-dollar nutraceuticals market, such as heart, brain and immune health. Our mission is to acquire or create products with health and performance benefits that have mass consumer appeal. 
 
 Guided by this mission, our first two acquisitions formed our current operating subsidiaries, BergaMet NA, LLC, which offers nutraceutical heart and immune health products, and UBN, which offers nutraceutical products for brain health. Based on published research from third-party sources, we believe our BergaMet NA, LLC products have been shown to support heart health, support immune response, and address metabolic syndrome. 
 
 Our Financial Condition and Going Concern Issues 
 
 As a result of our financial condition, we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. From inception (December 19, 2014) through the end of December 31, 2023, we have incurred accumulated net losses of 18,399,673. In order to continue as a going concern, we must effectively balance many factors and generate more revenue so that we can fund our operations from our sales and revenues. If we are not able to do this, we may not be able to continue as an operating company. At our current revenue and burn rate, we have an immediate cash need, and thus we must raise capital by issuing debt or through the sale of our stock. However, there is no assurance that our existing cash flow will be adequate to satisfy our existing operating expenses and capital requirements.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Introduction 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had positive operating cash flows. Our cash on hand as of December 31, 2023 was 19,441 and as of September 30, 2024 was 100,402. While we had positive net cash from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our monthly cash flow burn rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 35,000. We have both short- and medium-term cash needs. We anticipate that these needs will be satisfied through increased revenues and the issuance of debt or the sale of our securities until such time as our cash flows from operations will satisfy our cash flow needs. 
 27 
 
 Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, are as follows:

Our total current assets and total assets decreased slightly during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of our decrease in inventory of 188,801, offset in part by an increase in cash of 80,961. Our accumulated deficit increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, by 393,742 to 18,793,415. 
 
 In order to repay our obligations in full or in part when due, we will be required to raise significant capital from other sources. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts. 
 
 Cash Requirements 
 
 Our cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 was 100,402. Based on our current level of revenues and monthly burn rate for 2023 of approximately 35,000 per month, we will need to continue to fund operations by raising capital from the sale of our stock and debt financings. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 We had net cash from operating activities of 240,090 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities of (471,373) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We use our cash for normal business operations. Our net cash from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted of our net loss of 393,742, offset in part by our change in fair value on derivative liability of 273,436, warrants issued for services of 247,513, and our decrease in inventory of 188,801.

 ITEM 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.

 ITEM 4 Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities Exchange Commission s rules and forms, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses identified and described in our Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Our principal executive officers do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officers have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 No change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report, the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1 Legal Proceedings 
 
 There are no updates to the disclosure of legal proceedings in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. The litigation process is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. However, in the opinion of our management, other than as set forth herein, matters currently pending or threatened against us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
