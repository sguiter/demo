Overview 

Sustainable
Projects Group Inc. SPGX, we, us, our or the Company is a pure-play
lithium company focused on supplying high performance lithium compounds to the fast-growing electric vehicle and broader
battery markets. We have developed a proprietary technology to extract lithium from oilfield wastewater, which we believe will enable
us to manufacture lithium compounds quickly, at an attractive cost, and with a minimal environmental footprint, which we expect to provide
us with a competitive advantage over other lithium manufacturers. We believe this competitive advantage will enable us to capitalize
on the acceleration of vehicle electrification and renewable energy adoption. 

We have largely
completed the environmental and construction permitting stage and plan to start physical construction of our first two lithium
carbonate manufacturing facilities in North Dakota in the first quarter of 2025, which we anticipate will be capable of
manufacturing up to a total of 2,800 metric tons of lithium carbonate, and we plan to begin manufacturing battery-grade lithium
compounds at such facilities in the second half of 2025. We plan to continue to invest in manufacturing capacity and aim to have a
total manufacturing capacity of approximately 6,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate by the end of 2026. No assurance can be given
that we will be able to establish such facilities or begin manufacturing within this timeframe or at all. 

On February 14, 2023, we entered into the Exchange
Agreement with Lithium Harvest and all of the Shareholders. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all
of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Lithium Harvest in exchange for issuing to the Shareholders 206,667,233 shares of our common
stock. The Exchange Transaction closed on February 14, 2023. 

Prior
to the Exchange Transaction, we were a business development company engaged in project development and holdings through value-based investments
and collaborative partnerships, including a joint venture relationship with Hero Wellness Systems Inc. Hero Wellness and a purchase agreement with the inventors of the Soy-yer Dough product line. During September 2022, we decided to exit the joint venture
with Hero Wellness, and following the Exchange Transaction, we have not made final plans on the Soy-yer Dough project. We impaired our
intangible assets associated with this project as of December 31, 2021. 

Recent Developments 

On September 27, 2024, the Company issued 2,278,723
shares of common stock valued at 797,500 to accredited investors in a private placement subscription at 0.35 per share.

Results
of Operations 

Quarter
Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 

Operating
Expenses . The Company s operating expenses
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,022,002 as compared to 921,026 for the same time period of the prior
fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses can be primarily attributed to an increase in consulting fees, which increased from
 43,763 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 475,588 for the same period during the year 2024. Another factor
impacting operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was foreign exchange fees, which accounted for a gain
of 97,877 as compared to 5,539 during the same period in 2023. Additionally, we saw an increase in research and
development fees, which increased from 0 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 23,840 during the same period in 2024. An additional factor was an increase in office maintenance and utilities, which increased from 39,939 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023 to 58,778 for the same time period in 2024, related to the expenses of our Denmark
office. 

We saw several offsetting
factors, which significantly decreased in cost year over year. The largest offsetting contributor was stock based payments, which decreased
from 164,236 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 0 for the same time period during 2024 as a result of the
termination of the Incentive Plan Additionally, we saw
a decrease in wages and salaries, which decreased from 169,176 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 137,670 during
the same time period during 2024. The Company also saw a significant decrease in travel expenses, which decreased from 47,133 during
the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 17,708, largely attributable to the re-location of our CEO to the United States. 

Miscellaneous
Income . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had miscellaneous income of 90,223 compared to 78,175
during the same prior fiscal year period. This increase in miscellaneous income was attributable to income from sub-leases of office
space at our Denmark office. 

Net Loss . During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of 932,599, compared to a net loss of 843,734 in the same prior fiscal year period. The
increased net loss was largely attributable to higher consulting expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to the same period during the year 2023. Additionally, we saw an increase in research and development fees, which increased from 0 during
the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 23,840 during the same period in 2024. An additional factor was an increase in office maintenance
and utilities, which increased from 39,939 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 58,778 for the same time period in 2024,
related to the expenses of our Denmark office. 

We saw several offsetting
factors, which significantly decreased in cost year over year. The largest offsetting contributor was stock based payments, which decreased
from 164,236 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 0 for the same time period during 2024 as a result of the termination
of the Incentive Plan. Additionally, we saw a decrease in wages and salaries, which decreased from 169,176 during the three-month period
ended September 30, 2023 to 137,670 during the same time period during 2024. The Company also saw a significant decrease in travel expenses,
which decreased from 47,133 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 17,708, largely attributable to the re-location of
our CEO to the United States. 

Translation (Loss) Gain. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a translation loss of 120,635 as compared
to a translation gain of 23,867 during the same period during the year 2023. Translation gains and losses stem from variability in
the exchange rate between U.S. Dollars and Danish Krone. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Operating
Expenses . The Company s operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,640,186 as compared
to 2,175,394 for the same time period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses can be primarily attributed to consulting
expenses. Consulting expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 477,598 as compared to 104,984 during the same period
in the prior year. Additionally, the increase in operating expenses was affected by a significant increase in management fees, which
increased to 691,323 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 599,089 in the corresponding period for the year
2023. The third major driver of operating expenses was increased office maintenance utilities, which increased from 76,055 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 147,212 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

We saw several offsetting factors, which significantly
decreased in cost year over year. The largest offsetting contributor was stock based payments, which decreased from 328,472 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 148,195 for the same time period during 2024. Additionally, we saw a decrease in rent expense,
which decreased from 57,799 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 0 during the same time period during 2024. The
Company also saw a significant decrease in foreign exchange costs, which amounted to 36,686 during the nine months ended September 30,
2023, versus a gain of 17,953 during the corresponding period in 2024.

Miscellaneous
Income . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had miscellaneous income of 260,120, compared to 169,566
during the same prior fiscal year period. This increase in miscellaneous income was attributable to income from sub-leases of office
space at our Denmark office. 

Net Loss . During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of 2,382,506, compared to a net loss of 2,006,459 in the same prior fiscal year period.
The increased loss was generally attributable to increased expenses in ramping up our business activities following the reverse acquisition
of Lithium Harvest. As disclosed above, the increase in net loss can be primarily attributed to consulting expenses. Consulting expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 477,598 as compared to 104,984 during the same period in 2024. Additionally, the increase
in operating expenses was affected by a significant increase in management fees, which increased to 691,323 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 as compared to 599,089 in the corresponding period for 2023. The third major driver of operating expenses was increased
office maintenance and utilities, which increased from 76,055 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 147,212 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. 

We saw several offsetting factors, which significantly decreased in cost
year over year. The largest offsetting contributor was stock based payments, which decreased from 328,472 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 to 148,195 for the same time period during 2024. Additionally, we saw a decrease in rent expense, which decreased
from 57,799 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 0 during the same time period during 2024. The Company also saw
a significant decrease in foreign exchange costs, which amounted to 36,686 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, versus a
gain of 17,953 during the corresponding period in 2024. 

Translation (Loss) Gain. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a translation loss of 53,204 as
compared to a translation gain of 12,010 during the same period during the year 2023. Translation gains and losses stem from
variability in the exchange rate between U.S. Dollars and Danish Krone. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 602,136, compared to a cash balance of 847,724 at December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash balance
was primarily due to increasing operating expenses as disclosed above. During the 12-month period following the date of this report,
management anticipates that the Company will not generate sufficient revenues to continue the development of current projects and projects
in the pipeline. Accordingly, the Company will be required to obtain additional financing in order to continue its plan of operations.
Management may attempt to secure debt financing for future growth, but due to the absence of meaningful assets and limited operating
history, debt financing may not be available to the Company. Management anticipates that additional funding will be in the form of equity
financing from the sale of the Company s common stock, as well as debt if available. If we are successful in completing an equity
financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in the Company. However, the Company does not have any financing
arranged and cannot provide investors with any assurance that it will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of its common
stock to fund its plan of operations. In the absence of such financing, the Company will not be able to develop its products or facilities
and its business plan will fail. Even if the Company is successful in obtaining equity financing and developing its business, additional
development of its lithium extraction facilities will be required. If the Company does not continue to obtain additional financing, it
will be forced to abandon its business and plan of operations. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had total assets of 2,557,550,
and a working capital deficit of 1,187,913, compared with total assets of 3,069,604 and a working capital deficit of 205,103 at December
31, 2023. The increase in the working capital deficit was primarily due to a significant decrease in cash from 847,724 on December 31,
2023 to 602,136 on September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company saw a decrease in pre-paid expenses from 398,067 at December 31, 2023
to 297,823 at September 30, 2024. The increase in working capital deficit was also driven by increased amounts due to related parties
as well as accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease in payroll liabilities. 

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
net cash used in operating activities was 702,951 compared to 699,630 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
in cash used in operating activities was primarily related to the expansion of business activities following the reverse acquisition
of Lithium Harvest. The largest drivers of this increase in net cash used in operating activities were shares issued for services
and prepaid expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 shares issued for services were 474,223 as compared to 0 during
the same period in 2023. Additionally, prepaid expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were an increase of 100,244 as
compared to a decrease of 210,376 in the corresponding period for 2023. The third major driver of net cash used in operating
activities was an increase in notes payable to a related party, which increased from 0 for the nine months ending September 30,
2023 to 248,715 for the same period during 2024. 

We saw several offsetting factors, such as a
decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as payroll liabilities. Additions to accounts payable for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 were 46,397 as compared to 411,426 during the same period in 2023. Additional payroll liabilities
decreased by 130,739 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an addition of 190,714 during the same period in
2023. Additionally, stock based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 148,195 as compared to 328,472 for
the same period in 2023. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 28,638 compared to 161,734 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to decreased spending for office equipment
and the completion of our website design process. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net
cash flow provided by financing activities was 531,361 as compared with 1,858,124 generated for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was due to common stock issued in a private
placement of shares, partially offset by an increase in lease payments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided
by financing activities was primarily due to common stock issued in private placements and subscriptions for in-process private placements,
partially offset by the issuance of common stock in the Exchange Transaction.

Going
Concern 

We
have limited operations and have sustained operating losses resulting in a deficit. In view of these matters, realization values may
be substantially different from carrying values as shown. We have accumulated a deficit of 5,742,263 since inception and have yet to
achieve profitable operations and further losses are anticipated in the development of our business. Our ability to continue as a going
concern is in substantial doubt and is dependent upon obtaining additional financing and/or achieving a sustainable profitable level
of operations. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
We had 602,136 in cash as of September 30, 2024. Cash used by operations was 702,951 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
We will need to raise additional cash in order to fund ongoing operations over the next 12 months. We expect to finance our operations
through public or private equity, debt or other available financing transactions. However, there is no assurance that such additional
funds will be available for us on acceptable terms, if at all. 

Inflation 

While
inflation has eased significantly globally, management anticipates continued inflation in all areas of operations. High rates of inflation
could impact the Company s development costs for its first production plant expected to be operational in the second half of 2025.
During the construction of our first production plant, we expect to rely on the delivery of certain components from third party vendors,
such as filtration equipment, piping and other goods. We cannot rule out that inflation could affect the cost of these components during
the construction process, leading to increased development costs. Additionally, the Company could suffer from negative effects from wage
inflation. We anticipate increasing our number of employees for the construction and operation phase of our first lithium production
plant. Wage inflation could lead to higher than anticipated employee expenses during this hiring process. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated interim financial statements and the reported amounts
of expenses during the reporting period. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical
trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance
with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. 

A
critical accounting estimate is defined as a financial statement item where significant judgment is required in the selection of accounting
policies and the determination of estimates. The accounting estimates that require more significant judgment are included below: 

1. 
 Revenue
 recognition: We use judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. This judgment
 is based on the timing of delivery, customer acceptance and other factors. Our revenue recognition policies are subject to periodic
 review and changes, and any changes could have a material impact on our financial statements. 

2. 
 Allowance
 for doubtful accounts: We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical data, current economic conditions and
 other factors. The actual amount of uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates, and any significant changes could impact
 our financial statements. 

3. 
 Inventory
 valuation: We estimate the value of inventory based on historical cost, estimated future demand and other factors. We regularly review
 our inventory and may write down the value if it is deemed to be obsolete or overvalued. Any significant changes to our inventory
 valuation could impact our financial statements. 

4. 
 Depreciation
 and amortization: We estimate the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and the residual values
 used in our depreciation and amortization calculations. Our estimates are subject to change based on economic conditions, technological
 advancements and other factors, and any changes could have a material impact on our financial statements. 

5. 
 Impairment
 of long-lived assets: We periodically review our long-lived assets for impairment and estimate the fair value of those assets. Our
 estimates are based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and future plans for the assets. If the estimated fair value
 of the assets is lower than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment charge. Any changes to our estimates could result in impairment
 charges and have a material impact on our financial statements. 

6. 
 Exchange
 rates and translational risks: We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations and translational risks, particularly with respect to
 the Danish Krone. We estimate the impact of these fluctuations on our financial statements and make adjustments as necessary. The
 fluctuations in exchange rates could have a significant impact on the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
 currencies, and on our results of operations when translating these amounts into our functional currency. Any material changes in
 exchange rates could have a significant impact on our financial statements.

4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

In
connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by the Company s management,
with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Based
on that evaluation, the Company s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting
described below. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

A
material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. 

Page 7 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board were: 

(1)
We currently lack a functioning audit committee and lack a majority of outside directors on the Company s board of directors, resulting
in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; 

(2)
We currently have inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; 

(3)
We have insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application
of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and 

(4)
We have ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. 

Due
to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

The
above mentioned material weaknesses (1), (2), (3) and (4) contributed to additional material weaknesses: 

(5)
We have ineffective controls over timely impairments of intangible assets; and 

(6)
We lack internal control over financial reporting in the controls over the accounting treatment of subsequent events. 

Material
weaknesses (1), (2), (3) and (4), which were originally identified by the Company s Chief Financial Officer in connection with
fiscal year 2021 financial results, were not remediated and therefore remained ineffective at September 30, 2024. Material weaknesses
(5) and (6) were identified by the Company s Chief Financial Officer in connection with the re-audit of its financial statements
as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, were not remediated and therefore remained ineffective at September 30, 2024. 

The
Company is committed to improving its financial organization. As part of this commitment and when funds are available, the Company intends
to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and increase its personnel resources and technical accounting
expertise within the accounting function by: 

(i) 
 appointing
 three or more outside directors to its board of directors who will also be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting
 in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
 control over financial reporting; 

(ii) 
 preparing
 and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists that will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting
 with respect to the requirements and application of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; 

(iii) 
 preparing
 and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists that will set forth procedures for the treatment of impairment for intangible
 assets with respect to the requirements and application of GAAP; and 

(iv) 
 preparing
 and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists that will set forth procedures for the treatment of subsequent events
 with respect to the requirements and application of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

Page 8 

Management
believes that the appointment of three or more outside directors, who will also be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee,
will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s Board. In
addition, management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material
weaknesses: 

(i) 
 insufficient
 written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of GAAP and
 SEC disclosure requirements; 

(ii) 
 ineffective
 controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes; 

(iii) 
 ineffective
 controls over required impairments of intellectual assets; and 

(iv) 
 lack
 of internal control over financial reporting in the controls over the accounting treatment of subsequent events. 

Further,
management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have technical expertise and knowledge will result in proper segregation
of duties and provide more checks and balances within the Company s finance department. The Company expects additional personnel
will also provide the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turnover issues occur within the finance department. 

Management
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing
basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.
The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until management completes the design and implementation of the measures described
above, until the controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and until management has concluded, through testing, that the controls
are effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes (other than as described above) in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

Management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s controls and procedures,
even when and if all material weaknesses have been remediated, will prevent all potential error and fraud. A control system, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
