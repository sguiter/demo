 Service-based Restricted Stock Units 
 The Company grants service-based RSUs to its employees and non-employee directors, which generally vest over a period of three to four years. The fair values of service-based RSUs are based on the fair value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted service-based RSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value of per share. 
 Performance Stock Units 
 The Company s PSUs granted in 2023 vest over a period of three years, subject to the employee s continued employment through the vesting date and satisfaction of certain pre-established performance targets based on Company financial metrics. Expense related to these PSUs is recognized ratably during the 3-year performance period, based on the probability of attaining the performance targets. The potential number of shares that may be earned is determined based on achievement of performance targets up to a maximum of 100 of the number of PSUs granted. 
 In June 2024, the Company granted market-based PSU awards to its senior executives, which are earned subject to achievement of specified stock price hurdles for 20 days out of a 30-trading day window during the 3-year performance period, as well as continued employment through the quarterly vesting dates over the 3-year period. The number of shares that are eligible to vest range from 0 to 100 of the number of PSUs granted based on achievement of the specified stock price hurdles, with half of our CEO s PSU award subject to vesting based on two additional above-target stock price hurdles. 
 The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation, which uses subjective assumptions and simulates multiple stock price paths of the Company's common stock to determine the fair value of market-based PSUs on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized using an accelerated attribution method over the greater of the derived service periods and explicit quarterly service periods. Compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether the market condition will be ultimately satisfied.

 Recent Developments 
 Repurchase of Outstanding Convertible Notes 
 On September 19, 2024, we repurchased the remaining 118.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.95 Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Convertible Notes out of the initially issued principal balance of 236.0 million via a privately negotiated repurchase agreement with Baupost Group Securities, L.L.C., the sole holder of the Convertible Notes, for approximately 109.7 million in cash, including accrued interest, representing a discount of approximately 7.5 to the principal amount of the repurchased notes.

Following the closing of the repurchase, the repurchased notes were cancelled by The Bank of New York Mellon (the Trustee ), and there were no Convertible Notes outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 Share Purchase Agreement 
 On August 1, 2024, we entered into a definitive share purchase agreement (the Agreement with Altice Teads S.A. (the Seller or Altice ), a public limited liability company (soci t anonyme) incorporated and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the sole shareholder of Teads S.A., a public limited liability company (soci t anonyme) incorporated and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Teads ), and Teads.

 30 

The Agreement provides for the following consideration to be paid to the Seller at closing of the Transaction (the Closing ): (1) a cash payment of 725.0 million, subject to certain customary adjustments as set forth in the Agreement (the Cash Consideration ), (2) 35.0 million newly issued shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.001 (the Common Stock such newly issued shares of Common Stock, the Consideration Common Stock ), and (3) 10.5 million newly issued shares of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value 0.001 (the Series A Preferred Stock and, together with the Consideration Common Stock, the Consideration Stock ).

 See Notes 3 and 10 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Transaction. 
 Conditions in Israel 
 Many of our employees, including certain members of our management team and board of directors, operate from Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may directly affect our business and operations. In October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s border with the Gaza strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in extensive deaths, injuries and the kidnapping of civilians and soldiers. In response, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against this terrorist organization commenced in parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks. In addition, since the commencement of these events, there have been continued hostilities along Israel s northern border with Lebanon with the Hezbollah terror organization, along the Red Sea (a vital maritime route for international trade to Israel) with the Houthis of Yemen, and on other fronts, including with various rebel militia groups in Syria and Iraq. Israel has carried out a number of targeted strikes on sites belonging to these terror organizations, and in October 2024, Israel began limited ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon. In addition, Iran recently launched direct attacks on Israel involving hundreds of drones and missiles and has threatened to continue to attack Israel. Israel has responded by launching direct attacks against certain targets in Iran. These situations may escalate in the future into more violent events or greater regional conflict which may affect Israel and us. 
 The draft of Israeli military reservists, as well as the evacuation of Israeli citizens from areas near conflict zones have adversely affected our employees impacted by such actions. In addition, future government-imposed restrictions and precautions in response to such conflicts may negatively impact our employees, management and directors by interrupting their ability to effectively perform their roles and responsibilities. In addition, further hostilities involving Israel, possible damage to facilities and infrastructure, increased cyber attacks, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners, and/or the willingness to do business with companies with operations in Israel, as well as macroeconomic indications of deterioration of Israel s economic standing as reflected in the downgrading in Israel s credit rating by rating agencies that took place in parallel to these events, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. The intensity and duration of Israel s current war against Hamas, Hezbollah, and the other terror organizations is difficult to predict and we are continuing to monitor the situation and assessing its potential impact on our business. 
 We cannot attribute the impact of the current trends in advertising demand to any particular factor, including the conditions in Israel, and cannot predict the impact if the war continues or escalates further. See Item 1A Risk Factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information regarding certain risks associated with the conditions in Israel.

Macroeconomic Environment 
 General worldwide economic conditions have recently experienced significant instability, as well as volatility and disruption in the financial markets, resulting from factors including the effects of the wars between Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas and the expansion of such conflict, bank closures, the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and general economic uncertainty. The current macroeconomic environment, with variables such as inflation, increased interest rates, bank disruptions, recessionary concerns, bankruptcies, currency exchange rate fluctuations, global supply chain disruptions, and labor market volatility, has negatively impacted our advertisers. Accordingly, these conditions have adversely impacted our business and could, if they continue or worsen, adversely impact us in the future, including if our advertisers were to reduce or further reduce their advertising spending as a result of any of these factors. We continue to monitor our operations, and the operations of those in our ecosystem (including media partners, advertisers, and agencies). These conditions make it difficult for us, our media partners, advertisers, and agencies to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause a further reduction or delay in overall advertising demand and spending or impact our advertisers ability to pay, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Factors Affecting Our Business 
 Retention and Growth of Relationships with Media Partners 
 We rely on relationships with our media partners for a significant portion of our advertising inventory and our corresponding ability to drive advertising revenue. To further strengthen these relationships, we continuously invest in our technology and product functionality to drive user engagement and monetization by (i) improving our algorithms, referred to as our AI prediction engine; (ii) effectively managing supply and demand; (iii) expanding the adoption of our enhanced products by media partners; and (iv) expanding our demand capabilities to new formats and business lines such as Onyx, a branding platform designed to maximize consumer attention to deliver more effective branding and consideration campaigns. 
 Our relationships with media partners are typically long-term, exclusive, and strategic in nature. Our top 20 media partners, based on our 2023 revenue, have been using our platform for an average of seven years, despite their typical contract length being two to four years. Net revenue retention is an important indicator of media partner satisfaction, the value of our platform, as well as our ability to grow revenue from existing relationships. 
 We calculate media partner net revenue retention at the end of each quarter by starting with revenue generated on media partners properties during the same period in the prior year, Prior Period Retention Revenue. We then calculate the revenue generated on these same media partners properties in the current period, Current Period Retention Revenue. Current Period Retention Revenue reflects any expansions within the media partner relationships, such as any additional placements or properties on which we extend our recommendations, as well as contraction or attrition. Our media partner net revenue retention in a quarter equals the Current Period Retention Revenue divided by the Prior Period Retention Revenue. To calculate media partner net revenue retention for year-to-date and annual periods, we sum the quarterly Current Period Retention Revenue and divide it by the sum of the quarterly Prior Period Retention Revenue. These amounts exclude certain revenue adjustments and revenue recognized on a net basis. Our media partner net revenue retention was approximately 91 and 89 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our growth also depends on our ability to secure partnerships with new media partners. New media partners are defined as those relationships in which revenue was not generated in the prior period, except for limited instances where residual revenue was generated on a media partner s properties. In such instances, the residual revenue would be excluded from net revenue retention above. Revenue generated on new media partners properties contributed approximately 7 and 6 , respectively, to revenue growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our growth depends on media partners ability to drive traffic to their sites and generate page views. The proliferation of social media properties, streaming services and other platforms, as well as the adoption of AI have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our media partners growth. 
 User Engagement with Relevant Media and Advertising Content 
 Driving attention and engagement is the key pillar of our platform that drives value for consumers, media partners, and advertisers. Our AI prediction algorithm manages this dynamic, matching consumers with editorial and advertiser experiences that will deliver attention and engagement across the Open Internet. We believe that the user experience has a profound impact on long term user behavior patterns and thus compounds over time, improving our long-term monetization prospects. This principle guides our behavior, and as a result, we do not focus on the price of ads, nor on maximizing such prices, as key performance indicators for the business. We strive to compound consumer attention and engagement, continually enhancing value for both advertisers and media owners. 
 32 

Growth in attention and engagement is driven by several factors, including enhancements to our AI prediction technology, growth in the breadth and depth of our data assets, the size and quality of our content and advertising index, user engagement, new media partners, and expansion on existing media partners. As we grow attention and engagement, we are able to collect more data and continually improve our prediction engine which drives better results for our advertiser and media owner partners. This growth flywheel can be measured by growth of the consumer data points we drive, such as click-through-rate CTR ). CTR improvements increase the number of clicks on our platform. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to further grow consumer engagement, and thus our business, as today CTR for ads on our platform is less than 1 of ads served. With the launch of Onyx, we have expanded the measurable consumer data points that fuel our prediction engine, expanding our ability to drive concrete business outcomes at each step of the marketing funnel. Our Onyx platform optimizes towards an accountable outcome: attention. Onyx enables advertisers to deliver concrete ROAS with their branding campaigns, by providing high audience attention and corresponding incremental outcomes as a result, rather than ad views alone. 
 Advertiser Retention and Growth 
 Our engine serves the ad experiences that are predicted to deliver high attention or engagement, rather than on price of the ads. We believe this approach leads to better ROAS for advertisers, whether they are focused on driving a performance outcome, or a branding outcome. Our growth is partially driven by retaining and expanding the amount of spend by advertisers on our platform, as well as by acquiring new advertisers. Our launch of Onyx by Outbrain expanded Outbrain s total addressable market to now include top of the funnel marketing dollars while also attracting more diverse, premium demand. 
 We continually invest in enhancements to our platform that allow advertisers to drive concrete business outcomes and ROAS. In particular, we are expanding our usage of AI to automate manual tasks in campaign set up and optimization, and to enhance advertiser creative and landing page performance. 
 Prices paid by advertisers on our platform fluctuate period to period for a variety of reasons, including supply and demand balance, macroeconomic conditions, and seasonality. In order to grow our revenue and Ex-TAC Gross Profit and maximize value for our advertisers and media partners, our focus as a business is on driving business outcomes and ROAS for advertisers, not on optimizing for price. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023, tens of thousands of unique advertisers were active on our owned and operated platform, in addition to the thousands of advertisers who access Outbrain and Onyx environments through our programmatic partnerships. 
 Expansion Into New Environments, New Experiences and New Ad Formats 
 The accelerating pace of technological innovation has rapidly changed consumer habits. The available mediums and formats for consumers to engage with media has greatly expanded over the last several years. As this evolution in media consumption and consumer behavior continues, we are focused on utilizing our AI prediction technology to bring curated, relevant consumer experiences to these new devices, experiences and formats. 
 Fundamentally, we plan to continue to make our platform available for media partners on all types of devices and platforms and evolve our business to apply our technology to the most popular methods of media consumption, which now include unique video, high-impact display, and other new media experiences. 
 Examples of new environments in which content consumption is expected to grow include pre-installed applications on Smartphones, Smartphone content feeds, gaming applications, push notifications and connected TV. Additionally, we believe there is a strong opportunity to develop better personalization solutions for the visual and video consumption of news media across the Open Internet. 
 Through our acquisition of video intelligence AG vi ), a Swiss-based contextual video technology company for digital media owners in the first quarter of 2022, we expanded our video product offerings to new formats and environments, including pre-roll video formats. With the introduction of Onyx by Outbrain , we have expanded our investment in applying our AI prediction to these new video and high-impact formats, delivering a curated consumer experience that drives attention for enterprise brands. We plan to continue to evaluate strategic acquisition or investment opportunities as part of our growth strategy in the future. 
 The development and deployment of new ad formats allow us to better serve consumers, media partners and, ultimately, advertisers who seek to target and engage consumers at scale; we believe this continues to open and grow new types of advertiser demand, while ensuring relevance as the environments in which we operate diversify.

Investment in Our Technology and Infrastructure 
 Innovation is a core tenet of our Company and our industry. We plan to continue our investments in our people and our technology in order to retain and enhance our competitive position. For example, improvements to our AI prediction engine help us deliver more relevant ads, driving higher user engagement, thereby improving ROAS for advertisers and increasing monetization for our media partners. 
 We strongly believe in the transformative power of AI in shaping the future of sustainable media, and have been utilizing AI technology for years to empower both media owners and advertisers in their businesses. We leverage AI in a manner designed to enable media owners to increase their revenues and connect with audiences on their own platforms within the Open Internet. We use machine learning to predict consumer interest and propensity to convert ads to sales. We make around 1 billion such predictions every second. Our technology has developed into a robust AI machine learning system and is largely homegrown by our Research and Development team. One of the strongest long-term levers in our business is the continuous improvement of our algorithms and the data sets our algorithms learn from. Our direct integrations across our media partners properties provide us with a large volume of proprietary first-party data, including context, user interest and behavioral signals. The more data points we have, the better our CTR predictions and yield potential can be. 
 Our Smartlogic product dynamically adjusts both the arrangement and the formats of content delivered to a user, depending on the user s preferences and our media partner s key performance indicators KPIs ), designed to provide a tailored and engaging feed experience. We continue to invest in media partner and advertiser focused tools, technology, and products as well as privacy-centric solutions. For example, Keystone by Outbrain enables a more holistic management of overall revenue for media owners increasingly focused on revenue diversification. 
 We believe that our proprietary micro-services, API-based cloud infrastructure provides us with a strategic competitive advantage, as we are able to deploy code hundreds of times per day and grow in a scalable and highly cost-effective manner. As we develop and deploy solutions for enhanced integration of our technologies in new environments, with new content and ad formats, we anticipate activity through our platform to grow. We anticipate that the investment in our technology, infrastructure and solutions will contribute to our long-term growth. 
 Industry Dynamics 
 Our business depends on the overall demand for digital advertising, on the continuous success of our current and prospective media partners, and on general market conditions. Digital advertising is a rapidly growing industry, with growth that has outpaced the growth of the broader advertising industry. Content consumption continues to shift online, requiring media owners to adapt in order to successfully attract, engage and monetize their consumers. The soaring volume of online content, amplified by the latest generative AI innovations, has made content curation tools even more essential for consumers and media owners alike. 
 AI is revolutionizing content creation, distribution, and personalization; automating tasks like video editing, image recognition, and language translation. AI-powered systems are also improving content delivery, helping media platforms suggest relevant movies, shows, articles, and advertisements to consumers. This is especially important at a time when advertisers increasingly anticipate measurable results from their digital advertising investments. Our experience in this space enables us to more nimbly capitalize on the opportunities for media owners and advertisers to leverage AI and automation to engage consumers and optimize their business goals. 
 Regulators across most developed markets are increasingly focused on enacting and enforcing user privacy rules as well as exerting tighter oversight on the major walled garden platforms. Industry participants have recently been, and likely will continue to be, impacted by changes implemented by platform leaders, such as Apple s change to its Identifier for Advertisers policy and Google s evolving roadmap pertaining to the use of third-party cookies within its Chrome web browser. See Item 1A, Risk Factors'' in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding changing industry dynamics with respect to industry participants and the regulatory environment. Given our focu s on context and engagement, the depth and length of our media partner relationships, and our scale, we believe that we are well positioned in the long-term to address and potentially benefit from many of these industry dynamics. Additionally, we are confident that our strength in delivering engagement and clear outcomes for advertisers, built on our proprietary AI prediction engine, aligns well with the ongoing market shift towards increased accountability and expectations of ROAS from digital advertising spend. 
 34 

Seasonality 
 The global advertising industry experiences seasonal trends that affect most participants in the digital advertising ecosystem. Our revenue generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including seasonality, as many advertisers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday purchasing, as well as the timing of advertising budget cycles. Historically, the fourth quarter of the year has reflected the highest levels of advertiser spending, and the first quarter generally has reflected the lowest level of advertiser spending. 
 In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical and discretionary in nature, reflecting changes in brand advertising strategy, budgeting constraints, and buying patterns, and a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our control. The quarterly rate of increase in our traffic acquisition costs is generally commensurate with the quarterly rate of increase in our revenue. However, traffic acquisition costs have, at times, grown at a faster or slower rate than revenue, primarily due to the mix of the revenue generated or contracted terms with media partners. We generally expect these seasonal trends to continue, though historical seasonality may not be predictive of future results given the potential for changes in advertising buying patterns and macroeconomic conditions. These trends will affect our operating results and we expect our revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole. 
 Definitions of Financial and Performance Measures 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue from advertisers through ads that we deliver across a variety of media partner properties. We charge advertisers for clicks on and, to a lesser extent, impressions of their ads, depending on how they choose to contract with us. We recognize revenue in the period in which the click or impression occurs. 
 The amount of revenue that we generate depends on the level of demand from advertisers on our media partners properties. We generate higher revenue at times of high demand, which is also impacted by seasonal factors. For any given marketing campaign, the advertiser has the ability to adjust its price in real time and set a maximum spend. This allows advertisers to adjust the estimated ad spend attributable to the particular campaign. Due to the measurable performance that our advertisers achieve with us, a portion of our advertisers increase their level of spend with us over time as long as their ROAS objectives are met. 
 Our agreements with advertisers provide them with considerable flexibility to modify their overall budget, price (cost-per-click or cost-per-impression), and the ads they wish to deliver on our platform. 
 Traffic Acquisition Costs 
 We define traffic acquisition costs TAC as amounts owed to media partners for their share of the revenue we generated on their properties. We incur traffic acquisition costs in the period in which the revenue is recognized. Traffic acquisition costs are based on the media partners revenue share or, in some circumstances, based on a guaranteed minimum rate of payment from us in exchange for guaranteed placement of our ads on specified portions of the media partner s digital properties. These guaranteed rates are typically provided per thousand qualified page views, whereas our minimum monthly payment to the media partner may fluctuate based on how many qualified page views the media partner generates, generally subject to a maximum guarantee. As such, traffic acquisition costs may not correlate with fluctuations in revenue, and our rates may remain fixed even with a decrease in revenue. Traffic acquisition costs also include amounts payable to programmatic supply partners. 
 Other Cost of Revenue 
 Other cost of revenue consists of costs related to the management of our data centers, hosting fees, data connectivity costs and depreciation and amortization. Other cost of revenue also includes the amortization of capitalized software that is developed or obtained for internal use associated with our revenue-generating technologies. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. 
 35 

Research and Development. Research and development expenses are related to the development and enhancement of our platform and consist primarily of personnel and the related overhead costs, amortization of capitalized software for non-revenue generating infrastructure and facilities costs. 
 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and the related overhead costs for personnel engaged in marketing, advertising, client services, and promotional activities. These expenses also include advertising and promotional spend on media, conferences, and other events to market our services, and facilities costs. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and the related overhead costs, professional fees, facilities costs, insurance, and certain taxes other than income taxes. General and administrative personnel costs include, among others, our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal functions. Our professional service fees consist primarily of accounting, audit, tax, legal, information technology and other consulting costs, including our compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net is comprised of gain on convertible debt, interest expense, and interest income and other income, net. 
 Gain on Convertible Debt. In April 2023, we repurchased 118.0 million of our Convertible Notes at a discount of approximately 19 of the principal amount and recorded a pre-tax gain of 22.6 million. In September 2024, we repurchased the remaining 118.0 million of our Convertible Notes at a discount of approximately 7.5 of the principal amount and recorded a pre-tax gain of 8.8 million. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense consists of interest expense on the Convertible Notes, our revolving credit facility and our prior finance leases. Interest expense may increase if we incur any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or if we enter into new debt facilities or finance lease arrangements. 
 Interest Income and Other Income, net. Interest income and other income, net primarily consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities, discount amortization on our investments in marketable securities, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, relate to transactions and monetary asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies, including mark-to-market adjustments on undesignated foreign exchange forward contracts. Foreign currency gains and losses may continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 
 Provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign juris dictions, as well as deferred incom e taxes and changes in valuation allowance, reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. 
 Realization of our deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income. In considering the need for a valuation allowance, we consider our historical and future projected taxable income, as well as other objectively verifiable evidence, including our realization of tax attributes, assessment of tax credits and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue decreased 5.8 million, or 2.5 , to 224.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 230.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included net favorable foreign currency effects of approximately 1.3 million, and decreased 7.1 million, or 3.1 , on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year period. Our reported revenue decline was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately 21 million due to net revenue retention of approximately 91 on existing media partners, as we have experienced lower ad impressions from certain supply partners. This decrease was partially offset by growth of approximately 6.6 , or 15 million, from new media partners. 
 37 

See Non-GAAP Reconciliations for information regarding the constant currency measures provided in this discussion and below to supplement our reported results. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
 Traffic acquisition costs decreased 8.7 million, or 5.0 , to 164.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 173.2 million in the prior year period. Traffic acquisition costs included net unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 1.2 million, and decreased 9.9 million, or 5.7 , on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year period. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs was primarily related to the decrease in our revenue, a net favorable change in our revenue mix, and improved performance from certain deals. As a percentage of revenue, traffic acquisition costs decreased 190 basis points to 73.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 75.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other cost of revenue increased 0.4 million, or 4.1 , to 10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.4 million in the prior year period, primarily due to increased hosting costs. As a percentage of revenue, other cost of revenue increased to 4.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross profit increased 2.5 million, or 5.3 , to 48.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 46.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was largely attributable to lower traffic acquisition costs, partially offset by lower revenue, as previously described. 
 Ex-TAC Gross Profit 
 Our Ex-TAC Gross Profit increased 2.9 million, or 5.1 , to 59.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 56.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as the impact of lower revenue was more than offset by the net favorable change in our revenue mix and improved performance from certain deals. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations for the related definition and reconciliations to our gross profit. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses increased 8.0 million, or 18.4 , to 51.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 43.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to acquisition-related costs of 5.6 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased personnel-related costs of 3.0 million, offset in part by a 0.7 million reduction in our provision for credit losses. 
 The components of operating expenses are discussed below: 
 Research and development expenses increased 0.4 million, primarily due to higher personnel-related costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period. 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased 1.7 million, primarily due to a 1.0 million increase in personnel-related costs, as well as higher marketing and advertising costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period. 
 General and administrative expenses increased 5.9 million, primarily due to acquisition-related costs of 5.6 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased personnel-related costs of 1.7 million, offset in part by a 0.7 million reduction in our provision for credit losses. 
 Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 410 basis points to 23.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased acquisition-related costs and lower revenue. 
 Total Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Total other income (expense), net, increased 12.0 million to 10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net expense of 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a pre-tax gain of approximately 8.8 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 in connection with our repurchase of the remaining Convertible Notes, a favorable change of 1.4 million in mark-to-market adjustments on undesignated foreign exchange forward contracts used to manage our foreign currency exchange risk on net cash flows from 
 38 

our non-U.S. dollar denominated operations, and an increase of 1.4 million resulting from the remeasurement of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies. 
 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes was 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate decreased to 15.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the favorable impact relating to our uncertain tax positions (including resolution of a tax audit), a change to our foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and the change in our valuation allowance, partially offset by the favorable return to provision adjustments, and certain non-deductible stock-based compensation and transaction costs. 
 A provision enacted as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts Jobs Act requires companies to capitalize certain research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. As a result, excluding the impacts relating to the Convertible Debt repurchase and the Teads Transaction, we expect to pay higher cash taxes and expect our effective tax rate to be more favorably impacted by a deduction related to foreign-derived intangible income in 2024. 
 Our future effective tax rate may be affected by the geographic mix of earnings in countries with different statutory rates. Additionally, our future effective tax rate may be affected by our ongoing assessment of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, tax planning initiatives, as well as certain discrete items. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net income of 6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net income of 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.2 million to 11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to higher Ex-TAC Gross Profit, offset in part by higher operating expenses, as previously described. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations for the related definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations to our net income (loss). 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue decreased 32.3 million, or 4.7 , to 655.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 687.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our reported revenue decreased approximately 72 million due to net revenue retention of approximately 89 on existing media partners, as we have experienced lower ad impressions from certain supply partners. This decrease was partially offset by growth of approximately 5.7 , or 39 million, from new media partners. 
 See "Non-GAAP Reconciliations" for information regarding the constant currency measures provided in this discussion and below to supplement our reported results. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
 Traffic acquisition costs decreased 36.5 million, or 7.0 , to 487.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 524.0 million in the prior year period. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs was primarily related to the decrease in our revenue, a net favorable change in our revenue mix and improved performance from certain deals. As a percentage of revenue, traffic acquisition costs decreased 180 basis points to 74.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 76.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other cost of revenue decreased 0.2 million, or 0.7 , to 31.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 32.0 million in the prior year period, primarily due to lower server depreciation expense and network costs, partially offset by higher hosting costs. As a percentage of revenue, other cost of revenue increased to 4.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 39 

Gross profit increased 4.4 million, or 3.4 , to 136.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 131.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was largely attributable to lower traffic acquisition costs, partially offset by lower revenue, as previously described. 
 Ex-TAC Gross Profit 
 Our Ex-TAC Gross Profit increased 4.2 million, or 2.6 , to 167.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 163.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as the impact of lower revenue was more than offset by the net favorable change in our revenue mix and improved performance from certain deals. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations for the related definition and reconciliations to our gross profit. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses increased 5.3 million, or 3.6 , to 151.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 145.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The reported increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher professional fees of 7.8 million (including acquisition-related costs of 8.8 million recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset in part by the absence of the prior period regulatory matter costs of 0.7 million). The increase in operating expenses was also driven by a 3.0 million increase in personnel-related costs largely driven by higher incentive-based compensation. These increases were partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses of 3.1 million and a 2.4 million decrease in severance and related costs. 
 The components of operating expenses as compared to the prior year period are discussed below: 
 Research and development expenses decreased 0.4 million, primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related costs, largely due to lower severance costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased 1.3 million, primarily due to a 1.8 million decrease in personnel-related costs largely attributable to lower severance and related costs, partially offset by increased travel costs. 
 General and administrative expenses increased 7.0 million, primarily attributable to higher professional fees of 7.8 million (inclusive of acquisition-related costs of 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset in part by the absence of the prior period regulatory matter costs of 0.7 million), and higher personnel costs of 2.9 million largely driven by increased incentive-based compensation costs. These increases were partially offset by a 3.1 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, as well as lower insurance costs. 
 Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 190 basis points to 23.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 21.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to increased acquisition-related costs and lower revenue. 
 Total Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Total other income (expense), net decreased 10.4 million, to 13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 23.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a lower pre-tax gain of 13.8 million recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, in connection with the repurchases of our Convertible Notes. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of 1.7 million resulting from the remeasurement of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies, as well as reduced interest expense of 1.5 million due to the lower outstanding principal balance of Convertible Notes. 
 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 
 Benefit from income taxes was 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to provision for income taxes of 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to pre-tax loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to pre-tax income in the prior year period. Our effective tax rate increased to 67.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 35.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of uncertain tax positions (including resolution of a tax audit) and the change in valuation allowance, partially offset by certain non-deductible stock-based compensation and transaction costs and the tax impact related to the profitability of non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
 40 

A provision enacted as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts Jobs Act requires companies to capitalize certain research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. As a result, excluding the impacts relating to the Convertible Debt repurchase and the Teads Transaction, we expect to pay higher cash taxes and expect our effective tax rate to be more favorably impacted by a deduction related to foreign-derived intangible income in 2024. 
 Our future effective tax rate may be affected by the geographic mix of earnings in countries with different statutory rates. Additionally, our future effective tax rate may be affected by our ongoing assessment of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, tax planning initiatives, as well as certain discrete items. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 As a result of the foregoing, we recorded net loss of 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net income of 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA increased 5.8 million to 20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher Ex-TAC Gross Profit and lower recurring operating expenses, as previously described. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations for the related definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations to our net income (loss). 
 
 Non-GAAP Reconciliations 
 Because we are a global company, the comparability of our operating results is affected by foreign exchange fluctuations. We calculate certain constant currency measures and foreign currency impacts by translating the current year s reported amounts into comparable amounts using the prior year s exchange rates. All constant currency financial information being presented is non-GAAP and should be used as a supplement to our reported operating results. We believe that this information is helpful to our management and investors to assess our operating performance on a comparable basis. However, these measures are not intended to replace amounts presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from similar measures calculated by other companies. 
 We present Ex-TAC Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Ex-TAC Gross Profit, and Free Cash Flow because they are key profitability measures used by our management and the Board to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, develop short-term and long-term operational plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Accordingly, we believe that these measures provide information to investors and the market in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and the Board. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures below. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to significant limitations, including those identified below. In addition, other companies in our industry may define these measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures. As a result, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for revenue, gross profit, net loss or net cash provided by (used in) operating activities presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Ex-TAC Gross Profit 
 Ex-TAC Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. Gross profit is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. In calculating Ex-TAC Gross Profit, we add back other cost of revenue to gross profit. Ex-TAC Gross Profit may fluctuate in the future due to various factors, including, but not limited to, seasonality and changes in the number of media partners and advertisers, advertiser demand or user engagements. 
 There are limitations on the use of Ex-TAC Gross Profit in that traffic acquisition cost is a significant component of our total cost of revenue but not the only component and, by definition, Ex-TAC Gross Profit presented for any period will be higher than gross profit for that period. A potential limitation of this non-GAAP financial measure is that other companies, including companies in our industry which have a similar business, may define Ex-TAC Gross Profit differently, which may make comparisons difficult. As a result, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for revenue or gross profit presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 41 

The following table presents the reconciliation of Ex-TAC Gross Profit to gross profit, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In thousands) Revenue 224,177 230,015 655,289 687,589 Traffic acquisition costs (164,483) (173,224) (487,484) (524,024) Other cost of revenue (10,825) (10,401) (31,765) (31,999) Gross profit 48,869 46,390 136,040 131,566 Other cost of revenue 10,825 10,401 31,765 31,999 Ex-TAC Gross Profit 59,694 56,791 167,805 163,565 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense; interest income and other income, net; provision (benefit) for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation, and other income or expenses that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance, including, but not limited to regulatory matter costs, and severance costs related to our cost saving initiatives. We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period. 
 We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and the Board. However, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP information of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as a supplemental measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measures of our financial performance that are calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 The following table presents the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net income (loss) 6,696 508 (544) 6,185 Gain on convertible debt (8,782) (8,782) (22,594) Interest expense 1,444 1,456 2,950 4,428 Interest income and other income, net (3,536) (358) (7,687) (5,733) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 1,229 1,014 (1,110) 3,365 Depreciation and amortization 4,843 4,941 14,494 15,757 Stock-based compensation 4,052 3,046 11,487 9,153 Regulatory matter costs

 42 

Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow is defined as cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities, less capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Free cash flow is a supplementary measure used by our management and the Board to evaluate our ability to generate cash and we believe it allows for a more complete analysis of our available cash flows. Free cash flow should be considered as a supplemental measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measures of our financial performance that are calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 The following table presents the reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 25,898 (11,731) Purchases of property and equipment 
 (4,668) (7,870) Capitalized software development costs 
 (7,592) (7,864) Free cash flow 13,638 (27,465) 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We regularly evaluate the cash requirements for our operations, commitments, acquisitions, development activities and capital expenditures and manage our liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate priorities. Our current investment program is focused on achieving maximum returns within our investment policy parameters, while preserving capital and maintaining sufficient liquidity. 
 We believe that our operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. However, there are multiple factors that could impact our future liquidity, including our business performance, our ability to collect payments from our advertisers, having to pay our media partners even if our advertisers default on their payments, or other factors described under Item 1A Risk Factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. 
 In connection with entering into the definitive share purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding share capital of Teads, as discussed in more detail under Recent Developments - Share Purchase Agreement and Notes 3 and 10 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, we entered into a debt commitment letter, dated August 1, 2024 (the Commitment Letter ), with Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Jefferies Finance LLC and Mizuho Bank, LTD (collectively, the Commitment Parties ), pursuant to which the Commitment Parties have committed to provide (i) a 100 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the New Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) a senior secured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 750 million (the Bridge Facility ). The Bridge Facility will be used to fund the cash consideration for the Transaction to pay fees and expenses related thereto. Additionally, a portion of the Revolving Credit Facility may be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Transaction and to pay fees and expenses related thereto, and will otherwise be available, for working capital and general corporate purposes. The obligation of the Commitment Parties to provide the contemplated financings is subject to a number of customary conditions contained in the Commitment Letter, including the execution of definitive debt financing documentation contemplated by the Commitment Letter and the Transaction being consummated substantially contemporaneously with the initial funding of the Bridge Facility. We expect to replace the Bridge Facility with permanent financing, which we currently expect to include the issuance of debt securities or term loans. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash receipts from our advertisers, our cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, and the available capacity under our revolving credit facility discussed below. 
 While our collections in the prior year were negatively impacted by the closure of Silicon Valley Bank SVB ), we have historically experienced higher cash collections during our first quarter due to seasonally strong fourth quarter sales, and, as a result, our working capital needs typically decrease during the first quarter. We generally expect these trends to continue in future periods. 
 43 

As of September 30, 2024, our available liquidity was follows: 
 September 30, 2024 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents (1) 
 57,061 Short-term investments 73,467 Revolving Credit Facility (2) 
 73,935 Total 204,463 
 _____________________________________________ 
 (1) As of September 30, 2024, approximately 27.2 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the United States by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We currently do not have any plans to repatriate our earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. We intend to continue to reinvest our earnings from foreign operations for the foreseeable future, and do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. 
 (2) Our Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment thereto, with Silicon Valley Bank, a division of First Citizens Bank Trust Company, provides, subject to borrowing availability and certain other conditions, for revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to 75.0 million (the Facility ), with a 15.0 million sub-facility for letters of credit. Our borrowing availability under the Facility is calculated by reference to a borrowing base which is determined by specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable, based on the defined borrowing formula. The Facility will terminate on November 2, 2026. 
 The Facility contains representations and warranties, including, without limitation, with respect to collateral; accounts receivable; financials; litigation, indictment and compliance with laws; disclosure and no material adverse effect, each of which is a condition to funding. Additionally, the Facility includes events of default and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries, including, without limitation, restrictions on liens, indebtedness, investments, fundamental changes, dispositions, restricted payments, and prepayment of the Convertible Notes and of junior indebtedness. The Facility contains a financial covenant that requires, in the event that credit extensions under the Facility equal or exceed 85 of the lesser of the available commitments under the Facility or upon the occurrence of an event of default, our Company to maintain a minimum consolidated monthly fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00. We were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See Note 10 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to the Facility. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 As a general matter, our primary uses of liquidity are payments to our media partners, our operating expenses, capital expenditures, our long-term debt and the related interest payments, and repurchases under our 30 million share repurchase program. W e may also use our available cash to make acquisition s, such as our pending acquisition of Teads, or investment s in complementary companies or technologie s. We primarily use our operating cash for payments due to media partners and vendors, as well as for personnel costs, and other employee-related expenditures. Our contracts with media partners are generally variable based on volume or guarantee a minimum rate of payment if the media partner reaches certain performance targets. See Definitions of Financial and Performance Measures Traffic Acquisition Costs. 
 See above under Recent Developments - Share Purchase Agreement and below under Item 1A Risk Factors for information regarding cash requirements in connection with the pending Transaction with Teads. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 At December 31, 2023, we had 118.0 million principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding, with a maturity on July 27, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. As discussed above in Recent Developments, on September 19, 2024, we repurchased 118.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes out of the initially issued principal balance of 236.0 million, for approximately 109.7 million in cash, including accrued interest, representing a discount of approximately 7.5 to the principal amount of the repurchased notes. Following the closing of the repurchase, the repurchased notes were cancelled by the Trustee, and there were no Convertible Notes outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 See Note 10 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our Convertible Notes. 
 44 

Other Contractual Cash Obligations 
 As a result of our repurchase of the remaining Convertible Notes in September 2024, our remaining 118 million commitment relating to long-term debt has been extinguished. Accordingly, our interest obligations related to Convertible Notes of approximately 3.5 million per year through 2026 were eliminated. 
 On August 1, 2024, we entered into the Agreement with Altice to acquire all of the issued and outstanding share capital of Teads. The Company intends to fund the cash consideration for the Transaction, and pay related fees and expenses, with the net proceeds from permanent financing and cash on hand. See Notes 3 and 10 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information. 
 See Contractual Cash Obligations disclosure within Liquidity and Capital Resources section of our 2023 Form 10-K for detailed disclosures of our other material cash obligations as of December 31, 2023. 
 Share Repurchases 
 On December 14, 2022, our Board approved a new stock repurchase program, authorizing us to repurchase up to 30 million of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share, with no requirement to purchase any minimum number of shares. The manner, timing, and actual number of shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities. Shares may be repurchased through privately negotiated transactions or open market purchases, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The repurchase program may be commenced, suspended, or terminated at any time at our discretion without prior notice. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we repurchased 1,410,001 shares and 2,544,173 shares, respectively, with a fair value of 5.8 million and 12.7 million, respectively, under our share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining availability under our 30 million share repurchase program was 6.6 million . 
 In addition, we periodically withhold shares to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units and exercise of options and warrants in accordance with the terms of our equity incentive plans and the underlying award agreements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we withheld 123,903 shares and 128,043 shares, respectively, with a fair value of 0.5 million and 0.6 million , respectively, to satisfy the minimum employee tax withholding obligations. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our cash flow from investing activities primarily consists of capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. We spent 4.7 million in capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We currently anticipate that our capital expenditures will be between 7 million and 9 million in 2024, primarily relating to expenditures for servers and related equipment and other equipment. However, actual amounts may vary from these estimates. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes the major components of our net cash flows for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 25,898 (11,731) Net cash provided by investing activities 75,569 83,710 Net cash used in financing activities (116,894) (111,445) Effect of exchange rate changes 2,034 (1,568) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 (13,393) (41,034) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash from operating activities increased 37.6 million, to net cash provided by operating activities of 25.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of 11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a 33.2 million favorable change in our working capital, largely attributable to lower accounts receivable and prepaid expenses due to faster cash collections and timing of payments. In addition, net income after non-cash adjustments increased 4.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior year period. 
 45 

Our free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.6 million, as compared to use of cash of 27.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher operating cash flow, as discussed above, as well as lower capital expenditures. Free cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. See Non-GAAP Reconciliations for the related definition and a reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities decreased 8.1 million to 75.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 83.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net proceeds of 11.7 million from sales and maturities of marketable securities under our investment program (net of purchases), reflecting lower early redemptions of available-for-sale securities in connection with the repurchase of our Convertible Notes in September 2024, than in the prior year period. This decrease was partially offset by lower capital expenditures of 3.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased 5.5 million to 116.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 111.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This unfavorable change was primarily attributable to the 13.6 million increase in the repurchase price for the Convertible Notes repurchased in September 2024 than those repurchased in April 2023, partially offset by lower treasury share repurchases of 6.9 million and lower principal payments of 1.2 million due to finance lease expirations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 1 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for recently issued accounting standards, which may have an impact on our financial statements upon adoption. 
 JOBS Act Transition Period 
 We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, delaying the adoption of some accounting standards until they would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act for the adoption of certain accounting standards until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that have adopted new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not currently engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities, which includes special purpose entities and other structured finance entities. 
 
 46 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We have operations both in the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks include foreign exchange, interest rate, inflation and credit risks. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange ra tes. The majority of our revenue and cost of revenue are denominated in U.S. Dollars, with the remainder in other currencies. Our operating expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located. A majority of our operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars, with the remainder denominated primarily in New Israeli Shekels and to a lesser extent British pound sterling and Euros. We evaluate periodically the various currencies to which we are exposed and, from time to time, may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our foreign currency risk and reduce the potential adverse impact from the appreciation or the depreciation of our non-U.S. dollar-denominated operations, as appropriate. 
 Changes in U.S. Dollar against the currencies of the countries in which we operate impact our operating results, as further described in Item 2, Results of Operations. The effect of a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in our weighted-average exchange rates on our revenue, cost of revenue and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies would result in a 3.4 million unfavorable or favorable change to our operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a 8.2 million unfavorable or favorable change to our operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the United States. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents, investments and any future borrowings under the Facility. There have been no amounts outstanding under the Facility since we amended and restated our loan agreement in November 2021. Long-term debt recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was 118.0 million and bore a fixed rate of interest. There was no long-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents of 57.1 million and our investments in marketable securities of 73.5 million under our investment program, which consist of U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government bonds, commercial paper, U.S. corporate bonds and municipal bonds, all maturing within one year. The primary objectives of our investment program are focused on achieving maximum returns within our investment policy parameters, while preserving capital and maintaining sufficient liquidity. We plan to actively monitor our exposure to the fair value of our investment portfolio in accordance with our policies and procedures, which include monitoring market conditions, to minimize investment risk. 
 A 100-basis point change in interest rates as of September 30, 2024 would change the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately 0.3 million. Since our debt investments are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains and losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Our business is subject to risk associated with inflation. We continue to monitor the impact of inflation to minimize its effects. If our costs, including wages, were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Inflation throughout the broader economy has and could lead to reduced ad spend and indirectly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Credit Risk 
 Financial instruments that subject us to concentration of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents, investments and receivables. As part of our ongoing procedures, we monitor the credit levels and the financial condition of our customers in order to minimize our credit risk and require certain customers with higher potential credit risk to prepay for their campaigns. See Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K u nder We are subject to payment-related risks that may adversely affect our business, working capital, financial condition and results of operations. We do not factor our accounts receivables, nor do we maintain credit insurance to manage the risk of credit loss. We are also exposed to a risk that the counterparty to our foreign 
 47 

currency forward exchange contracts will fail to meet its contractual obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, we perform an evaluation of our counterparty credit risk and our forward contracts have a term of no more than 18 months. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues within a company are detected.
