Trust services are offered to Edward Jones U.S. clients through Edward Jones Trust Company Trust Co. ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership. Olive Street Investment Advisers, LLC ("Olive Street"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, provides investment advisory services to the Edward Jones Money Market Fund (the "Money Market Fund") and the twelve sub-advised mutual funds comprising the Bridge Builder Trust. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the use of certain estimates by management in determining the Partnership s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior period balances have been adjusted to align to current year presentation. The Partnership evaluated subsequent events for recognition or disclosure through the date these Consolidated Financial Statements were issued and identified no matters requiring disclosure other than those disclosed in Note 7. The interim financial information included herein is unaudited. However, in the opinion of management, such information includes all adjustments, consisting primarily of normal recurring accruals, which are necessary for a fair statement of the results of interim operations. The Partnership evaluated subsequent events for recognition or disclosure through the date these Consolidated Financial Statements were issued and identified no matters requiring disclosure. The results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 27, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "Annual Report"). There have been no material changes to the Partnership s significant accounting policies or disclosures of recently issued accounting standards as described in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 of the Annual Report, other than the modification and addition disclosed below.

 and , respectively, and collateral held for securities purchased under agreements to resell was and , respectively. Given the nature of the agreements for receivables from clients and given the counterparties for resale agreements are financial institutions that the Partnership considers to be reputable and reliable , the Partnership does not expect the fair value of collateral to fall below the value of the agreements frequently or for an extended period of time. Therefore, the expected credit loss was for each period. Additionally, partnership loan values remained below the value of capital allocated to partners, resulting in an expected credit loss of as of September 27, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 27, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, , and , respectively, of the receivable from clients balance and , and , respectively, of the receivable from mutual funds, insurance companies and other balance related to revenue contracts with customers. The related fees are paid out of client accounts or third-party products consisting of cash and securities, the collateral value of those accounts continues to exceed the amortized cost basis of these receivables and the receivables have a short duration. As a result, the Partnership does not expect an event or change which would result in the receivables being undercollateralized or unpaid . The expected credit loss for receivables from contracts with customers was as of September 27, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

In early 2023, the Partnership issued of Interests under the 2021 Plan. The remaining of Interests may be issued at the discretion of the Managing Partner in the future. The Partnership also issued of Interests pursuant to a private placement offering in 2024 and may issue additional Interests from time to time in the future. Proceeds from these offerings are expected to be used to meet growth needs or for other purposes. 

 or of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions. The net capital rules also provide that Edward Jones partnership capital may not be withdrawn if resulting net capital would be less than minimum requirements. Additionally, certain withdrawals require the approval of the SEC and FINRA to the extent they exceed defined levels, even though such withdrawals would not cause net capital to be less than minimum requirements. EJ Canada is a registered broker-dealer regulated by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization ("CIRO"). Under the regulations prescribed by CIRO, EJ Canada is required to maintain minimum levels of risk-adjusted capital, which are dependent on the nature of EJ Canada's assets and results of operations.

In addition to these matters, the Partnership provides for potential losses that may arise related to other contingencies. The Partnership assesses its liabilities and contingencies utilizing available information. The Partnership accrues for potential losses for those matters where it is probable that the Partnership will incur a potential loss to the extent that the amount of such potential loss can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with FASB ASC No. 450, Contingencies. This liability represents the Partnership s estimate of the probable loss as of September 27, 2024, after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the Partnership's experience with other legal and regulatory matters and discussion with legal counsel, and is believed to be sufficient. The aggregate accrued liability is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and may be adjusted from time to time to reflect any relevant developments. For such matters where an accrued liability has not been established and the Partnership believes a loss is both reasonably possible and estimable, as well as for matters where an accrued liability has been recorded but for which an exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued is both reasonably possible and estimable, the current estimated aggregated range of additional possible loss is up to as of September 27, 2024. This range of reasonably possible loss does not necessarily represent the Partnership's maximum loss exposure as the Partnership was not able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for all matters.

Management s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the Partnership s Annual Report. All amounts are presented in millions, except as otherwise noted. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The Partnership broadly categorizes its net revenues into four categories: fee revenue, trade revenue, net interest and dividends revenue (net of interest expense) and other revenue, net. In the Partnership s Consolidated Statements of Income, fee revenue is composed of asset-based fees and account and activity fees. Asset-based fees include program fees which are based on the average daily market value of client assets in the program, as well as contractual rates. These fees are impacted by changes in market values of the assets and by client dollars invested in and divested from the accounts. Account and activity fees are impacted by the number of client accounts and the variety of services provided to those accounts, among other factors. Trade revenue is composed of commissions and principal transactions revenue. Commissions are earned from the distribution of mutual fund shares and insurance products and the purchase or sale of securities. Principal transactions revenue primarily results from the Partnership's distribution of and participation in principal trading activities in municipal obligations, certificates of deposit and corporate obligations. Trade revenue is impacted by the trading volume (client dollars invested), mix of the products in which clients invest and the size of trades, all of which may be impacted by market volatility, and margins earned on the transactions. Net interest and dividends revenue is impacted by the amount of cash and investments, receivables from and payables to clients, the variability of interest rates earned and paid on such balances, the number of Interests outstanding and the balances of Partnership loans. Other revenue, net, primarily consists of unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in the fair market value of investment securities, resulting from changes in market levels and the interest rate environment.

 Third Quarter 2024 versus Third Quarter 2023 Overview 
 The Partnership ended the third quarter of 2024 with a 23 increase in client assets under care ("AUC") to 2.2 trillion and an 18 increase in average client AUC, reflecting increases in the market value of client assets as well as the cumulative impact of net new assets gathered. Advisory programs' average AUC increased 22 due to higher average market levels and the increased investment of client assets into advisory programs. Net new assets decreased 16 from higher asset outflows with ongoing macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and the higher costs of lending. 
 
 The Partnership ended the third quarter of 2024 with 19,885 financial advisors, representing a 5 increase compared to the end of the same period in 2023. Financial advisor attrition was 4.7 . The Partnership is continuing to invest in new tools and technology; an expanded set of products and solutions; and new practice models that give our financial advisors greater autonomy, flexibility and choice in how they serve clients. The Partnership remains focused on developing and rewarding branch teams and building new practice management capabilities to help them grow their practices. 
 
 Net revenue increased 18 to 4,123, primarily due to increases in fee revenue and trade revenue. The increase in fee revenue was primarily due to increases in advisory programs with higher average market levels and the increase in client dollars invested in advisory programs. Trade revenue increased primarily due to higher overall margins earned. 
 
 Operating expenses increased 15 to 3,564, primarily due to increases in financial advisor compensation and benefits expense and variable compensation. Financial advisor compensation and benefits increased primarily due to an increase in revenues on which commissions are earned. Variable compensation increased due to increased branch and overall Partnership profitability. 
 
 Overall, the increase in net revenue, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses, led to income before allocations to partners increasing 42 to 559. Income before allocations to partners margin increased to 13.3 , reflecting strong current financial results while continuing to invest in the future. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 27, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended September 29, 2023 Overview 
 Average client AUC increased 16 during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting increases in the market value of client assets as well as the cumulative impact of net new assets gathered. Advisory programs' average AUC increased 20 due to higher average market levels and the increased investment of client assets into advisory programs. Net new assets decreased 30 from higher asset outflows with ongoing macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and the higher costs of lending. 
 
 Net revenue increased 16 to 11,820, primarily due to increases in fee revenue and trade revenue. The increase in fee revenue was primarily due to increases in advisory programs with higher average market levels and the increase in client dollars invested in advisory programs. Trade revenue increased primarily due to higher overall margins earned. 
 
 Operating expenses increased 15 to 10,324, primarily due to increases in financial advisor compensation and benefits expense and variable compensation. Financial advisor compensation and benefits increased primarily due to an increase in revenues on which commissions are earned. Variable compensation increased due to increased branch and overall Partnership profitability. 
 
 Overall, the increase in net revenue, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses, led to income before allocations to partners increasing 24 to 1,496. Income before allocations to partners margin was 12.4 , reflecting a strategic balance between investing in the future and current financial results.

(1) Percentages represent client dollars invested in each product as a percent of total client dollars invested. 

Trade revenue increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 primarily due to an increase in commissions revenue and higher overall margin earned. Commissions revenue increased due to increases in insurance products and other, equities and mutual funds commissions revenue as a result of higher client dollars invested in each respective product. Overall margin increased with a larger portion of client dollars invested in equities, insurance products and mutual funds which earn higher margins than principal transaction products. 
 
 Net Interest and Dividends 
 
 Net interest and dividends revenue increased 2 to 229 and 11 to 705 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to a decrease in customer credit interest expense from lower client cash balances. The increase in the first nine months was primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on short-term investments, reflecting higher interest rates, as well as a decrease in customer credit interest expense from lower cash balances. The year-to-date increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income earned on client margin loans due to lower average loan balances.

(1) Prior period balances have been adjusted to align to current year presentation. 

(2) Counted on a full-time equivalent basis. 

The increases in operating expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 were primarily due to increases in financial advisor compensation and benefits expense and variable compensation, which are described below. 
 
 Financial advisor compensation and benefits expense increased 21 to 1,576 and 19 to 4,567 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. The increases in both periods were primarily due to increases in revenues on which commissions are earned and increased retirement transition plan ("RTP") costs from higher payouts and increased participation in the RTP program. 
 
 Home office and branch compensation and benefits expense increased 3 to 608 and 5 to 1,814 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. The increases in both periods were primarily due to increases in the number of client support team professionals and higher average wages. 
 
 25 

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued 

 Variable compensation expands and contracts in relation to the Partnership s profitability and margin earned. A significant portion of the Partnership s profits is allocated to variable compensation and paid to associates in the form of bonuses and profit sharing. The increases in variable compensation of 37 to 638 and 31 to 1,779 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, were due to increases in branch and overall Partnership profitability. 
 
 Segment Information 
 The Partnership has two operating and reportable segments based upon geographic location, the U.S. and Canada. Canada segment information, as reported in the following table, is based upon the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership s Canada operations. The U.S. segment information is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements less the Canada segment information as presented. Pre-variable income represents income before variable compensation expense and before allocations to partners. This is consistent with how management views the segments to assess performance. 
 
 The following table shows financial and other information for the Partnership s reportable segments.

 U.S. 
 Net revenue increased 18 to 4,014 and 17 to 11,495 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increases in fee revenue and trade revenue. The increase in fee revenue was primarily due to an increase in advisory programs fees revenue with higher average market levels and the increase in investment of client assets in advisory programs. Trade revenue increased primarily due to higher overall margins earned. 
 
 Operating expenses (excluding variable compensation) increased 11 to 2,841 and 13 to 8,291 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, primarily due to increases in financial advisor compensation and benefits expense. Financial advisor compensation and benefits increased primarily due to increases in revenues on which commissions are earned in both periods. 
 
 Income before allocations to partners increased 43 to 548 and 25 to 1,462 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. Income before allocations to partners margin was 13.4 and 12.5 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, reflecting a strategic balance in the U.S. between investing in the future and current financial results. 
 Canada 
 
 Net revenue increased 10 to 109 and 12 to 325 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increases in fee revenue and trade revenue. Fee revenue increased primarily due to an increase in advisory program fees with higher average market levels and the increase in investment of client assets in advisory programs in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Operating expenses (excluding variable compensation) increased 9 to 85 and 12 to 254 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, primarily due to increases in financial advisor compensation and benefits expense. Financial advisor compensation and benefits increased primarily due to increases in revenues on which commissions are earned in both periods. 
 
 Income before allocations to partners remained constant at 11 in the third quarter and increased 10 to 34 in the first nine months of 2024. Pre-variable income margin was 21.8 and 21.6 , respectively, reflecting a strategic balance in Canada between investing in the future and current financial results. 
 
 LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REFORM 
 As discussed more fully in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors Risk Related to the Partnership's Business Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives of the Partnership s Annual Report, the Partnership continues to monitor several proposed, potential and recently enacted federal and state legislation, rules and regulations. 
 
 MUTUAL FUNDS AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS 
 
 The Partnership estimates approximately 21 for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and 22 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2023 of its total revenue was derived from sales and services related to mutual fund and insurance products. 
 
 Significant reductions in these revenues due to changes in the mutual funds industry affecting fee structures that result in decreased margins earned, regulatory reform or other changes to the Partnership s relationship with mutual fund or insurance companies could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
 28 

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued 

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The Partnership requires liquidity to cover its operating expenses, net capital requirements, capital expenditures, distributions to partners and redemptions of Partnership interests, as well as to facilitate client transactions. The principal sources for meeting the Partnership s liquidity requirements include cash and cash equivalents, securities purchased under agreements to resell, government and agency investment securities, partnership capital and funds generated from operations, all discussed further below. The Partnership believes that the liquid nature of these sources provides flexibility for managing and financing the operating needs of the Partnership and will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months. Depending on conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Partnership will, from time to time, consider the issuance of additional Partnership capital and debt, the proceeds of which could be used to meet growth needs or for other purposes. 
 Partnership Capital 
 The Partnership s growth in capital has historically been the result of the sale of Interests to its associates and existing limited partners, the sale of subordinated limited partnership interests to its current or retiring general partners, and retention of a portion of general partner earnings. 
 
 The Partnership filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on December 8, 2021, to register 700 of Interests issuable pursuant to the Partnership's 2021 Employee Limited Partnership Interest Purchase Plan (the "2021 Plan"). In early 2023, the Partnership issued 568 of Interests under the 2021 Plan. The remaining 132 of Interests may be issued at the discretion of the Managing Partner in the future. The Partnership also issued 7 of Interests pursuant to a private placement offering in 2024 and may issue additional Interests from time to time in the future. Proceeds from these offerings are expected to be used to meet growth needs or for other purposes. 
 
 The Partnership s capital and profits interests subject to mandatory redemption as of September 27, 2024, net of reserve for anticipated withdrawals and Partnership loans, was 4,341, an increase of 292 from December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the additional capital contributions related to limited partner, subordinated limited partner and general partner interests 7, 65 and 271, respectively) and the retention of a portion of general partner earnings 147), partially offset by the net increase in Partnership loans outstanding 75) and the redemption of limited partner, subordinated limited partner and general partner interests 20, 13 and 90, respectively). During each of the three- and nine-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, the Partnership retained 13.8 of income allocated to general partners. 
 
 The Partnership makes loans available to those general partners and, in limited circumstances, subordinated limited partners (in each case, other than members of the Enterprise Leadership Team ("ELT"), as defined in the Partnership s Twenty-Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Registered Limited Liability Limited Partnership, dated August 15, 2023 (the "Partnership Agreement")), who require financing for some or all of their Partnership capital contributions. Partners borrowing from the Partnership will be required to repay such loans by applying the earnings received from the Partnership to such loans, net of amounts retained by the Partnership, amounts distributed for income taxes and a portion of earnings distributed to the partner. The Partnership has full recourse against any partner that defaults on loan obligations to the Partnership. The Partnership does not anticipate that partner loans will have an adverse impact on the Partnership s short-term liquidity or capital resources. 
 
 Any partner may also choose to have individual banking arrangements for their Partnership capital contributions. The Partnership does not guarantee these bank loans, nor can the partner pledge their partnership interest as collateral for the bank loan. The Partnership performs certain administrative functions in connection with its limited partners who have elected to finance a portion of their Partnership capital contributions through individual unsecured bank loan agreements. For all limited partner capital contributions financed through such bank loan agreements, each agreement instructs the Partnership to apply the proceeds from the redemption of that individual s capital account to the repayment of the limited partner's bank loan prior to any funds being released to the partner. In addition, the partner is required to apply Partnership earnings, net of any distributions to pay taxes, to service the interest and principal on the bank loan. Partners who finance all or a portion of their capital contributions with bank financing may be more likely to request the withdrawal of capital to meet bank financing requirements should the partners experience a period of reduced earnings. As a partnership, any withdrawals by general partners, subordinated limited partners or limited partners would reduce the Partnership s available liquidity and capital. 
 29 

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued 

 Many of the same banks that provide financing to limited partners also provide financing to the Partnership. To the extent these banks increase credit available to the partners, financing available to the Partnership may be reduced. 
 
 The following table represents amounts related to Partnership loans as well as bank loans (for which the Partnership facilitates certain administrative functions). Partners may have arranged their own bank loans to finance their Partnership capital for which the Partnership does not facilitate certain administrative functions and therefore any such loans are not included in the table.

In accordance with the terms of the Partnership's 500 committed revolving line of credit (the "2022 Credit Facility"), entered into in October 2022, the Partnership is required to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 35 and minimum Partnership capital, net of reserve for anticipated withdrawals and Partnership loans, of at least 2,809. In addition, Edward Jones is required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of at least 1,349 and minimum regulatory net capital of at least 6 of aggregate debit items as calculated under the alternative method. The Partnership has the ability to draw on various types of loans. The associated interest rate depends on the type of loan, duration of the loan and the Partnership's private credit rating. Contractual rates are based on an index rate plus the applicable spread. The 2022 Credit Facility is intended to provide short-term liquidity to the Partnership should the need arise. As of September 27, 2024, the Partnership was in compliance with all covenants related to the 2022 Credit Facility. 
 30 

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued 

 In addition, the Partnership has multiple uncommitted secured lines of credit totaling 390 that are subject to change at the discretion of the banks. The Partnership also has an additional uncommitted line of credit where the amount and the associated collateral requirements are at the bank's discretion in the event of a borrowing. Based on credit market conditions and the uncommitted nature of these credit facilities, it is possible that these lines of credit could decrease or not be available in the future. Actual borrowing capacity on secured lines is based on availability of client margin securities or firm-owned securities, which would serve as collateral on loans in the event the Partnership borrowed against these lines. 
 
 There were no amounts outstanding on the 2022 Credit Facility or the uncommitted lines of credit as of September 27, 2024 or December 31, 2023. In addition, the Partnership did not have any draws against these lines of credit during the nine-month period ended September 27, 2024, except for periodically testing draw procedures. 
 
 Cash Activity 
 As of September 27, 2024, the Partnership had 1,944 in cash and cash equivalents and 736 in securities purchased under agreements to resell, which generally have maturities of less than one week. This totaled 2,680 of Partnership liquidity as of September 27, 2024, a 4 decrease from 2,784 as of December 31, 2023. The Partnership also held 895 and 600 in government and agency obligations as of September 27, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, to help facilitate cash management and maintain firm liquidity. The Partnership had 13,246 and 15,565 in cash and investments segregated under federal regulations as of September 27, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which was not available for general use. The decrease in cash and investments segregated under federal regulations was primarily due to the changes in net cash owed to clients based on their account activity during the period. 
 Regulatory Requirements 
 As a result of its activities as a U.S. broker-dealer, Edward Jones is subject to the net capital provisions of Rule 15c3-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and capital compliance rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"). Under the alternative method permitted by the rules, Edward Jones must maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of 0.25 or 2 of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions. The net capital rules also provide that Edward Jones partnership capital may not be withdrawn if resulting net capital would be less than minimum requirements. Additionally, certain withdrawals require the approval of the SEC and FINRA to the extent they exceed defined levels, even though such withdrawals would not cause net capital to be less than minimum requirements. 
 
 EJ Canada is a registered broker-dealer regulated by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization ("CIRO"). Under the regulations prescribed by CIRO, EJ Canada is required to maintain minimum levels of risk-adjusted capital, which are dependent on the nature of EJ Canada's assets and results of operations.

 THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION 
 
 The Partnership s net assets are primarily monetary, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, cash and investments segregated under federal regulations, firm-owned securities, and receivables, less liabilities. Monetary net assets are primarily liquid in nature and would not be significantly affected by inflation. Inflation and future expectations of inflation influence securities prices, as well as activity levels in the securities markets. As a result, profitability and capital may be impacted by inflation and inflationary expectations. Additionally, inflation s impact on the Partnership s operating expenses may affect profitability to the extent that additional costs are not recovered through attracting new clients, gathering new assets or raising prices of services offered by the Partnership to increase revenue. 
 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in particular Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. securities laws. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, project, will, should, and other expressions which predict or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters. You should not rely on forward-looking statements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the control of the Partnership.

 Some of the factors that might cause differences between forward-looking statements and actual events include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) general economic conditions, including inflation, an economic downturn, a recession or volatility in the U.S. and/or global securities markets, actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and/or central banks outside of the United States and economic effects of international geopolitical conflicts, the U.S. federal debt ceiling, widespread health epidemics or pandemics or other major world events; (2) actions of competitors; (3) the Partnership's ability to attract and retain qualified financial advisors and other employees; (4) changes in interest rates; (5) regulatory actions; (6) changes in legislation or regulation; (7) litigation; (8) the ability of clients, other broker-dealers, banks, depositories and clearing organizations to fulfill contractual obligations; (9) changes in technology and other technology-related risks; (10) a fluctuation or decline in the fair value of securities; and (11) the risks discussed under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in the Partnership s Annual Report. These forward-looking statements were based on information, plans, and estimates at the date of this report, and the Partnership does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events or other changes, except as required by law. 
 32 

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

 ITEM 3. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market RISK 
 Various levels of management within the Partnership manage the Partnership s risk exposure. Position limits in inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit risk related to various financing activities is reduced by the industry practice of obtaining and maintaining collateral. The Partnership monitors its exposure to counterparty risk through the use of credit exposure information, the monitoring of collateral values and the establishment of credit limits. For further discussion of monitoring, see the Risk Management discussion in Part III, Item 10 Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of the Partnership s Annual Report. All amounts are presented in millions, except as otherwise noted. 
 The Partnership is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. Such changes in interest rates impact the income from interest-earning assets, primarily client margin loans and investments, which are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents, investments segregated under federal regulations, certain investment securities and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Client margin loans and investments averaged 3.1 billion and 17.3 billion, respectively, for the nine-month period ended September 27, 2024 and earned interest at an average annual rate of approximately 827 and 493 basis points (8.27 and 4.93 ), respectively, during the first nine months of 2024. Changes in interest rates also have an impact on the expense related to the liabilities that finance these assets, such as amounts payable to clients. 
 The Partnership performed an analysis of its financial instruments and assessed the related interest rate risk and materiality in accordance with the SEC rules. To estimate the impact of a 100-basis point (1.00 change on net interest income, the Partnership uses a forecasting model to assess the sensitivity of net interest income to the movements in interest rates. The model estimates the sensitivity by calculating interest income and interest expense in a balance sheet environment using current balances at the end of the reporting period. Assumptions used in the model include the interest rate movement, along with interest related risks such as pricing spreads and the Partnership's determined returns on client cash accounts. Under current and expected market conditions, and based on current levels of interest-earning assets and the liabilities that finance those assets, the Partnership estimates that a 100-basis point (1.00 increase in short-term interest rates could increase its annual net interest income by approximately 75. Conversely, the Partnership estimates that a 100-basis point (1.00 decrease in short-term interest rates could decrease the Partnership s annual net interest income by approximately 122. This estimate reflects minimum contractual rates on certain balances. This analysis excludes client assets that are held off-balance sheet in the Money Market Fund and at third-party banks participating in the Partnership's Insured Bank Deposit program. 
 ITEM 4. controls and procedures 
 The Partnership maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Partnership s certifying officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based upon an evaluation performed as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Partnership s certifying officers, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 27, 2024. 
 There have been no changes in the Partnership s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
