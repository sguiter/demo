NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

. Adial is presently engaged in
the development of medications for the treatment or prevention of addictions and related disorders. 

Adial s wholly owned
subsidiary, Purnovate, Inc. Purnovate ), was formed on January 26, 2021 to acquire Purnovate, LLC, an entity formed in December
of 2019. Purnovate was a drug development company with a platform focused on developing drug candidates for non-opioid pain reduction
and other diseases and disorders potentially targeted with adenosine analogs that are selective, potent, stable, and soluble. On January
27, 2023, the Company entered into an option agreement for the acquisition of Purnovate s assets and business with Adovate, LLC Adovate ), a Virginia limited liability company that was formed and majority owned by a then director of the Company and
then CEO of Purnovate and that was therefore a related party. On May 8, 2023, Adovate sent a letter to the Company exercising its option
effective May 16, 2023 for the purchase of the assets and business of the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Purnovate and made
payment of the in fees due on exercise. Effective June 30, 2023, Adovate issued to the Company the equity stake in Adovate due
on exercise of the option agreement. On August 17, 2023, a Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption Agreement Bill of Sale was executed between Purnovate and Adovate, transferring the Purnovate assets to Adovate, effective as of June 30, 2023. On August 17,
2023, Purnovate and Adovate also entered into a Letter Agreement which stated that Adovate acquired the assets of Purnovate effective
as of June 30, 2023, pursuant to the Bill of Sale. On September 18, 2023, the parties executed a final acquisition agreement which memorialized
the terms of the sale of the Purnovate assets to Adovate pursuant to the Option Agreement and Bill of Sale. See Note 4 for additional
information. 

In July of 2022, the Company
released data from its ONWARD Phase 3 pivotal trial of its compound AD04 AD04 for the treatment of Alcohol Use
Disorder. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA has indicated they will accept heavy-drinking-day based endpoints
as a basis for approval for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder rather than the previously required abstinence-based endpoints. Key
patents have been issued in the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions for which the Company has exclusive license
rights. The active ingredient in AD04 is ondansetron, a serotonin-3 antagonist. Due to its mechanism of action, AD04 has the potential
to be used for the treatment of other addictive disorders, such as Opioid Use Disorder, obesity, smoking, and other drug addictions. 

million from the exercise of warrants. During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company received an additional million in net proceeds from exercise of an at-the-market sales agreement. The Company
will nonetheless require additional capital to continue operating and development of AD04. There is no certainty that the Company will
be able to access additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all, to continue operations after whatever funds are received from the
buyer are expended. If unable to access sufficient capital, the Company would be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all
of its research and development programs or delay its approach to commercialization of AD04, which would likely have a material adverse
effect on the Company and its financial statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion and analysis is intended
as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. The discussion
should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes presented herein included in this Form
10-Q and the audited financial statements and the other information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023 that we filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). ln addition to historical information, the following
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those set forth below under Risk Factors and elsewhere herein, and
those identified under Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in
these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein and any other periodic reports filed and to be filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 

Overview 

We are a clinical-stage
biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapeutics for the treatment or prevention of addiction and related disorders.
Our investigational new drug candidate, AD04, is being developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of alcohol use disorder AUD ).
AD04 was recently investigated in a Phase 3 clinical trial, designated the ONWARD trial, for the potential treatment of AUD in subjects
with certain target genotypes, which were identified using our companion diagnostic genetic test. Based on our analysis of the subgroup
data from the ONWARD trial, we are now focused on completing the clinical development program for AD04 in the specified genetic subgroups
to meet regulatory requirements primarily in the US and secondarily in Europe/UK. 

In January 2021, we expanded our portfolio in
the field of addiction with the acquisition of Purnovate, LLC via a merger into our wholly owned subsidiary, Purnovate, Inc. Purnovate and in January 2023, we entered into an option agreement with Adovate LLC Adovate ), pursuant to which we granted to Adovate
an exclusive option for Adovate or its designated affiliate to acquire all of the assets of Purnovate and to assume related liabilities
and expenses. (Our then-CEO was a significant equity holder in Purnovate, LLC, so this was considered a related party transaction.) On
May 8, 2023, Adovate sent a letter exercising its option effective May 16, 2023 and made payment of the 450,000 in fees due on exercise.
Effective June 30, 2023, Adovate issued to us the equity stake in Adovate due on exercise of the option agreement. On August 17, 2023,
a Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption Agreement Bill of Sale was executed between Purnovate and Adovate, transferring
the Purnovate assets to Adovate, effective as of June 30, 2023. On August 17, 2023, Purnovate and Adovate also entered into a letter agreement
acknowledging that Adovate acquired the assets of Purnovate effective as of June 30, 2023, pursuant to the Bill of Sale. 

We have devoted the vast
majority of our resources to development efforts relating to AD04, including preparation for and conducting clinical trials, providing
general and administrative support for these operations and protecting our intellectual property. We expect these activities to continue
to demand most of our resources for the foreseeable future. 

We currently do not have any products approved for sale and we have
not generated any significant revenue since our inception. From our inception through the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
we have funded our operations primarily through the private and public placements of debt, equity securities, and an equity line. 

Our current cash and cash equivalents are not
expected to be sufficient to fund operations for the twelve months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, based on
our current commitments and development plans. 

We have incurred net losses in each year since
our inception, including net losses of approximately 11.1 million and 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year
ended December 31, 2023, respectively. We had accumulated deficits of approximately 79.9 million and 68.8 million as of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. All of our operating losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from costs
incurred in continuing operations, including costs in connection with our continuing research and development programs and from general
and administrative costs associated with our operations. Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes uncapitalized
financing costs, such as the cost of issuing new warrants to induce a holder to exercise existing warrants. 

We will not generate revenue from product sales
unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for AD04, which we expect will take a number of years
and is subject to significant uncertainty. We do not believe our current cash and equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations
for the next twelve months from the filing of these financial statements. 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial
revenue from product sales, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings,
government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic
alliances and licensing arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed
on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative
impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop AD04.

Recent Developments 

Financial Developments 

On March 1, 2024, we entered into a warrant inducement
agreement (the Inducement Agreement with a certain holder (the Holder of our warrants (the Existing
Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share (the common stock ), issued in a private
placement offering that closed on October 24, 2023. Pursuant to the Inducement Agreement, the Holder of the Existing Warrants agreed to
exercise for cash the Existing Warrants to purchase up to approximately 1,150,000 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of 2.82
per share. The transactions contemplated by the Inducement Agreement closed on March 6, 2024. We received aggregate gross proceeds of
approximately 3.5 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by us. Net proceeds of this transaction were
approximately 3.1 million. 

In consideration of the Holder s immediate
exercise of the Existing Warrants and the payment of 0.125 per New Warrant (as such term is defined below) in accordance with the Inducement
Agreement, we issued unregistered Series C Warrants (the New Warrants to purchase 2,300,000 shares of common stock (200 
of the number of shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants) (the New Warrant Shares to the Holder
of Existing Warrants. 

On March 1, 2024, warrants to purchase 268,440
warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 2.82 per share were exercised for gross proceeds of approximately
 757 thousand. 

On April 18, 2024, we entered into an At the Market Offering Agreement
(the ATM Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC (the Sales Agent or Wainwright providing
for sale of our shares of common stock, from time to time, through the Sales Agent, with certain limitations on the number of shares of
common stock that may be offered and sold by us as set forth in the ATM Agreement. The aggregate market value of the shares of Common
Stock eligible for sale under the ATM prospectus supplement filed in connection with the ATM Agreement was 4,283,650 which is based on
the limitations of such offerings under SEC regulations. The ATM Agreement provides that we will pay the Sales Agent commissions for its
services in acting as agent in the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement. The Sales Agent will be entitled to compensation
at a fixed commission rate of 3.0 of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement. The offering
of shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of all shares of common stock
subject to the ATM Agreement; or (ii) termination of the ATM Agreement by us as permitted therein. During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, we used this ATM Agreement to sell 2,348,520 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 4 million, after fees
and expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 2,109,700 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement
for net proceeds of approximately 3.8 million.

Research and development R D expenses 

Research and development expenses increased by approximately 825,000
(399 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The key drivers of the
increase were direct clinical trial expenses associated with the Phase 1b trial, which increased by approximately 771,000, the bulk of
trial activities taking place in the third quarter of 2024, and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) expenses which increased
by approximately 204,000, as stability testing took place to support the Phase 1b trial in 2024. These increases were partially offset
by modest decreases in license royalty expense of 60,000, and decreases of approximately 52,000 in the salaries of R D personnel
and of approximately 12,000 in equity-based compensation of R D personnel. 

General and administrative expenses G A expenses 

General and administrative expenses increased
by approximately 29,000 (3 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.
This modest increase was the sum of many small changes, the larger of which were increased direct patent expenses of approximately 45,000,
increased investor and public relations expenses of approximately 42,000. These increases were somewhat offset by decreased compensation
of G A directed employees of approximately 45,000, along with a number of smaller decreased expense categories. 

Losses from Equity Method Investment 

The expense recognized to the change in the value
of our equity method investment in Adovate, LLC increased by approximately 31,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is entirely due to the fact that this investment was only acquired on June
30 of 2023, with changes to the value of our Adovate equity recognized on a three month lag. 

Total Other income (expenses) 

Total other income, excluding losses from the
equity method investment, increased by approximately 41,000 (410 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was entirely due to the increase in interest income that came from a substantial higher
working cash balance held in the period. 

Gain from discontinued operations, net
of tax 

The loss from discontinued operations, net of
tax, decreased by approximately 37,000 (100 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023. This decrease is wholly due to the fact that the business of Purnovate, Inc., the activities of which are now classified as
discontinued, was sold in June of 2023 and all activity ceased, with the last, residual expenses associated with the business being recognized
in September of 2023.

Research and development R D expenses 

Research and development expenses increased by
approximately 1,495,000 (149 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The key drivers of this increase were direct clinical trial expenses associated with the Phase 1b trial initiated in 2024, which increased
by approximately 1,273,000, the conduct of was initiated and took place in 2024, and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) expenses
which increased by approximately 291,000, as stability testing took place to support the Phase 1b trial in 2024. These increases were
amplified by added use of regulatory and product development strategic consultants for increased expense of approximately 29,000 and
increases of approximately 24,000 in the salaries of R D personnel, partially offset by an approximately 137,000 reduction in equity-based
compensation of R D personnel, which in 2023 included both options expense and bonuses paid in the form of stock. 

General and administrative expenses G A expenses 

General and administrative expenses decreased
by approximately 256,000 (6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This
decrease was the result of lower corporate legal expense of approximately 100,000, lower insurance premiums of approximately 45,000,
and a decrease in compensation of G A directed employees of approximately 140000. These decreases were partially offset by an increase
in investor and public relations expenses of approximately 35,000. 

Losses from Equity Method Investment 

The expense recognized to the change in the value
of our equity method investment in Adovate, LLC increased by approximately 443,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is entirely due to the fact that this investment was only acquired on June
30 of 2023, with changes to the value of our Adovate equity recognized on a three month lag. 

Inducement Expense 

The inducement expense of approximately 4,464,000
which was a one time, noncash expense associated with the issuance of new warrants to induce the exercise of outstanding warrants which
occurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Total Other income (expenses) 

Total other income, excluding losses from the
equity method investment and inducement expense, increased by 117,000 (1671 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to two factors: the increase of approximately 66,000 in interest income
that resulted from a higher cash balance held in the period, and a one time expense in the prior year period of approximately 52,000
related to issuing commitment shares on establishment of our standby equity purchase agreement. 

Income from discontinued operations,
net of tax 

The gain from discontinued operations, net of
tax, decreased by approximately 1,894,000 (100 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. This decrease is wholly due to the fact that the business of Purnovate, Inc., the activities of which are now classified as
discontinued, was sold in June of 2023 and all activity ceased.

Liquidity and Capital Resources at September
30, 2024 

Our principal liquidity needs have historically been working capital,
R D costs including clinical trials, patent costs and personnel costs. We expect these needs to continue to increase in the near term
as we engage in clinical trials and develop and eventually commercialize our compound, if approved by regulatory authorities. Over the
next several years, we expect to increase our R D expenses as we undergo clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of
our lead product candidate. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with the proceeds from our initial and secondary public offerings,
sales pursuant to out ATM Agreement and, to a lesser extent, private placements and our equity line, as well as other equity financings,
warrant exercises, and the issuance of debt securities prior to that. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
our primary sources of funding was the exercise of previously issued warrants and the use of our ATM Agreement. 

On March 1, 2024, warrants to purchase 268,440
shares of common stock at an exercise price of 2.82 per share were exercised for gross proceeds of approximately 757 thousand. 

On March 1, 2024, we entered into the Inducement
Agreement pursuant to which the Holder of the Existing Warrants exercised for cash the Existing Warrants to purchase up to approximately
1,150,000 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of 2.82 per share. The transactions contemplated by the Inducement Agreement closed
on March 6, 2024 and we received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 3.5 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other
expenses payable by us. Net proceeds of this transaction were approximately 3.1 million. 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we
sold 2,348,520 shares of common stock through our ATM agreement, for net proceeds of approximately 4 million after placement fees and
expenses. 

We have been using and will continue to use the
additional 7.8 million in funding received from warrant exercises and sales of our common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement to accelerate
the development of AD04. 

We have initiated and nearly completed Phase 1
pharmacokinetic study of AD04 with an estimated total cost of approximately 1.4 million, of which approximately 1.2 million has been
paid, with the remaining 200 thousand expected to be paid by the end of 2024. In addition, we plan to begin a Phase III study of AD04
in the second half of 2025, to complete production of sufficient drug product to carry out the study, and to begin the process of revalidation
for our companion diagnostic to be included in our Phase III study. Were we to proceed with all these additional accelerated development
plans without raising any additional funds, we would potentially expend our cash on hand by during the second quarter of 2025. However,
management retains the ability to delay implementation of these plans and will not proceed without having first secured sufficient funding
either through a financing or a partnership agreement. If these additional accelerated development plans are not implemented, our cash
on hand would be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our existing commitments into the second half of 2025. 

If we are successful in raising sufficient additional
funds, under our accelerated development plans, we expect to use between approximately 13 million and 16 million in cash during the
twelve months ended September 30, 2025 for both AD04 development costs and general corporate expenses, of which between approximately
 9 million and 12.0 million are contingent on our implementation of our accelerated development plans. Since implementation of our accelerated
development plans would require the expenditure of our current cash on hand by in the second quarter of 2025, we will not be able to fully
implement our accelerated development plans without additional financing. We do not have any fixed commitments of financing and there
can be no assurance that we will be able secure financing on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, there is no assurance that funds
could be raised on acceptable terms to continue our operations and AD04 development projects before we have expended our current cash
on hand, even if we delay our accelerated development plans. 

We will require additional financing as we continue
to execute our overall business strategy, including two additional Phase 3 trials for AD04 that are currently expected to require an average
of 8-12 million each in direct expenses, and up to 5 million in additional other development expenses. These estimates may change based
on upcoming discussions with regulatory authorities and final trial designs. Our liquidity may be negatively impacted as a result of research
and development cost increases in addition to general economic and industry factors. Our continued operations will depend on our ability
to raise additional capital through various potential sources, such as equity and/or debt financings, grant funding, strategic relationships,
or out-licensing in order to complete its subsequent clinical trial requirements for AD04. Management is actively pursuing financing and
other strategic plans but can provide no assurances that such financing or other strategic plans will be available on acceptable terms,
or at all. Without additional funding, we will be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development
programs, which would likely have a material adverse effect on us and our financial statements. 

20 

If we raise additional funds by issuing equity
securities or convertible debt, our shareholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed
payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such
as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and
licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our products, future revenue streams or
product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be
available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to raise capital in the future could have a negative impact on our financial condition
and our ability to pursue our business strategies.

Net cash used in operating activities continuing operations 

Net cash used in operating activities increased
by approximately 870,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary
drivers of the increase were higher operating expenses of 1,240,000 and a decrease in equity compensation of 849,000, partially offset
by the favorable increase of 1,150,000 in the net change in operating assets and liabilities when comparing the same two periods. 

Net cash used in discontinued operations 

Net cash used in discontinued operations decreased
by approximately 986,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was entirely
due to the completion of the sale of the discontinued operations in June of 2023, after which these operations ceased requiring the use
of cash. 

Net cash provided by investing activities 

Net cash provided by investing activities decreased
by approximately 1,150,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
was driven by payments received in the prior year period related to the sale of Purnovate. 

Net cash provided by financing activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities increased by approximately
 7,846,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, we engaged in a single limited sale of common stock to a single individual investor, whereas in the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, we sold 2,348,520 shares of common stock through our ATM agreement for net proceeds of approximately 4,021,000 and
realized additional funds from the induced and uninduced exercise of additional warrants for net proceeds of approximately 3,824,000. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. We evaluate
these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results and experiences may differ
materially from these estimates. We did not identify any critical accounting estimates. Our significant accounting policies are more fully
described in Note 3 to our financial statements included with this report. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures . 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under
the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is
accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We have identified material weaknesses
in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified to date include (i) lack of formal risk assessment
under COSO framework: (ii) policies and procedures which are not adequately documented; (iii) lack of proper approval processes, review
processes and documentation for such reviews; (iv) insufficient GAAP experience regarding complex transactions and ineffective review
processes over period end financial disclosure and reporting; (v) deficiencies in the risk assessment, design and policies and procedures
over information technology general controls; and (vi) insufficient segregation of duties. 

Due to the material weaknesses in internal control
over financial reporting as described above, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that based on their
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective. 

Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described
above, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects our financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Remediation Plan for Existing Material Weakness 

Management continues to take steps to remediate
the weaknesses described above. Management has engaged consulting services to ameliorate those material weaknesses stemming from its small
number of personnel, in particular consultants with significant GAAP experience and IT security experts. Management is committed to additional
remediation steps, including formal risk assessment, improved documentation of the Company s controls, and redesign of inadequate
approval processes, as resources permit. A formal risk assessment is underway and is expected to be complete by the end of 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control 

There has been no change in our internal control
procedures over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting. 

22 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

From time to time, we may become involved in legal
proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings
that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,
financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement
costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Investing in our securities involves a high
degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks, together with all the other information in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the following risks actually materializes,
our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our
common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. The following information updates, and should be read in
conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, contained in our 2023 Form
10-K. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

We have incurred
losses from our continuing operations every year and quarter since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses
from our continuing operations in the future. 

We are a clinical stage biotechnology pharmaceutical
company that is focused on the discovery and development of medications for the treatment of addictions and related disorders of AUD in
patients with certain targeted genotypes. We have a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is
highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate
will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. We
have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur
significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. To date, we have not generated positive cash
flow from operations, revenues, or profitable operations, nor do we expect to in the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we
had an accumulated deficit of approximately 79.9 million and as of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately
 68.8 million. Our current cash and cash equivalents are not expected to be sufficient to fund operations for the twelve months from the
date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are only anticipated to be sufficient to fund our needs into the second half of
2025, based our current projections and current commitments. Implementation of our full development plans would exhaust our cash on hand
more quickly. Therefore, despite the funding we have recently received, we will need to engage in additional fundraising in the near term
as we carry out our development plans. We do not have any fixed commitments of financing and there can be no assurance that we will be
able to meet the conditions for continued sales pursuant to the ATM Agreement. In addition, there is no assurance that funds could be
raised before we have expended our current cash on hand on acceptable terms to continue our operations and AD04 development projects. 

Even if we succeed in
commercializing our product candidate or any future product candidates, we expect that the commercialization of our product will not begin
until 2027 or later, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional
product candidates and will continue to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flow. We may encounter unforeseen expenses,
difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses
will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected
future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our shareholders equity and working capital. 

Our independent registered public accounting
firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as do our notes to financial statements included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. 

The
report of our independent registered public accounting firm contains a note stating that the accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of
 11.1 million and used 5.5 million 
of cash in operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a net loss of 5.1
million and used cash in operations of 6.8 million. Losses have principally occurred as a result of the research and development
efforts coupled with no operating revenue. The notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q state that we do not believe that the existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund operations for the
next twelve months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our significant accumulated deficit, recurring losses,
and needs to raise additional funds to sustain its operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Even
if we succeed in commercializing our product candidate or any future product candidates, we expect that the commercialization of our
product will not begin until 2026 or later, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to
develop and market additional product candidates and will continue to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flow. 

23 

One
of our officers may have a conflict of interest. 

Two
of our officers are currently working for our company on a part-time basis and we expect that they will continue to do so. Our employment
agreement with our Chief Financial Officer provides that he will devote 75 of his business time to our matters, with his remaining business
time devoted to other matters including, without limitation, employment at other companies that are non-competitive with us, which may
result in a lack of availability when needed due to responsibilities with other requirements. Our agreement with our Chief Operating
Officer is that he will devote 75 of his business time to our matters, which may result in a lack of availability when needed due to
responsibilities with other requirements. 

Future
sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans and outstanding
warrants, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. 

We
expect that significant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including conducting clinical
trials, commercialization efforts, expanded research and development activities and costs associated with operating a public company.
To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and
in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may
be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors
could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our common stock. Pursuant to our 2017 equity incentive plan,
which became effective on the business day prior to the public trading date of our common stock, our management is authorized to grant
equity awards to our employees, officers, directors and consultants. 

Initially,
the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that might be issued pursuant to stock awards under our 2017 equity incentive plan
was 70,000 shares, which has been since increased to 500,000 at our 2023 Annual Stockholders Meeting, and of which 212,565 remain available
for grant as of the date hereof. At our 2024 Annual Stockholders Meeting, our stockholders approved a proposal to increase the number
of shares that we will have approval to grant under the 2017 equity incentive plan by 1,500,000 shares. Increases in the number of shares
available for future grant or purchase may result in additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to decline. 

At
September 30, 2024 and as of the date of this filing, we had outstanding (i) warrants to purchase 4,201,568 shares of common stock outstanding
with a weighted average exercise price of 8.45, and (ii) options to purchase 343,971 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise
price of 21.98 per share. The issuance of the shares of common stock underlying the options and warrants will have a dilutive effect
on the percentage ownership held by holders of our common stock. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds. 

(a) Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 

We did not sell any equity securities during the
three months ended September 30, 2024 in transactions that were not registered under the Securities Act other than as disclosed in our
filings with the SEC. 

(b) Use of Proceeds 

Not applicable. 

(c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

Not applicable. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities . 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 

Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer
of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, 
as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
