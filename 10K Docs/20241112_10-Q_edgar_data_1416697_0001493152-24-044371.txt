Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying

ITEM
 2. MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Report. 

We
were originally incorporated in Nevada on September 11, 2006, under the name The Engraving Masters, Inc. (the Company ). 

On
May 2, 2014, we changed our name to Blue Line Protection Group, Inc. 

On
February 8, 2021, our directors approved a 100-for-1 reverse split of our common stock. The reverse stock split became effective in the
public market in July 2021. 

We
provide armed protection and transportation, currency processing, compliance and training services for businesses engaged in the legal
cannabis industry. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 approximately 57.6 of our revenue was derived from transportation
services. The remaining 42.4 of our revenue was derived from currency processing services (41.3 and compliance services (1.1 ). 

Our
operations are based out of the Denver, Colorado and Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan areas. Our corporate headquarters are located at 5765
Logan Street, Denver, CO 80216. 

Principal
Services 

Cultivation
facilities are the producers of legal cannabis that eventually make its way to consumers. Growers operations typically span a
large geographic footprint, making them susceptible to theft, as are shipments from the growers to testing laboratories or to retail
dispensaries. Additionally, due to current federal marijuana legislation and banking environment, growers are finding it increasingly
difficult to secure their cash, purchase equipment and obtain financing for expansion. 

Dispensaries
are the retail face of the legal cannabis industry. All legal sales of cannabis products are transacted through dispensaries that are
state-licensed. To maintain their licenses, dispensaries must comply with a variety of state-mandated reporting requirements, including
reporting every gram of cannabis passing in and out of the store. Dispensaries also face financing and banking challenges similar to
those that growers encounter. 

We
do not grow, test or sell cannabis. 

Our
services cover the following: 

Armed
Protection and Transportation 

Fundamental
to the legal cannabis industry is the protection of product and cash throughout the distribution channel. Manufacturers ship samples
of their product to independent laboratories where the samples are tested for compliance with state-mandated parameters. If the samples
are in compliance, the product is then shipped to the retail dispensaries, where it is sold to the public. 

Due
to the current banking and regulatory environments, payments between each step in the distribution network are predominantly made in
cash from the customer. Therefore, these businesses are forced into having to transport bags of money between growers and dispensaries
and their own vaults or storage facilities. 

The
risk of theft of cash and product is present at every stage, even when they are not in transit. Accordingly, all cannabis businesses
require security measures to prevent theft, mitigate risk to employees and maintain regulatory compliance. 

We
began our security and protection operations in Colorado in February 2014. Since that time, we have become one of the largest legal cannabis
protection services companies in the state. We offer a fully integrated approach to managing the movement of cannabis and cash from growers
through dispensaries via armed and armored transport, currency processing, vaulting and related credit. Currency processing services
generally include counting, sorting and wrapping currency. 

4 

In
2018 we expanded our operations into Arizona and Nevada, and in 2022 we began servicing the New Mexico market. 

We
currently supply asset protection via armored transportation and currency processing services to licensees in Colorado, Arizona, Nevada
and New Mexico, out of our two business locations. We are focused on encompassing all compliance needs on behalf of our clients, as mandated
by the State and Federal authorities for the protection, transport and sale of cannabis. 

Banking 

The
banking system in the U.S. is, in most states, federally regulated. Possession or distribution of marijuana violates federal law, and
banks that provide support for those activities face the risk of prosecution and assorted sanctions. Currently, almost all payments for
the sales of cannabis are made in cash, due the inability of sellers to obtain merchant processing accounts. As a result, processing
money from marijuana sales puts federally insured banks at risk of drug trafficking and racketeering charges, so they ve refused
to open accounts for marijuana-related businesses. 

Marijuana
businesses that can t use banks may have too much cash they can t safely put away, leaving them vulnerable to criminals.
Jurisdictions that allow cannabis sales want a channel to receive taxes, so safely securing cash is of paramount importance. 

In
February 2014, the Obama administration gave banks a road map for conducting transactions with cannabis sellers operating within state
regulations so these companies can deposit cash, make payroll and pay taxes like a traditional business. The move was designed to let
financial institutions serve such businesses while ensuring that they know their customers legitimacy and remain obligated to
report possible criminal activity. Various safe banking proposals have circulated through Congress, but none have been
passed to date. Also, on April 30, 2024, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration announced its intent to reschedule cannabis as a less
dangerous drug under the Controlled Substances Act (Schedule I to Schedule III). While a historic shift to generations of American drug
policy, this act would not by itself solve the cannabis industry s banking troubles either. 

We
have created a means for the banks to validate compliance with the federal mandate mentioned above. Currently only a security company
could match the compliance requirements as only we can vertically integrate the source of funds through the Federally required 12 steps,
summarized as from grow, to sale, (to those of approved age or license), to purchaser, to funds received, to where the funds were held,
to vault, to third party validation, to tax, to profits, to access to the banking system etc. We are uniquely positioned, through a number
of partnership and cooperation agreements, to provide banking solutions to our clients. 

Compliance 

Laws
concerning business procedures and practices are changing across the nation. It s hard to keep up with all the changes, and business
owners have to balance their day-to-day operations with remaining compliant with and responsive to regulatory agencies. Blue Line Protection
Group provides daily on-site compliance verification to ensure that local business owners are operating lawful and inspection-ready establishments.
Our security experts, trained in crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) techniques, can provide crucial
advice about enhancing the interior and exterior security of your establishment. 

We
communicate regularly with local and national government representatives to ensure that we remain the top-tier security and protection
group in the states where we do business. Retail establishments aren t the only ones who have to remain compliant with the pertinent
laws - we do, as well. 

With
the addition of our compliance module clients can be confident they will not lose their license for some small or large error by their
staff that might put their cannabis license in jeopardy. Their license being, in most instances, their most valuable asset. We are relieving
them of several burdens they are ill suited to comply with. (Most licensees were formally acting outside the law prior to the legislation
and have little to no compliance experience). 

5 

Training 

Many
of our security personnel have established military or police backgrounds. We ensure our employees are prepared to offer clients, their
staff and customers a safe and secure environment. All members of our armored transportation team and security operators are required
to undertake our mandatory, rigorous 40-hour introductory compliance and training curriculum created and supervised by veteran law enforcement
officers. They also undergo required annual training and firearm requalification to maintain proper licensing. 

We
also offer businesses, houses of worship and the general public a wide variety of safety, security and personal defense courses and firearms
training. 

Growth
Strategy 

1. Expand
 into new markets to establish first-mover advantages. 
 
 2. Market
 ourselves through strategic alliances and affiliations. 
 
 3. Acquire
 or joint venture with guard and alarm businesses throughout the USA if they represent good
 value and a good fit with our expansion plans. Organic growth will not suffice for the rapid
 growth of this industry and our ability to provide service immediately requires variations
 of this strategy. 
 
 4. Increase
 our client base to the participants in the cannabis value chain. Offering our superior chain
 of control compliance and software. 
 
 5. Develop
 and offer value-added, complementary or supplementary services. 

The
development of the legal markets for cannabis is a function of state legislation. As a result, while specific markets may not be currently
available, we actively monitor the progress of legislation and know with some degree of certainty when new geographic markets will be
coming on line. This allows us to target our limited sales and marketing resources to those new markets. In this way, we believe the
current legislative environment works in our favor - if the whole country were currently a potential market our limited resources would
result in an inability to effectively cover all potential market territories. With limited markets open we can better cover those available
territories. 

Industry
Background 

The
total market for marijuana, is estimated to exceed the economic value of corn and wheat combined. Marijuana is widely considered the
largest cash crop in the United States. Businesses have been positioning themselves for years, each trying to establish a leadership
position in the legal cannabis industry, projected to reach as high as 37 billion in retail sales by 2024. 

Properties 

We
lease our offices in Denver, Colorado pursuant to a lease which expires on October 26, 2026. We have the option to extend the term of
the lease for two additional five-year periods. The lease requires rental payments of approximately 11,487 per month which increases
2 annually. 

We
lease our offices in Phoenix, Arizona pursuant to a lease which expires on May 31, 2028. We have the option to extend the term of the
lease for one additional five-year period. The lease requires rental payments of approximately 6,380 per month which increases 4 annually. 

We
also offer security monitoring, asset vaulting, and VIP and dignitary protection.

As

During
the next twelve months, we anticipate that we will incur approximately 1,200,000 of general and administrative expenses in order to
execute our current business plan. We also plan to incur significant sales, marketing, research and development expenses during the next
12 months. We will need additional financing to pay for the expenses described above. We may not be able to obtain the additional funding
we require on terms that are favorable to us or at all. 

Other
than as disclosed above, we do not anticipate any material capital requirements for the twelve months ending September 30, 2025. 

Other
than as disclosed above, we do not know of any: 

trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that
will result in, or that are reasonable likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way; or 

any significant changes in our expected sources and uses of
cash. 

We
do not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with any equity capital. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Management
considers the following policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results,
and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. 

7 

Accounts
receivable. Accounts receivable are stated at the amount we expect to collect from outstanding balances and do not bear interest.
We provide for probable uncollectible amounts through an allowance for doubtful accounts if an allowance is deemed necessary. The allowance
for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable; however, changes
in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future. On a periodic basis,
management evaluates our accounts receivable and determines the requirement for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment
of the current and collectible status of individual accounts with past due balances over 90 days. Account balances are charged against
the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. 

Revenue
recognition . In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which
supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU
is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional
disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant
judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASC 606-10-50-5 requires
that entities disclose disaggregated revenue information in categories (such as type of good or service, geography, market, type of contract,
etc.) that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow are affected by economic factors. ASC 606-10-55-89
explains that the extent to which an entity s revenue is disaggregated depends on the facts and circumstances that pertain to the
entity s contracts with customers and that some entities may need to use more than one type of category to meet the objective for
disaggregating revenue. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard
by one year, and allowed entities the option to early adopt the new revenue standard as of the original effective date. There have been
multiple standards updates amending this guidance or providing corrections or improvements on issues in the guidance. The requirements
for these standards relating to Topic 606 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. This standard
permitted adoption using one of two transition methods, either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. 

We
adopted these standards at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of
these standards did not have an impact on our Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Stock-based
compensation. We record stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 505 and 718, which requires us to recognize
expenses related to the fair value of our employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions
using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. We recognize
the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award. 

Equity
Instruments. We account for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from non-employees in accordance
with FASB ASC 718-10. 

ITEM
 4. CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

An
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Financial Officer
and Principal Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this report on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedures are procedures designed with the objective of ensuring that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and is communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that
evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to
the material weaknesses identified during the audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Change
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
