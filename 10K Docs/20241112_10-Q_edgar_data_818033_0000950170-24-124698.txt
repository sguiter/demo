t transferred any investment securities between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. As of September 30, 2024 , cash equivalents included million of available-for-sale securities with contractual maturities of three months or less and short-term investments included million of available-for-sale securities with contractual maturities of three months to one year. As of December 31, 2023 , cash equivalents included million of available-for-sale securities with contractual maturities of three months or less and short-term investments included million of available-for-sale securities with contractual maturities of three months to one year. The money market funds as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 are included in cash and cash equivalents on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. A company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts receivable, available-for-sale securities, accounts payable, guarantees and issued debt, among others. If the use of fair value is elected, any upfront costs and fees related to the item such as debt issuance costs must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred. The fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument-by-instrument basis, even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings and any changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. We have elected to not apply the fair value option to our financial assets and liabilities. Financial instruments, including cash, cash equivalents, receivables, inventory, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at cost, which is considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. Short-term available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value. Our notes payable and convertible notes payable outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 do not have a readily available ascertainable market value; however, their carrying value, which is measured at carrying value less unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts, is considered to approximate their fair value.

 square feet of laboratory and office space in San Diego, California, with a lease term that expires on . In October 2021, we entered into a sublease agreement to sublet square feet of laboratory and office space. The space was delivered to the subtenant in March 2022. As a result of the sublease agreement, our one five-year this lease on expiration applies only with respect to our remaining square feet of laboratory and office space.

million with tranched availability as follows: million at closing tranche 1A ), million available through December 15, 2024 tranche 1B ), and million available from the earlier of: (1) the full draw of tranche 1B and (2) the expiration of tranche 1B, and available through December 15, 2025 tranche 1C ), and in the case of tranches 1B and 1C, subject to certain customary conditions to draw down. , with a springing maturity date that is prior to the stated maturity of our Notes (as defined below) (if still outstanding at such time). The loans thereunder do not have any scheduled amortization payments and accrue interest at a floating rate equal to, per annum, payable in cash on a monthly basis and upon maturity or payoff. In addition, under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the loans also accrue paid-in-kind interest at a fixed-rate of per annum which is due upon maturity or payoff. In addition, in connection with the tranche 1A funding, we issued warrants to the Lenders to purchase up to shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share (the "Lender Warrants"). The Lender Warrants are equal to of the principal amount of tranche 1A loans funded by the Lenders (the Warrant Coverage ). The Loan Agreement also requires that we issue additional warrants to the Lenders at the time of each draw down of tranches 1B and 1C with the same Warrant Coverage. Each Lender Warrant is exercisable for seven years from the date of issuance. The Loan Agreement contains a minimum cash covenant, beginning on the closing date, requiring us to hold cash of no less than million, if our market capitalization is less than million. The Loan Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. We were in compliance with all covenants of the Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2024. The Loan Agreement was accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 470, Debt, ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The initial tranche 1A funding of million and the Lender Warrants are accounted for as freestanding debt and equity financial instruments, respectively, as they are legally detachable and separately exercisable. The additional borrowings available under the Loan Agreement plus the additional warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, which would be issued concurrently, are accounted for as a single freestanding financial instrument that are not assets or obligations of ours; this financial instrument meets the loan commitment derivative scope exception and will be accounted for when and if we borrow additional tranches in the future. The initial funding of million was recorded as a liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the Loan Agreement, we recognized the initial Lender Warrants at their relative fair value of million, and we incurred debt issuance costs of million, both of which were recorded as debt discounts. The debt discounts and the end of term fee, of million, are being amortized and accreted into interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Loan Agreement, resulting in an effective interest rate of . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , interest expense related to the Loan Agreement was million and million, respectively, which included million and million, respectively, related to the stated interest rate, million and million, respectively, related to paid-in-kind interest, and million and million, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discounts and accretion of the end of term fee. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , interest expense related to the Loan Agreement was million, which included million related to the stated interest rate, and million related to paid-in-kind interest. As of September 30, 2024 , the carrying value of tranche 1A was million, which is comprised of the million principal amount outstanding, million of accumulated paid-in-kind interest, less debt discounts of million. The end of term fee accreted as of September 30, 2024 , of million is recorded in other accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes In May 2021, we entered into a note purchase agreement with funds affiliated with Baker Bros. Advisors LP for a private placement of million in Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes (the Notes ). We received a total of million, net of issuance costs, from the issuance of the Notes.

per annum, payable in cash in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on . The Notes mature on , unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The Notes are subject to redemption at our option, between May 24, 2024 and May 24, 2025, but only if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for a specified period of time, or will be subject to redemption at our option on or after May 24, 2025 if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon conversion, we will settle the Notes in shares of our common stock. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is shares per principal amount of the Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of common stock). If a holder of the Notes converts upon a make-whole fundamental change or company redemption, the holder may be eligible to receive a make-whole premium through an increase to the conversion rate. In May 2021, we filed a registration statement with the SEC to register for resale million shares of our common stock underlying the Notes, including the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable under the make-whole premium. The Notes were accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options ASC 470-20 ), and ASC Subtopic 815-40, Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ASC 815-40 ). Under ASC 815-40, to qualify for equity classification (or non-bifurcation, if embedded), the instrument (or embedded feature) must be both (1) indexed to the issuer s stock and (2) meet the requirements of the equity classification guidance. Based upon our analysis, it was determined that the Notes do contain embedded features indexed to our common stock, but do not meet the requirements for bifurcation, and therefore do not need to be separately accounted for as an equity component. Since the embedded conversion feature meets the equity scope exception from derivative accounting, and, also since the embedded conversion option does not need to be separately accounted for as an equity component under ASC 470-20, the proceeds received from the issuance of the Notes were recorded as a liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We incurred issuance costs related to the Notes of million, which we recorded as debt issuance costs and are included as a reduction to the Notes on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The debt issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Notes, resulting in an effective interest rate of . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , interest expense related to the Notes was million and million, respectively, which included million and million, respectively, related to the stated interest rate and million and million, respectively, related to the amortization of debt issuance costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , interest expense related to the Notes was million and million, respectively, which included million and million, respectively, related to the stated interest rate and million and million, respectively, related to the amortization of debt issuance costs. As of September 30, 2024 , the carrying value of the Notes was million, which is comprised of the million principal amount of the Notes outstanding, less debt issuance costs of million. 

 million shares of our common stock in a private placement at a purchase price of per share. In addition, as a component of the July 2023 Private Placement, we sold million pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share (the "July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants"). The July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of per share. The total net proceeds from the sale of the common stock and the July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants was million (net of million in issuance costs). The July 2023 Private Placement closed on July 25, 2023. In August 2023, we filed a registration statement with the SEC to register for resale million shares of our common stock issued to the Purchasers. The registration statement was declared effective on August 31, 2023.

Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on improving the lives of patients by developing and commercializing therapeutic innovations that improve medical care. Our advanced science, patented technologies, and innovative approach to drug discovery and development have allowed us to create and commercialize a portfolio of products that aim to advance the standard of care for acute care and oncology patients. 
 Acute Care Product Portfolio 
 Our Acute Care Product Portfolio consists of ZYNRELEF, which is approved in the U.S. for the management of postoperative pain and APONVIE, which is approved in the U.S. for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. 
 ZYNRELEF 
 ZYNRELEF was initially approved by the FDA in May 2021, and we commenced commercial sales in the U.S. in July 2021. In each of December 2021 and January 2024, the FDA approved an expansion of ZYNRELEF's indication. ZYNRELEF is approved for small-to-medium open abdominal, lower extremity total joint arthroplasty, soft tissue and orthopedic surgical procedures including foot and ankle, and other procedures in which direct exposure to articular cartilage is avoided. 
 ZYNRELEF is a dual-acting local anesthetic that delivers a fixed-dose combination of the local anesthetic bupivacaine and a low dose of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam. ZYNRELEF is the first and only modified-release local anesthetic to be classified by the FDA as an extended-release product because ZYNRELEF demonstrated in Phase 3 studies significantly reduced pain and significantly increased proportion of patients requiring no opioids through the first 72 hours following surgery compared to bupivacaine solution, the current standard-of-care local anesthetic for postoperative pain control. 
 In September 2024, the FDA approved the prior approval supplement PAS for the addition of a vial access needle VAN in the ZYNRELEF co-packaged combination product kit. The introduction of the VAN will replace the current vented vial spike and has the potential to simplify aseptic preparation, while also significantly reducing ZYNRELEF's withdrawal time down to between twenty and forty-five seconds. The user-friendly "container-like" design of the VAN may enhance the safe use of ZYNRELEF, increase adoption, and improve the preparation process. The VAN is expected to be available for use in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In January 2024, we entered into a five-year distributor partnership with CrossLink to expand the sales network supporting ZYNRELEF. CrossLink will be the lead partner in the U.S. to expand ZYNRELEF promotion for orthopedic indications. The partnership will launch in several phases, initially at a regional level, followed by an expanded national rollout. In total, we anticipate that approximately 650 representatives will be added to Heron s sales network over 2024. 
 In March 2022, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS approved a 3-year transitional pass-through status of ZYNRELEF, which became effective on April 1, 2022, for separate reimbursement outside of the surgical bundle payment in the Hospital Outpatient Department setting of care. In addition, in December 2022, H.R. 2617, the omnibus spending bill was approved by Congress. The bill includes the Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation (NOPAIN) Act which directs CMS to provide separate Medicare reimbursement for non-opioid treatments that are used to manage pain during surgeries conducted in hospital outpatient departments or in ambulatory surgical centers. To qualify, the non-opioid treatment must demonstrate the ability to replace, reduce, or avoid intraoperative or postoperative opioid use or the quantity of opioids prescribed in a clinical trial or through data published in a peer-reviewed journal. The hospital outpatient prospective payment system and ambulatory surgical center proposed rule for calendar year 2025 includes ZYNRELEF as a qualifying non-opioid requiring CMS to provide separate Medicare reimbursement in both the hospital outpatient department and ambulatory surgical center settings from January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2027. 
 APONVIE 
 APONVIE was approved by the FDA in September 2022 and became commercially available in the U.S. in March 2023. APONVIE is indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting PONV in adults. CMS granted pass-through payment status for APONVIE, effective April 1, 2023. 
 APONVIE is the first and only intravenous formulation of a substance P/neurokinin-1 NK1 receptor antagonist indicated for PONV. Delivered via a single 30-second intravenous IV injection, APONVIE has demonstrated rapid achievement of therapeutic drug levels ideally suited for the surgical setting. 
 20 

Oncology Care Product Portfolio 
 Our Oncology Care Product portfolio consists of SUSTOL and CINVANTI, which are both approved in the U.S. for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. 
 SUSTOL 
 SUSTOL was approved by the FDA in August 2016, and we commenced commercial sales in the U.S. in October 2016. 
 SUSTOL is indicated in combination with other antiemetics in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens. SUSTOL is an extended-release, injectable 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that utilizes our Biochronomer Technology to maintain therapeutic levels of granisetron for 5 days. The SUSTOL global Phase 3 development program was comprised of two, large, guideline-based clinical studies that evaluated SUSTOL s efficacy and safety in more than 2,000 patients with cancer. SUSTOL s efficacy in preventing nausea and vomiting was evaluated in both the acute phase (0 24 hours following chemotherapy) and the delayed phase (24 120 hours following chemotherapy). 
 SUSTOL is the first extended-release 5-HT3 receptor antagonist approved for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with both MEC and AC combination chemotherapy regimens. A standard of care in the treatment of breast cancer and other cancer types, AC regimens are among the most commonly prescribed HEC regimens, as defined by both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network NCCN and the American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO ). 
 In February 2017, the NCCN included SUSTOL as a part of its NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Antiemesis Version 1.2017. The NCCN has given SUSTOL a Category 1 recommendation, the highest-level category of evidence and consensus, for use in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting in patients receiving HEC or MEC regimens. The guidelines now identify SUSTOL as a preferred agent for preventing nausea and vomiting following MEC. Further, the guidelines highlight the unique, extended-release formulation of SUSTOL. 
 In January 2018, a product-specific billing code, or permanent J-code J-code ), for SUSTOL became available. The new J-code was assigned by CMS and has helped simplify the billing and reimbursement process for prescribers of SUSTOL. 
 CINVANTI 
 CINVANTI was approved by the FDA in November 2017, and we commenced commercial sales in the U.S. in January 2018. In each of February 2019 and October 2019, the FDA approved an expansion of CINVANTI of its administration and indication, respectively. 
 CINVANTI, in combination with other antiemetic agents, is indicated in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (HEC) including high-dose cisplatin as a single-dose regimen, delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (MEC) as a single-dose regimen, and nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC as a 3-day regimen. 
 CINVANTI is an IV formulation of aprepitant, a substance NK1 receptor antagonist. CINVANTI is the first IV formulation to directly deliver aprepitant, the active ingredient in EMEND capsules. Aprepitant (including its prodrug, fosaprepitant) is a single-agent NK1 receptor antagonist to significantly reduce nausea and vomiting in both the acute phase (0 24 hours after chemotherapy) and the delayed phase (24 120 hours after chemotherapy). CINVANTI is the first IV formulation of an NK1 receptor antagonist indicated for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with HEC and nausea and vomiting associated with MEC that is free of synthetic surfactants, including polysorbate 80. 
 NK1 receptor antagonists are typically used in combination with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Unlike CINVANTI many other injectable NK1 receptor antagonists currently approved in the U.S. for both acute and delayed chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting CINV ), EMEND IV (fosaprepitant), contains polysorbate 80, a synthetic surfactant, which has been linked to hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and infusion site reactions. The CINVANTI formulation does not contain polysorbate 80 or any other synthetic surfactant. Our CINVANTI data has demonstrated the bioequivalence of CINVANTI to EMEND IV, supporting its efficacy for the prevention of both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with HEC and nausea and vomiting associated with MEC. Results also showed CINVANTI was better tolerated in healthy volunteers than EMEND IV, with significantly fewer adverse events reported with CINVANTI. 
 21 

In January 2019, a J-code for CINVANTI became available. The new J-code was assigned by CMS and has helped simplify the billing and reimbursement process for prescribers of CINVANTI. 
 Biochronomer Technology 
 Our proprietary Biochronomer Technology is designed to deliver therapeutic levels of a wide range of otherwise short-acting pharmacological agents over a period from days to weeks with a single administration. Our Biochronomer Technology consists of polymers that have been the subject of comprehensive animal and human toxicology studies that have shown evidence of the safety of the polymer. When administered, the polymers undergo controlled hydrolysis, resulting in a controlled, sustained release of the pharmacological agent encapsulated within the Biochronomer-based composition. Furthermore, our Biochronomer Technology is designed to permit more than one pharmacological agent to be incorporated, such that multimodal therapy can be delivered with a single administration. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, inventory and the related reserves, accrued research and development expenses, income taxes and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Our critical accounting estimates include: revenue recognition, investments, inventory and the related reserves, accrued research and development expenses, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates disclosures included in our 2023 Annual Report.

Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net Product Sales 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net product sales were 32.8 million and 103.5 million, respectively, compared to 31.4 million and 92.8 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. 
 Net Product Sales Acute Care 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net product sales of ZYNRELEF were 6.3 million and 17.1 million, respectively, compared to 4.4 million and 12.0 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net product sales of APONVIE were 1.1 million and 2.6 million, respectively, compared to 0.3 million and 0.9 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The increase in net product sales for both ZYNRELEF and APONVIE is attributed to an increase in the units sold in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Net Product Sales Oncology Care 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net product sales of CINVANTI were 22.6 million and 73.2 million, respectively, compared to 23.3 million and 70.6 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net product sales of SUSTOL were 2.8 million and 10.6 million, respectively, compared to 3.4 million and 9.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in net product sales for CINVANTI for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023 is attributed to an increase in units sold, offset by increased gross to net adjustments. The decrease in net product sales for SUSTOL for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023 is attributed to a decrease in units sold. The increase in net product sales for both CINVANTI and SUSTOL for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 is attributed to an increase in the units sold. 
 Cost of Product Sales 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of product sales was 9.5 million and 28.4 million, respectively, compared to 18.2 million and 55.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. Cost of product sales primarily included raw materials, labor and overhead related to the manufacturing of our Products, as well as shipping and distribution costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of product sales included charges of 0.8 million and 2.4 million, respectively relating to reserves and write-offs of inventory. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, cost of product sales included charges of 7.5 million and 20.3 million, respectively, relating to the write-off of inventory. The remaining decrease in cost of product sales is attributed to a decrease in cost per units for CINVANTI and ZYNRELEF, as large-scale manufacturing was validated and approved in late 2022. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expense consisted of the following (in thousands):

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expense was 4.5 million and 13.5 million, respectively, compared to 9.3 million and 31.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to our decreased headcount and related costs as a result of the restructuring implemented in 2023, as well as a decrease in non-cash, stock-based compensation expense. The decrease is also due to decreases in costs related to ZYNRELEF, as large-scale manufacturing was approved in 2022, and APONVIE, as a result of the product becoming commercially available in March 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expense was 12.4 million and 41.3 million, respectively, compared to 15.9 million and 51.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to our decreased headcount and related costs as a result of the restructuring implemented in 2023 and operational efficiencies. 
 Sales and Marketing Expense 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expense was 11.0 million and 36.0 million, respectively, compared to 13.0 million and 55.3 million, respectively, for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to our decreased headcount and related costs as a result of the restructuring implemented in 2023 and operational efficiencies. 
 Other (Expense) Income, Net 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, other expense, net was 0.4 million and 1.5 million, respectively, compared to other (expense) income, net of 0.1) million and 0.6 million, respectively, for the same period in 2023. The increase in other expense, net is attributed to increased interest expense as a result of the working capital facility agreement entered into in August 2023 (see Note 8 for further discussion of our working capital facility agreement) and the write-off of property and equipment during the three months ended June 30, 2024, which was associated with a project for which we had a one-time settlement related to a legal dispute. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company's short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from funding (i) sales and marketing expenses, (ii) general and administrative expenses including salaries, bonuses and commissions, (iii) working capital requirements, and (iv) research and development expenses, and (v) payments related to our outstanding convertible notes. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 70.9 million. Based on our current operating plan and projections, management believes that the Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and working capital facility, will be sufficient to meet the Company's anticipated cash requirements for a period of at least the next twelve months from the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. Our future cash requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, primarily including our ability to generate revenue and the scope and costs of our commercial and research and development activities. 
 Our net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.8 million, or 0.03 per share, and 17.2 million, or 0.11 per share, respectively, compared to 25.0 million, or 0.17 per share, and 99.8 million, or 0.75 per share, respectively, for the same period in 2023. 
 Our net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 10.7 million and 61.2 million, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net loss as a result of decreases in operating spend and stock-based compensation expenses, primarily as a result of the restructuring implemented in 2023, the 4.3 million of write-offs of property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and changes in working capital, specifically accounts receivable due to timing of collections, inventory as a result of write-offs incurred, prepaid assets due to the timing of payments, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, including payroll and employee liabilities due to the timing of payments and reduced headcount. 
 Our net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 was 7.3 million, and 26.8 million, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to net maturities of short-term investments of 8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 28.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 24 

Our net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 was 0.5 million, and 53.9 million, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities is a result of proceeds from the 2023 private placement and note financing, which did not recur in 2024. 
 Historically, we have financed our operations, including technology and product research and development, primarily through sales of our common stock, product sales and debt financings.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Not required for smaller reporting companies. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such time. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEG AL PROCEEDINGS 
 Except as discussed below, there are no material changes from the legal proceedings previously disclosed in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 On June 14, 2022, the Company received a Notice Letter (the Fresenius Kabi Notice from Fresenius Kabi advising that Fresenius Kabi had submitted an ANDA to the FDA seeking approval to manufacture, use or sell a generic version of CINVANTI in the U.S. prior to the expiration of U.S. Patent Nos.: 9,561,229; 9,808,465; 9,974,742; 9,974,793; 9,974,794; 10,500,208; 10,624,850; 10,953,018; and 11,173,118 (the CINVANTI Patents ), which are listed in the FDA s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book ). The Fresenius Kabi Notice alleges that the CINVANTI Patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of the generic product described in Fresenius Kabi s ANDA. On July 27, 2022, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement of the CINVANTI Patents against Fresenius Kabi and a related entity in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in response to Fresenius Kabi s ANDA filing.

The Mylan August Notice alleges that the CINVANTI Patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of the generic product described in Mylan s ANDA for a generic version of CINVANTI. On September 15, 2023, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement of the CINVANTI Patents against Mylan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in response to the filing of Mylan s ANDA for a generic version of CINVANTI. The complaint seeks, among other relief, equitable relief enjoining Mylan from infringing the CINVANTI Patents. On November 9, 2023, the Company received an updated Notice Letter from Mylan advising that it had submitted an amendment to Mylan s ANDA to include a paragraph IV certification to Heron s recently listed U.S. Patent No. 11,744,800. The parties completed fact discovery and are progressing into expert discovery. A five-day bench trial is scheduled for May 19, 2025. The Company intends to vigorously enforce its intellectual property rights relating to CINVANTI. As a result of filing our complaint for patent infringement, the FDA may not approve Mylan s ANDA for a generic version of CINVANTI until the earlier of February 4, 2026 or resolution of the litigation.

The Mylan December Notice Letter alleges that the APONVIE Patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of the generic product described in Mylan s ANDA for a generic version of APONVIE. On January 11, 2024, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement of the APONVIE Patents against Mylan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in response to Mylan filing an ANDA for a generic version of APONVIE. The complaint seeks, among other relief, equitable relief enjoining Mylan from infringing the APONVIE Patents. On January 26, 2024, the Court consolidated this litigation concerning Mylan s ANDA for a generic version of APONVIE with the previously-filed litigation concerning Mylan s ANDA for a generic version of CINVANTI. Accordingly, a five-day bench trial is scheduled for May 19, 2025. The Company intends to vigorously enforce its intellectual property rights relating to APONVIE. As a result of filing our complaint for patent infringement, the FDA may not approve Mylan s ANDA for a generic version of APONVIE until the earlier of June 16, 2026 or resolution of the litigation.

As a result of filing our complaint for patent infringement, the FDA may not approve Slayback's NDA until the earlier of June 12, 2026, or resolution of the litigation. 
 ITEM 1A. RIS K FACTORS 
 We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, the risks and uncertainties that we believe are most important for you to consider are discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Other than the factors set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We face intense competition from other companies developing products for the management of postoperative pain or the prevention of CINV and PONV. 
 ZYNRELEF competes in the postoperative pain management market with MARCAINETM (bupivacaine hydrochloride injection, solution, marketed by Pfizer Inc.) and generic forms of bupivacaine; NAROPIN (ropivacaine, marketed by Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC) and generic forms of ropivacaine; EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension, marketed by Pacira BioSciences, Inc.); XARACOLL (bupivacaine HCl implant, marketed by Innocoll Pharmaceuticals Limited); POSIMIR (owned by Durect Corporation and to be marketed in the U.S. by Innocoll Pharmaceuticals Limited); ANJESO (meloxicam injection, marketed by Baudax Bio, Inc.); OFIRMEV (acetaminophen injection, marketed by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals); SEGLENTIS (celecoxib and tramadol hydrochloride, marketed by Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. in the U.S.); generic forms of IV acetaminophen; and potentially other products in development for postoperative pain management that reach the U.S. market. 
 APONVIE competes in the PONV prevention market with generic ondansetron, the current standard of care, generic aprepitant, and BARHEMSYS (amisulpride, marketed by Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc.); TAK-951 (a peptide agonist under development (PH2) by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for PONV and not approved anywhere globally for any use); and potentially other products in development for PONV prevention that reach the market. 
 CINVANTI faces significant competition. NK1 receptor antagonists are administered for the prevention of CINV, in combination with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, to augment the therapeutic effect of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Currently available NK1receptor antagonists include: generic versions of EMEND IV (fosaprepitant); EMEND IV (fosaprepitant, marketed by Merck Co., Inc.); EMEND (aprepitant, marketed by Merck Co., Inc.); AKYNZEO (palonosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, combined with netupitant, an NK1 receptor antagonist, marketed by Helsinn Therapeutics (U.S.), Inc.); VARUBI (rolapitant, marketed by TerSera Therapeutics LLC), FOCINVEZ TM (fosaprepitant injection, marketed by Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC) and other products that include an NK1 receptor antagonist that reach the market for the prevention of CINV. 
 SUSTOL faces significant competition. Currently available 5-HT3 receptor antagonists include: AKYNZEO (palonosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, combined with netupitant, an NK1 receptor antagonist, marketed by Helsinn Therapeutics (U.S.), Inc.); SANCUSO (granisetron transdermal patch, marketed by Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc.); and generic products including ondansetron (formerly marketed by GlaxoSmithKline plc as ZOFRAN), granisetron (formerly marketed by Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. as KYTRIL), palonosetron (formerly marketed by Eisai in conjunction with Helsinn Healthcare S.A. as ALOXI) and Posfrea (Palonosetron Injection, marketed by AVYXA). Currently, palonosetron is the only 5-HT3receptor antagonist other than SUSTOL that is approved for the prevention of delayed CINV associated with MEC regimens. SUSTOL is indicated in combination with other antiemetics in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens, which is considered to be a HEC regimen by the NCCN and ASCO. No other 5-HT3 receptor antagonist is specifically approved for the prevention of delayed CINV associated with a HEC regimen. 
 28 

Small or early-stage companies and research institutions may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established pharmaceutical companies. We will also face competition from these parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and acquiring and in-licensing technologies and products complementary to our programs or potentially advantageous to our business. If any of our competitors succeed in obtaining approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for their product candidates sooner than we do for our product candidates that are more effective or less costly than ours, our commercial opportunity could be significantly reduced. Major technological changes can happen quickly in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the development of technologically improved or different products or drug delivery technologies may make our product candidates or platform technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
