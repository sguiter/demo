Environmental and Health 

Total time and materials revenues 

For fixed-price contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. The customer typically controls the work in process as evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by the Company s rights to payment for work performed to date to deliver services that do not have an alternative use to the Company. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to the Company s estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates it expects to

 of their annual bonus is settled with fully vested restricted stock unit awards. Under these fully vested restricted stock unit awards, the holder of each award has the right to receive one share of the Company s common stock for each fully vested restricted stock unit from the date of grant. Each individual who receives a fully vested restricted stock unit award is also granted a matching number of unvested restricted stock unit awards. Unvested restricted stock unit awards are also granted for select new hires and promotions. These unvested restricted stock unit awards generally cliff vest from the date of grant, at which time the holder of each award will have the right to receive one share of the Company s common stock for each restricted stock unit award provided the holder of each award has met certain employment conditions.

The value of these restricted stock unit awards is determined based on the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The value of fully vested restricted stock unit awards issued is recorded as a reduction to accrued bonuses.

and during the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense associated with accrued bonus awards of and , respectively. The value of the unvested restricted stock unit awards granted is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the four-year vesting period or the period between the grant date and the date the award recipient turns 59 . If the award recipient is 59 years or older on the date of grant, the value of the entire award is expensed upon grant. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense associated with the unvested restricted stock unit awards of and during the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively.

Unvested stock option awards will continue to vest in the case of retirement at 59 years or older, provided that the holder of each award does all consulting work through the Company and does not become an employee for a past or present client, beneficial party or competitor of the Company. The value of the unvested stock option awards granted is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the four-year vesting period or the period between the grant date and the date the award recipient turns 59 . If the award recipient is 59 years or older on the date of grant, the value of the entire award is expensed upon grant. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense associated with stock option grants o f and during the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense associated with stock option grants of and during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted. The determination of the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the award, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The Company used historical exercise, forfeiture, and post-vesting expiration data to estimate the expected term of options granted. The historical volatility of the Company s common stock over a period of time equal to the expected term of the options granted was used to estimate expected volatility. The risk-free interest rate used in the option-pricing model was based on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the options. The dividend yield assumption considers the expectation of continued declaration of dividends, offset by option holders dividend equivalent rights. The Company accounts for forfeitures of stock-based awards when they occur. All stock-based payment awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses over the remaining contractual life of its receivables resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations or for disputes that affect the Company s ability to fully collect amounts due. In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations or aware of a dispute with a specific customer, a specific allowance is recorded to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. For all other customers the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical write-offs, customer concentration, customer creditworthiness, current economic conditions, aging of amounts due and future expectations.

Our land lease with the State of Arizona was extended on June 19, 2024. This extension resulted in additional non-cash rent expense of approximately 1,085,000 during the third quarter of 2024. This increased level of rent expense will continue through the extended lease term ending in January of 2043 with adjustments in 2033 and 2038 based on the consumer price index.

(65,972) 

We financed our business during the first nine months of 2024 through available cash. As of September 27, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 219,708,000 as compared to 187,150,000 at December 29, 2023. 
 Generally, our net cash provided by operating activities is used to fund our day to day operating activities. First quarter operating cash requirements are generally higher due to payment in the first quarter of our annual bonuses accrued during the prior year. Our largest source of operating cash flows is collections from our clients. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, leased facilities, taxes, and general operating expenses including marketing and travel. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was due to an increase in net income and a smaller increase in accounts receivable during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period last year. 
 The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same period last year, was due to a decrease in capital expenditures primarily due to leasehold improvements during 2023 associated with our office and lab space in Philadelphia. 
 The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same period last year, was due to a decrease in repurchases of our common stock and a reduction in payroll taxes for restricted stock units partially offset by an increase in dividends. 
 We expect to continue our investing activities, including capital expenditures. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase programs, pay dividends, or strategically acquire professional service firms that are complementary to our business. 
 We maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of a select group of highly compensated employees. Vested amounts due under the plan of 115,527,000 were recorded as a long-term liability on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 27, 2024. Vested amounts due under the plan of 12,195,000 were recorded as a current liability on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 27, 2024. Our assets that are earmarked to pay benefits under the plan are held in a rabbi trust and are subject to the claims of our creditors. As of September 27, 2024, invested amounts under the plan of 113,225,000 were recorded as a long-term asset on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of September 27, 2024, invested amounts under the plan of 13,569,000 were recorded as a current asset on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 On June 19, 2024, we entered into an agreement with the State of Arizona to extend our land lease for 15 years beginning on January 17, 2028. We are currently obligated to make payments under the lease of 1,009,000 per year, which obligation will continue at that level until January 16, 2028. Beginning on January 17, 2028, our payments under the lease will increase to approximately 6,183,000 per year for the 15-year extension term with adjustments to the annual rent payment in 2033 and 2038 based on the consumer price index. As a result of this extension, we added an additional right-of-use asset in exchange for an operating lease liability of 48,683,000 during the second quarter of 2024. 
 As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime. The 
 - 27 - 

maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("Non-GAAP") Financial Measures, and other U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of Non-GAAP financial information. Generally, a Non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We closely monitor two financial measures, EBITDA and EBITDAS, which meet the definition of Non-GAAP financial measures. We define EBITDA as net income before income taxes, net interest income, depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDAS as EBITDA before stock-based compensation. The Company regards EBITDA and EBITDAS as useful measures of operating performance to complement operating income, net income and other GAAP financial performance measures. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and EBITDAS provide meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results. These measures are used to evaluate our financial results, develop budgets and determine employee compensation. These measures, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, operating income, cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measure is set forth below. 
 The following table shows EBITDA (determined as shown in the reconciliation table below) as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023:

The increase in EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in utilization and a decrease in general and administrative expenses. Our utilization increased to 73 during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 70 during the same period last year. The increase in utilization was due to business activity for our proactive service offerings to the consumer electronics and utilities sectors and our successful efforts to align resources with demand. 
 
 The increase in EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the increase in utilization and a decrease in general and administrative expenses partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses. Our utilization increased to 75 during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 70 during the same period last year. The increase in utilization was due to business activity across the consumer products and utilities sectors and our successful efforts to align resources with demand.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our balances of cash and cash equivalents. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average effective maturities in accordance with our investment policy. The maximum effective maturity of any issue in our portfolio is 3 years and the maximum average effective maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed 12 months. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the change in the fair market value of our portfolio of cash equivalents would not have a material impact on our financial statements. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our portfolio. There have not been any material changes during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to our interest rate risk exposures, or how these exposures are managed. Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risk, there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. 
 We have foreign currency risk related to our revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British Pound, the Singapore Dollar, the Chinese Yuan, and the Hong Kong Dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect the revenues and net income of our foreign subsidiaries as expressed in U.S. dollars. 
 At September 27, 2024, we had net assets of approximately 22.7 million with a functional currency of the British Pound, net assets of approximately 4.5 million with a functional currency of the Singapore Dollar, net assets of approximately 1.8 million with a functional currency of the Chinese Yuan, and net assets of approximately 0.7 million with a functional currency of the Hong Kong Dollar associated with our operations in the United Kingdom, Singapore, China, and Hong Kong, respectively. 
 We also have foreign currency risk related to foreign currency transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on these foreign currency transactions and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. At September 27, 2024, we had net assets denominated in the non-functional currency of approximately 11.8 million. 
 We do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge any foreign currency exposures. To date, the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our consolidated revenues and consolidated net income have not been significant. However, our continued international growth increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of September 27, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 We review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis, to improve our controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future. Our goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to all material financial and non-financial information concerning our business. While we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve our goal, future events affecting our business may cause us to significantly modify our disclosure controls and procedures. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
