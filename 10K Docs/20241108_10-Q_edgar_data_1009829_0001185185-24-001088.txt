to of gross sales and are generally based upon product purchases or specific advertising campaigns. Such allowances are accrued when the related revenue is recognized. To the extent these cooperative advertising arrangements provide a distinct benefit at fair value, they are accounted for as direct selling expenses, otherwise they are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Further, while the Company generally does not allow product returns, the Company does make occasional exceptions to this policy and consequently records a sales return allowance based upon historic return amounts and management estimates. These allowances (variable consideration) are estimated using the expected value method and are recorded at the time of sale as a reduction to revenue. The Company adjusts its estimate of variable consideration at least quarterly or when facts and circumstances used in the estimation process may change. The variable consideration is not constrained as the Company has sufficient history on the related estimates and does not believe there is a risk of significant revenue reversal. 

Sales commissions are expensed when incurred as the related revenue is recognized at a point in time and therefore the amortization period is less than one year. As a result, these costs are recorded as direct selling expenses, as incurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 sales commissions were million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 sales commissions were million and million, respectively. 

Shipping and handling activities are considered part of the Company s obligation to transfer the products and therefore are recorded as direct selling expenses, as incurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, shipping and handling costs were million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, shipping and handling costs were million and million, respectively. 

The Company s reserve for sales returns and allowances amounted to million as of September 30, 2024, compared to million as of December 31, 2023. 

The Company s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were million and million, respectively.

million first-lien secured term loan (the Initial Term Loan and a million delayed draw term loan (the Delayed Draw Term Loan and collectively, the 2021 BSP Term Loan ). Net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 BSP Term Loan, after deduction of million in closing fees and million of other administrative fees paid directly to the lenders, totaled million. These fees are amortized over the life of the 2021 BSP Term Loan on a straight-line basis which approximates the effective interest method. Proceeds from the Initial Term Loan, together with available cash from the Company, were used to repay the Company s former term loan (the 2019 Recap Term Loan formerly known as the New Term Loan in prior filings) under the agreement dated as of August 9, 2019 with Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as agent for certain investor parties. The Delayed Draw Term Loan provision was designed to provide necessary capital to redeem any of the Company s outstanding convertible senior notes due 2023, upon their maturity, which, upon repayment of the 2019 Recap Term Loan, accelerated to no later than 91 days from the repayment of the 2019 Recap Term Loan, or September 1, 2021. On July 29, 2021, the Company terminated its Delayed Draw Term Loan option as it determined it had sufficient liquidity to fund any outstanding convertible senior notes that remained upon maturity. 

The 2021 BSP Term Loan Agreement contained negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limited the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge its assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, the Company was required to maintain a Net Leverage Ratio of 4:00x, with step-downs occurring each fiscal year starting with the quarter ending March 31, 2022 through the quarter ending September 30, 2024 in which the Company was required to maintain a Net Leverage Ratio of 3:00x. 

Amounts outstanding under the 2021 BSP Term Loan bore interest at either (i) LIBOR plus - (determined by reference to a net leverage pricing grid), . The 2021 BSP Term Loan was termed to mature in June 2027. 

The 2021 BSP Term Loan Agreement contained events of default that are customary for a facility of this nature, including (subject in certain cases to grace periods and thresholds) nonpayment of principal, nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violation of covenants, cross-default to certain other existing indebtedness, bankruptcy or insolvency events, certain judgment defaults and a change of control as specified in the 2021 BSP Term Loan Agreement. If an event of default occurred, the maturity of the amounts owed under the 2021 BSP Term Loan Agreement might have been accelerated. 

The obligations under the 2021 BSP Term Loan Agreement were guaranteed by the Company, the subsidiary borrowers thereunder and certain of the other existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company and were secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, the subsidiary borrowers thereunder and such other subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens and subject to the priority lien granted under the JPMorgan ABL Credit Agreement (see Note 6 Credit Facility). 

In January 2023, the Company entered into a second amendment for its 2021 BSP Term Loan Agreement, which transitioned the interest reference rate on its 2021 BSP Term Loan from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). The new interest reference rate for the 2021 BSP Term Loan was effective on April 1, 2023. In addition to the transition to SOFR, the amendment also included a constant spread adjustment until the maturity of the 2021 BSP Term Loan.

million prepayment towards the outstanding principal amount of the 2021 BSP Term Loan and incurred a million prepayment penalty and on March 3, 2023, as required by the terms within the 2021 BSP Term Loan Agreement under the Excess Cash Flow ECF Sweep provision, the Company had made a mandatory million payment towards the outstanding principal amount of the 2021 BSP Term Loan. 

On June 5, 2023, the Company paid in full the 2021 BSP Term Loan and terminated the 2021 BSP Term Loan Agreement by making a million prepayment towards the outstanding principal amount. Additionally, the Company made a million payment towards the outstanding accrued interest, and a million payment for the prepayment penalty and other related fees. In connection with this transaction, the Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of million on its condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

The agent and Sole Lead Arranger under the 2021 BSP Term Loan were affiliates of an affiliate of the Company, which affiliate, at the time of refinancing, owned common stock, and the convertible senior notes due 2023 of the Company as well as the Company s outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (see Note 16 Related Party Transactions). 

The fair value of the Company s 2021 BSP Term Loan was considered Level 3 fair value (see Note 15 Fair Value Measurements for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy) and was measured using the discounted future cash flow method. In addition to the debt terms, the valuation methodology included an assumption of a discount rate that approximated the current yield on a debt security with comparable risk. This assumption was considered an unobservable input in that it reflected the Company s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company believed that this was the best information available for use in the fair value measurement. 

senior secured revolving credit facility (the JPMorgan ABL Facility ). The JPMorgan ABL Credit Agreement replaced the Company s existing asset-based revolving credit agreement, dated as of March 27, 2014 (the Wells Fargo ABL Facility, formerly known as the Amended ABL Facility in prior filings), with General Electric Capital Corporation, since assigned to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Company pays a commitment fee - based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. Any amounts borrowed under the JPMorgan ABL Facility bore interest at either (i) LIBOR plus - (determined by reference to an excess availability pricing grid) or (ii) Alternate Base Rate plus - (determined by reference to an excess availability pricing grid and base rate subject to a 1.00 floor). The JPMorgan ABL Facility matures in June 2026. As of September 30, 2024 the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank was . 

In March 2023, the Company entered into a first amendment for its JPMorgan ABL Credit Agreement, which transitioned the interest reference rate on its JPMorgan ABL Facility from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). The new interest reference rate for the ABL Facility became effective on March 16, 2023. Any amounts borrowed under the JPMorgan ABL Facility will bear interest at either (i) SOFR plus - (determined by reference to an excess availability pricing grid) plus a constant spread adjustment or (ii) Alternate Base Rate plus - (determined by reference to an excess availability pricing grid and base rate subject to a 1.00 floor). 

The JPMorgan ABL Credit Agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge their assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Under certain circumstances the Company is also subject to a springing fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of not less than to , as described in more detail in the JPMorgan ABL Credit Agreement.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Net Sales 

Toys/Consumer Products. Net sales of our Toys/Consumer Products segment were 264.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 246.0 million for the prior year period, representing an increase of 18.3 million, or 7.4 . Net sales from the Action Play Collectibles division were up 5.5 in part due to higher net sales from the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie and core product lines. 

Costumes . Net sales of our Costumes segment were 57.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 63.7 million for the prior year period, representing a decrease of 6.4 million, or 10.0 . The decrease in net sales was primarily due to reduced orders from select recurring customers informed in part by the prior year s sell-through during the Halloween shopping season. 

Cost of Sales 

Toys/Consumer Products. Cost of sales of our Toys/Consumer Products segment was 171.8 million, or 65.0 of related net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 156.9 million, or 63.8 of related net sales for the prior year period, representing an increase of 14.9 million, or 9.5 . The increase as a percentage of net sales was due to higher product cost as well as slightly higher inbound duty and freight expenses. 

Costumes . Cost of sales of our Costumes segment was 41.0 million, or 71.6 of related net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 45.9 million, or 72.1 of related net sales for the prior year period, representing a decrease in dollars of 4.9 million, or 10.7 . The decrease as a percentage of net sales was due to lower product cost. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 40.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 44.6 million for the prior year period constituting 12.6 and 14.4 of net sales, respectively. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to lower outbound freight and warehousing expenses. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense was 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.4 million in the prior year period. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred interest expense of 0.5 million related to our revolving credit facility. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred interest expense of 1.3 million related to discounting of some receivables and 0.1 million related to our revolving credit facility.

Provision For Income Taxes 

Our income tax expense, which includes federal, state and foreign income taxes and discrete items, was 15.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 22.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the comparable period in 2023, our income tax expense was 12.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 20.5 . The effective tax rate increased primarily due to non-deductible compensation and foreign inclusions. 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Net Sales 

Toys/Consumer Products. Net sales of our Toys/Consumer Products segment were 451.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 461.8 million for the prior year period, representing a decrease of 10.0 million, or 2.2 . Net sales from the Action Play Collectibles division were down 8.6 due to lower net sales in part from the Super Mario Movie TM which was released April 2023. 

Costumes . Net sales of our Costumes segment were 108.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 122.3 million for the prior year period, representing a decrease of 13.8 million, or 11.3 . The decrease in net sales was primarily due to reduced orders from select recurring customers informed in part by the prior year s sell-through during the Halloween shopping season. 

Cost of Sales 

Toys/Consumer Products. Cost of sales of our Toys/Consumer Products segment was 304.3 million, or 67.4 of related net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 303.1 million, or 65.6 of related net sales for the prior year period, representing an increase of 1.2 million, or 0.4 . The increase as a percentage of net sales was due to higher product cost offset by lower royalties. 

Costumes . Cost of sales of our Costumes segment was 78.5 million, or 72.4 of related net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 91.4 million, or 74.7 of related net sales for the prior year period, representing a decrease in dollars of 12.9 million, or 14.1 . The decrease in as a percentage of net sales was driven by lower product cost. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 123.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 115.2 million for the prior year period constituting 22.0 and 19.8 of net sales, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased full-time staff as we expand our international presence and associated marketing and travel expenses, as well as higher costs related to warehousing. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense was 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.7 million in the prior year period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred interest expense of 0.9 million related to our revolving credit facility.

Seasonality and Backlog 

The retail toy industry is inherently seasonal. Generally, our sales have been highest during the second and third quarters owing to our preference for the FOB (free-on-board)/DI (direct import) business model where our customers take possession of the product in Asia and are responsible for importing into their respective countries from that point forward, and collections for those sales have been highest during the succeeding third and fourth quarters. Our working capital needs have been highest during the second and third quarters as we make royalty advance payments for some of our licenses and buy and sell inventory subject to customer payment terms. 

While we have taken steps to level sales over the entire year, sales are expected to remain heavily influenced by the seasonality of our toy and costume products. The result of these seasonal patterns is that operating results and the demand for working capital may vary significantly by quarter. Orders placed with us are generally cancelable until the date of shipment. The combination of seasonal demand and the potential for order cancellation makes accurate forecasting of future sales difficult and causes us to believe that backlog may not be an accurate indicator of our future sales. Similarly, financial results for a particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the entire year. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital (inclusive of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash) of 130.4 million, compared to 106.1 million as of December 31, 2023, representing an increase in working capital of 24.3 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The increase in working capital is primarily attributable to the seasonal increases in inventory, accounts receivables, payables and accrued expenses by 71.3 million net, offset by the 20.0 million cash payment made to holders for the redemption of our outstanding preferred stock. The remaining decrease is mainly attributable to cash used in operating activities and other working capital usage. 

Operating activities used net cash of 15.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 87.7 million in the prior year period. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities year-over-year is primarily due to a decrease in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 5.7 million, an increase in cash taxes paid by 11.7 million and 80.5 million in other working capital changes. Other than open purchase orders issued in the normal course of business related to shipped product, we have no obligations to purchase inventory from our manufacturers. However, we may incur costs or other losses as a result of not placing orders consistent with our forecasts for product manufactured by our suppliers or manufacturers for a variety of reasons including customer order cancellations or a decline in demand. As part of our strategy to develop and market new products, we have entered into various character and product licenses with royalties/obligations generally ranging from 1 to 22 payable on net sales of such products. As of September 30, 2024, these agreements required future aggregate minimum royalty guarantees of 77.8 million exclusive of 0.9 million in advances already paid. Of this 77.8 million future minimum royalty guarantee, 47.8 million is due over the next twelve months. 

Investing activities used net cash of 9.0 million and 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and consisted primarily of cash paid for the purchase of molds and tooling used in the manufacture of our products and purchases of investments to fund our obligation to our employees stemming from our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. 

Financing activities used net cash of 26.5 million and 71.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consists of 20.0 million used in the redemption of our outstanding preferred stock and 6.5 million used in the repurchase of common stock for employee tax withholdings. The cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily consists of the repayment of our 2021 BSP Term Loan of 69.2 million and the repurchase of common stock for employee tax withholding of 2.5 million. 

As of September 30, 2024, we have no outstanding indebtedness under the JPMorgan ABL Facility, aside from utilizing 4.4 million in letters of credit. 

See Note 5 Debt and Note 6 Credit Facilities for additional information pertaining to our Debt and Credit Facilities.

Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of 22.3 million and 72.6 million, respectively. Cash, and cash equivalents, including restricted cash held outside of the United States in various foreign subsidiaries totaled 15.5 million and 21.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash balances in our foreign subsidiaries have either been fully taxed in the U.S. or tax has been accounted for in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or may be eligible for a full foreign dividends received deduction under such Act, and thus would not be subject to additional U.S. tax should such amounts be repatriated in the form of dividends or deemed distributions. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company declared a one-time dividend from Canada to the U.S in the amount of 5.9 million, in order to fund the preferred stock redemption that occurred during the quarter, resulting in a 5 withholding tax. This was a significant one-time event as there are no preferred stock outstanding after the redemption. Future cash remittances will come from Hong Kong, which does not impose withholding taxes. As such, foreign withholding taxes on future repatriations are not expected to be significant. 

Our primary sources of working capital are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our JPMorgan ABL Facility (see Note 6 Credit Facilities). 

Typically, cash flows from operations are impacted by the effect on sales of (1) the appeal of our products, (2) the success of our licensed brands in motivating consumer purchase of related merchandise, (3) the highly competitive conditions existing in the toy industry and in securing commercially attractive licenses, (4) dependency on a limited set of large customers, and (5) general economic conditions. A downturn in any single factor or a combination of factors could have a material adverse impact upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to operate the business. In addition, our business and liquidity are dependent to a significant degree on our vendors and their financial health, as well as the ability to accurately forecast the demand for products. The loss of a key vendor, or material changes in support by them, or a significant variance in actual demand compared to the forecast, can have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and business. Given the conditions in the toy industry environment in general, vendors, including licensors, may seek further assurances or take actions to protect against non-payment of amounts due to them. Changes in this area could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. 

As of September 30, 2024 off-balance sheet arrangements include letters of credit issued by JPMorgan of 4.4 million.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Interest Rate Risk 

Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our JPMorgan ABL Facility (see Note 6 Credit Facilities). Borrowings under our JPMorgan ABL Facility bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus 1.50 - 2.00 (determined by reference to an excess availability pricing grid) or (ii) Alternate Base Rate plus 0.50 - 1.00 (determined by reference to an excess availability pricing grid and base rate subject to a 1.00 floor). Borrowings under the JPMorgan ABL Facility are therefore subject to risk based upon prevailing market interest rates. Interest rate risk may result from many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control. 

In March 2023, we entered into an amendment to our JPMorgan ABL Credit Agreement which changed the interest reference rate on our revolving line of credit from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). 

Foreign Currency Risk 

We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Hong Kong, China, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Italy and Mexico. Sales are generally made by these operations on FOB China or Hong Kong terms and are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, purchases of inventory and Hong Kong operating expenses are typically denominated in Hong Kong dollars and local operating expenses in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Italy, Mexico and China are denominated in local currency, thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates. Changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our results of operations. We do not believe that near-term changes in these exchange rates, if any, will result in a material effect on our future earnings, fair values or cash flows. Therefore, we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions. We cannot assure you that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of these foreign currencies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report, have concluded that as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) that occurred during the period covered by this Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We are a party to, and certain of our property is the subject of, various pending claims and legal proceedings that routinely arise in the ordinary course of our business. We accrue for losses when the loss is deemed probable and the liability can reasonably be estimated. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to the pending litigation and revise our estimates. 

In the normal course of business, we may provide certain indemnifications and/or other commitments of varying scope to a) our licensors, customers and certain other parties, including against third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, and b) our officers, directors and employees, including against third-party claims regarding the periods in which they serve in such capacities with us. The duration and amount of such obligations is, in certain cases, indefinite. Our director s and officer s liability insurance policy may, however, enable us to recover a portion of any future payments related to our officer, director or employee indemnifications. For the past five years, costs related to director and officer indemnifications have not been significant. Other than certain liabilities recorded in the normal course of business related to royalty payments due to our licensors, no liabilities have been recorded for indemnifications and/or other commitments. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Risk factors with respect to us and our business are contained in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in such filing. The disclosures made in this Quarterly Report should be reviewed together with the risk factors contained therein.
