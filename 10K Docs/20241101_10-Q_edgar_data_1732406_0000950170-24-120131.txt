and of one LTC at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease in the amount of LTC represented by each Share is primarily a result of the periodic withdrawal of LTC to pay the Sponsor s Fee. The cost basis of investments in LTC recorded by the Trust is the fair value of LTC, as determined by the Trust, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date of transfer to the Trust by the Authorized Participant, or Liquidity Provider, based on the creation Baskets. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of each Share to investors. The Authorized Participant or Liquidity Provider may realize significant profits buying, selling, creating, and, if permitted, redeeming Shares as a result of changes in the value of Shares or LTC. At this time, the Trust is not operating a redemption program and is not accepting redemption requests. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. The Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program.

on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the Trust to shareholders would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of the Trust s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Trust has defined the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. As of, and during the periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Trust did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax amounts. However, the Sponsor s conclusions concerning its determination of more-likely-than-not tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, further implementation guidance, and ongoing analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Sponsor of the Trust has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions related to federal, state and local income taxes existed as of September 30, 2024 or June 30, 2024 . 

 and Shares of the Trust were held by related parties of the Trust, respectively. Genesis Global Trading, Inc. filed a certificate of dissolution during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and has therefore been removed from the list of related parties. The Sponsor s indirect parent, an affiliate of the Trust, holds a minority interest in Coinbase, Inc., the parent company of the Custodian, that represents less than of Coinbase , Inc. s ownership. In accordance with the Trust Agreement governing the Trust, the Trust pays a fee to the Sponsor, calculated as of the aggregate value of the Trust s assets, less its liabilities (which include any accrued but unpaid expenses up to, but excluding, the date of calculation), as calculated and published by the Sponsor or its delegates in the manner set forth in the Trust Agreement (the Sponsor s Fee ). The Sponsor s Fee accrues daily in U.S. dollars and is payable in LTC, monthly in arrears. The amount of LTC payable in respect of each daily U.S. dollar accrual will be determined by reference to the same U.S. dollar value of LTC used to determine such accrual. For purposes of these financial statements, the U.S. dollar value of LTC is determined by reference to the Digital Asset Trading Platform Market that the Trust considers its principal market as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each valuation date. The Trust held Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 . Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currencies have been distributed in payment of the Sponsor s Fee during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As partial consideration for receipt of the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor is obligated under the Trust Agreement to assume and pay all fees and other expenses incurred by the Trust in the ordinary course of its affairs, excluding taxes, but including marketing fees; administrator fees, if any; custodian fees; transfer agent fees; trustee fees; the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any secondary market (including customary legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) in an amount up to in any given fiscal year; ordinary course legal fees and expenses; audit fees; regulatory fees, including, if applicable, any fees relating to the 

 12 

in any given fiscal year and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters (collectively Additional Trust Expenses ). In such circumstances, the Sponsor or its delegate (i) will instruct the Custodian to withdraw from the Digital Asset Account LTC, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses and (ii) may either (x) cause the Trust (or its delegate) to convert such LTC, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency into U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies at the Actual Exchange Rate or (y) when the Sponsor incurs such expenses on behalf of the Trust, cause the Trust (or its delegate) to deliver such LTC, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in kind to the Sponsor, in each case in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Trust incurred Sponsor s Fees of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 , there were accrued and unpaid Sponsor s Fees. In addition, the Sponsor may pay Additional Trust Expenses on behalf of the Trust, which are reimbursable by the Trust to the Sponsor. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Sponsor did t pay any Additional Trust Expenses on behalf of the Trust. On March 2, 2022, the Board of the Sponsor (the Board approved the purchase by DCG, the indirect parent company of the Sponsor, of up to million worth of Shares of the Trust. Subsequently, DCG authorized such purchase. The Share purchase authorization does not obligate DCG to acquire any specific number of Shares in any period, and may be expanded, extended, modified, or discontinued at any time. From March 2, 2022 through March 31, 2022, DCG purchased a total of million worth of Shares of the Trust under this authorization. From April 1, 2022 through September 30, 2024 , DCG had t purchased any Shares of the Trust under this authorization.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our unaudited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report, or in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements or other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. 
 Trust Overview 
 The Trust is a passive entity that is managed and administered by the Sponsor and does not have any officers, directors or employees. The Trust holds LTC and, from time to time on a periodic basis, issues Creation Baskets in exchange for deposits of LTC. As a passive investment vehicle, the Trust s investment objective is for the value of the Shares (based on LTC per Share) to reflect the value of LTC held by the Trust, determined by reference to the Index Price, less the Trust s expenses and other liabilities. While an investment in the Shares is not a direct investment in LTC, the Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to LTC. To date, the Trust has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of LTC held by the Trust, less the Trust s expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, which at times have been substantial. The Trust is not managed like a business corporation or an active investment vehicle. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Investment Transactions and Revenue Recognition 
 The Trust considers investment transactions to be the receipt of LTC for Share creations and the delivery of LTC for Share redemptions or for payment of expenses in LTC. At this time, the Trust is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. The Trust records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for the Sponsor s Fee in LTC. 
 Principal Market and Fair Value Determination 
 To determine which market is the Trust s principal market (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for purposes of calculating the Trust s net asset value in accordance with U.S. GAAP Principal Market NAV ), the Trust follows Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurement , which outlines the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for LTC in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Trust to assume that LTC is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. 
 The Trust only receives LTC in connection with a creation order from the Authorized Participant (or a Liquidity Provider) and does not itself transact on any Digital Asset Markets. Therefore, the Trust looks to market-based volume and level of activity for Digital Asset Markets. The Authorized Participant(s), or a Liquidity Provider, may transact in a Brokered Market, a Dealer Market, Principal-to-Principal Markets and Exchange Markets (referred to as Trading Platform Markets in this Quarterly Report), each as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary (collectively, Digital Asset Markets ). 
 In determining which of the eligible Digital Asset Markets is the Trust s principal market, the Trust reviews these criteria in the following order: 
 First, the Trust reviews a list of Digital Asset Markets that maintain practices and policies designed to comply with anti-money laundering AML and know-your-customer KYC regulations, and non-Digital Asset Trading Platform Markets that the Trust reasonably believes are operating in compliance with applicable law, including federal and state licensing requirements, based upon information and assurances provided to it by each market. 

Second, the Trust sorts these Digital Asset Markets from high to low by market-based volume and level of activity of LTC traded on each Digital Asset Market in the trailing twelve months. 

16 

Third, the Trust then reviews pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Digital Asset Markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular Digital Asset Market. 

Fourth, the Trust then selects a Digital Asset Market as its principal market based on the highest market-based volume, level of activity and price stability in comparison to the other Digital Asset Markets on the list. Based on information reasonably available to the Trust, Trading Platform Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. The Trust therefore looks to accessible Trading Platform Markets as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market. As a result of the aforementioned analysis, a Trading Platform Market has been selected as the Trust s principal market. 

The Trust determines its principal market (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine (i) if there have been recent changes to each Digital Asset Market s trading volume and level of activity in the trailing twelve months, (ii) if any Digital Asset Markets have developed that the Trust has access to, or (iii) if recent changes to each Digital Asset Market s price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Trust s determination of its principal market. 
 The cost basis of LTC received in connection with a creation order is recorded by the Trust at the fair value of LTC at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the creation date for financial reporting purposes. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of the corresponding Shares to investors. 
 Investment Company Considerations 
 The Trust is an investment company for U.S. GAAP purposes and follows accounting and reporting guidance in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies . The Trust uses fair value as its method of accounting for LTC in accordance with its classification as an investment company for accounting purposes. The Trust is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material.

(1) Net assets in the above table and subsequent paragraphs are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP based on the Digital Asset Market price of LTC on the Digital Asset Trading Platform that the Trust considered its principal market, as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. 

Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in LTC for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 13,264), which includes a realized loss of 287) on the transfer of LTC to pay the Sponsor s Fee and net change in unrealized depreciation on investment in LTC of 12,977). Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in LTC for the period was driven by LTC price depreciation from 74.60 per LTC as of June 30, 2024, to 67.29 per LTC as of September 30, 2024. Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was 14,034) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized loss on investment in LTC, plus the Sponsor s Fee of 770. Net assets decreased to 127,514 at September 30, 2024, a 5 decrease for the three-month period. The decrease in net assets resulted from the aforementioned LTC price depreciation and the withdrawal of approximately 11,607 LTC to pay the foregoing Sponsor s Fee, partially offset by the contribution of approximately 112,598 LTC with a value of 7,715 to the Trust in connection with Share creations during the period. 
 Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in LTC for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 58,713), which includes a realized loss of 143) on the transfer of LTC to pay the Sponsor s Fee and net change in unrealized depreciation on investment in LTC of 58,570). Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in LTC for the period was driven by LTC price depreciation from 105.38 per LTC as of June 30, 2023, to 66.31 per LTC as of September 30, 2023. Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was 59,453) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized loss on investment in 
 17 

LTC, plus the Sponsor s Fee of 740. Net assets decreased to 99,214 at September 30, 2023, a 37 decrease for the three-month period. The decrease in net assets resulted from the aforementioned LTC price depreciation and the withdrawal of approximately 9,458 LTC to pay the foregoing Sponsor s Fee. 
 Cash Resources and Liquidity 
 The Trust has not had a cash balance at any time since inception. When selling LTC, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in the Digital Asset Market to pay Additional Trust Expenses on behalf of the Trust, the Sponsor endeavors to sell the exact amount of LTC, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than LTC. As a consequence, the Sponsor expects that the Trust will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period. Furthermore, the Trust is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report was the Sponsor s Fee. The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs.

(1) The Trust performed an assessment of the principal market at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and identified the principal market as Coinbase. 

(2) As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Principal Market NAV per Share was calculated using the fair value of LTC based on the price provided by Coinbase, the Digital Asset Trading Platform that the Trust considered its principal market, as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. Prior to February 7, 2024, Principal Market NAV was referred to as NAV and Principal Market NAV per Share was referred to as NAV per Share. 

(3) The Trust s NAV per Share is derived from the Index Price, as represented by the Index as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. The Trust s NAV per Share is calculated using a non-GAAP methodology where the price is derived from multiple Digital Asset Trading Platforms. Prior to February 7, 2024, NAV was referred to as Digital Asset Holdings and NAV per Share was referred to as Digital Asset Holdings per Share. See Item 1. Business Overview of the LTC Industry and Market LTC Value The Index and the Index Price in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the Index and the Index Price. The Digital Asset Trading Platforms included in the Index as of September 30, 2024 were Coinbase, Crypto.com, Kraken and LMAX Digital. On October 27, 2024, the Index Provider added Bitstamp to the Index due to the trading platform meeting the Index Provider s minimum liquidity requirement, and did not remove any Constituent Trading Platforms as part of its scheduled quarterly review. The Digital Asset Trading Platforms included in the Index as of September 30, 2023 were Coinbase, Kraken, and LMAX Digital. See Item 1. Business Valuation of LTC and Determination of NAV in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the Trust s NAV per Share.

For accounting purposes, the Trust reflects creations and the LTC receivable with respect to such creations on the date of receipt of a notification of a creation but does not issue Shares until the requisite amount of LTC is received. At this time, the Trust is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval from the SEC and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. The Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Trust had a net closing balance with a value of 127,609,542, based on the Index Price (non-GAAP methodology). As of September 30, 2024, the Trust had a total market value of 127,514,792, based on the Digital Asset Market price of LTC on the Trust s principal market (Coinbase). 
 As of September 30, 2023, the Trust had a net closing balance with a value of 99,213,680, based on the Index Price (non-GAAP methodology). As of September 30, 2023, the Trust had a total market value of 99,213,680, based on the Digital Asset Market price of LTC on the Trust s principal market (Coinbase). 
 Historical NAV and LTC Prices 
 As movements in the price of LTC will directly affect the price of the Shares, investors should understand recent movements in the price of LTC. Investors, however, should also be aware that past movements in the LTC price are not indicators of future movements. Movements may be influenced by various factors, including, but not limited to, government regulation, security breaches experienced by service providers, as well as political and economic uncertainties around the world. 
 The following chart illustrates the movement in the Trust s NAV per Share versus the Index Price and the Trust s Principal Market NAV per Share from March 1, 2018 to September 30, 2024. For more information on the determination of the Trust s NAV, see Item 1. Business Overview of the LTC Industry and Market LTC Value The Index and the Index Price in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 The following table illustrates the movements in the Index Price from October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2024. During such period, the Index Price has ranged from 32.16 to 371.71, with the straight average being 94.41 through September 30, 2024. The Sponsor

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION: 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Sponsor and an affiliate of the Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ), are currently parties to certain legal proceedings. Although the Trust is not a party to these proceedings, the Trust may in the future be subject to legal proceedings or disputes. 
 On January 30, 2023, Osprey Funds, LLC Osprey filed a suit in Connecticut Superior Court against the Sponsor alleging that statements the Sponsor made in its advertising and promotion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. On April 17, 2023, the Sponsor filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and, following briefing, a hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on June 26, 2023. On October 23, 2023, the Court denied the Sponsor s motion to dismiss. On November 6, 2023, the Sponsor filed a motion for reargument of the Court s order denying the Sponsor s motion to dismiss. On November 16, 2023, Osprey filed an opposition to the Sponsor s motion for reargument, and on November 30, 2023, the Sponsor filed a reply in further support of its motion for reargument. On March 11, 2024, the Court denied the Sponsor s motion for reargument. On March 25, 2024, the Sponsor filed an application for interlocutory appeal. On March 28, 2024, Osprey filed an opposition to the Sponsor s application for interlocutory appeal. On April 1, 2024, the Court denied the Sponsor s application for interlocutory appeal. On April 10, 2024, Osprey filed a motion to amend the complaint. The amended complaint went into effect on April 25, 2024. A scheduling order was entered by the Court with trial scheduled to begin on July 15, 2025. On July 31, 2024, the Sponsor filed a motion to strike the amended complaint. On August 30, 2024, Osprey filed an opposition to the Sponsor s motion to strike the amended complaint. On October 11, 2024, the Court denied the Sponsor s motion to strike. The Sponsor and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against it. 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Sponsor does not expect the foregoing proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Trust s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The Sponsor and/or the Trust may be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes in the future. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors last reported under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the registrant s Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as set forth below. 
 A determination that LTC or any other digital asset is a security may adversely affect the value of LTC and the value of the Shares, and result in potentially extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to, or termination of, the Trust. 
 Depending on its characteristics, a digital asset may be considered a security under the federal securities laws. The test for determining whether a particular digital asset is a security is complex and difficult to apply, and the outcome is difficult to predict. Public, though non-binding, statements by senior officials at the SEC have indicated that the SEC did not consider Bitcoin or Ether to be securities, and does not currently consider Bitcoin to be a security. In addition, the SEC, by action through delegated authority approving the exchange rule filings to list shares of trusts holding Ether as commodity-based exchange-traded products, has implicitly taken the view that Ether is a commodity that is not a security. The SEC staff has also provided informal assurances via no-action letter to a handful of promoters that their digital assets are not securities. On the other hand, the SEC has brought enforcement actions against the issuers and promoters of several other digital assets on the basis that the digital assets in question are securities. More recently, the SEC has also brought enforcement actions against Digital Asset Trading Platforms for allegedly operating unregistered securities exchanges on the basis that certain of the digital assets traded on their platforms are securities. 
 For example, in June 2023, the SEC brought charges against Binance (the Binance Complaint and Coinbase (the Coinbase Complaint ), alleging violations of a variety of securities laws. In its complaints, the SEC asserted that SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, COTI, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH and NEXO, are securities under the federal securities laws. DASH is a fork of LTC and thus shares certain similarities with LTC. In addition, in November 2023, the SEC brought the Kraken Complaint, alleging that Kraken operated as an unregistered securities exchange, brokerage and clearing agency. 
 Whether a digital asset is a security under the federal securities laws depends on whether it is included in the lists of instruments making up the definition of security in the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act. Digital assets as such do not appear in any of these lists, although each list includes the terms investment contract and note, and the SEC has typically analyzed whether a particular digital asset is a security by reference to whether it meets the tests developed by the federal courts interpreting these terms, known as the Howey and Reves tests, respectively. For many digital assets, whether or not the Howey or Reves tests are met is difficult to resolve definitively, and substantial legal arguments can often be made both in favor of and against a particular digital asset qualifying as a security under one or both of the Howey and Reves tests. Adding to the complexity, the SEC staff has indicated that the 
 23 

security status of a particular digital asset can change over time as the relevant facts evolve, though recent arguments advanced in ongoing litigation may suggest that the SEC no longer believes the status of a digital asset can change over time. 
 As part of determining whether LTC is a security for purposes of the federal securities laws, the Sponsor takes into account a number of factors, including the various definitions of security under the federal securities laws and federal court decisions interpreting elements of these definitions, such as the U.S. Supreme Court s decisions in the Howey and Reves cases and their progeny, as well as reports, orders, press releases, public statements and speeches by the SEC, its commissioners and its staff providing guidance on when a digital asset may be a security for purposes of the federal securities laws. Finally, the Sponsor discusses the security status of LTC with external counsel, and has received a memorandum regarding the status of LTC under the federal securities laws from external counsel. Through this process the Sponsor believes that it is applying the proper legal standards in determining that LTC is not a security in light of the uncertainties inherent in the Howey and Reves tests. 
 In light of these uncertainties and the fact-based nature of the analysis, the Sponsor acknowledges that the SEC may take a contrary position; and the Sponsor s conclusion, even if reasonable under the circumstances, would not preclude legal or regulatory action based on the presence of a security. 
 As is the case with LTC, analyses from counsel typically review the often-complex facts surrounding a particular digital asset s underlying technology, creation, use case and usage development, distribution and secondary-market trading characteristics as well as contributions and of marketing or promotional efforts by the individuals or organizations who appear to be involved in these activities, among other relevant facts, usually drawing on publicly available information. This information, usually found on the internet, often includes both information that originated with or is attributed to such individuals or organizations, as well as information from third-party sources and databases that may or may not have a connection to such individuals or organizations, and the availability and nature of such information can change over time. The Sponsor and counsel often have no independent means of verifying the accuracy or completeness of such information, and therefore of necessity usually must assume that such information is materially accurate and complete for purposes of the Howey and Reves analyses. After having gathered this information, counsel typically analyzes it in light of the Howey and Reves tests, in order to inform a judgment as to whether or not a federal court would conclude that the digital asset in question is or is not a security for purposes of the federal securities laws. Often, certain factors appear to support a conclusion that the digital asset in question is a security, while other factors appear to support the opposite conclusion, and in such a case counsel endeavors to weigh the importance and relevance of the competing factors. This analytical process is further complicated by the fact that, at present, federal judicial case law applying the relevant tests to digital assets is limited and in some situations inconsistent, with no federal appellate court having considered the question on the merits, as well as the fact that because each digital asset presents its own unique set of relevant facts, it is not always possible to directly analogize the analysis of one digital asset to another. Because of this factual complexity and the current lack of a well-developed body of federal case law applying the relevant tests to a variety of different fact patterns, the Sponsor has not in the past received, and currently does not expect that it would be able to receive, opinions of counsel stating that a particular digital asset is or is not a security for federal securities law purposes. The Sponsor understands that as a matter of practice, counsel is generally able to render a legal opinion only when the relevant facts are substantially ascertainable and the applicable law is both well-developed and settled. As a result, given the relative novelty of digital assets, the challenges inherent in fact-gathering for particular digital assets, and the fact that federal courts have only recently been tasked with adjudicating the applicability of federal securities law to digital assets, the Sponsor understands that at present counsel is generally not in a position to render a legal opinion on the securities law status of LTC or any other particular digital asset. 
 As such, notwithstanding the Sponsor s receipt of a memorandum regarding the status of LTC under the federal securities laws from external counsel and the Sponsor s view that LTC is not a security, the SEC or a federal court may in the future take a different view as to the security status of LTC. 
 If the Sponsor determines that LTC is a security under the federal securities laws, whether that determination is initially made by the Sponsor itself, or because a federal court upholds an allegation that LTC is a security, the Sponsor does not intend to permit the Trust to continue holding LTC in a way that would violate the federal securities laws (and therefore would either dissolve the Trust or potentially seek to operate the Trust in a manner that complies with the federal securities laws, including the Investment Company Act). Because the legal tests for determining whether a digital asset is or is not a security often leave room for interpretation, for so long as the Sponsor believes there to be good faith grounds to conclude that the Trust s LTC is not a security, the Sponsor does not intend to dissolve the Trust on the basis that LTC could at some future point be finally determined to be a security. 
 Any enforcement action by the SEC or a state securities regulator asserting that LTC is a security, or a court decision to that effect, would be expected to have an immediate material adverse impact on the trading value of LTC, as well as the Shares. This is because the business models behind most digital assets are incompatible with regulations applying to transactions in securities. If a digital asset is determined to be a security, it is likely to become difficult or impossible for the digital asset to be traded, cleared or custodied in the United States through the same channels used by non-security digital assets, which in addition to materially and adversely affecting the 
 24 

trading value of the digital asset is likely to significantly impact its liquidity and market participants ability to convert the digital asset into U.S. dollars. Any assertion that a digital asset is a security by the SEC or another regulatory authority may have similar effects. 
 For example, in 2020 the SEC filed a complaint against the issuer of XRP, Ripple Labs, Inc., and two of its executives, alleging that they raised more than 1.3 billion through XRP sales that should have been registered under the federal securities laws, but were not. In the years prior to the SEC s action, XRP s market capitalization at times reached over 140 billion. However, in the weeks following the SEC s complaint, XRP s market capitalization fell to less than 10 billion, which was less than half of its market capitalization in the days prior to the complaint. 
 Likewise, in the days following the announcement of the Binance Complaint and Coinbase Complaint, the price of various digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ether, and LTC, declined significantly and may continue to decline as these cases advance through the federal court system. Subsequently, in July 2023, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held that while XRP is not a security, certain sales of XRP to certain buyers (but not other types of sales to other buyers) amounted to investment contracts under the Howey test. The District Court entered a final judgment in the case on August 7, 2024. In October 2024, the SEC filed a notice of appeal. Moreover, also in July 2023, another judge in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, in litigation between the SEC and the issuer of the UST and LUNA digital assets, suggested that he disagreed with the approach underlying the XRP decision. The Binance Complaint, the Coinbase Complaint, the Kraken Complaint, and the SEC s actions against XRP s issuer and the issuer of the UST and LUNA digital assets, as well as seemingly inconsistent views of different district court judges, underscore the continuing uncertainty around which digital assets are securities and what the correct analysis is to determine each digital asset s status. For example, the conflicting district court opinions and analyses demonstrate that factors such as how long a digital asset has been in existence, how widely held it is, how large its market capitalization is, the manner in which it is offered, sold or promoted, and whether it has actual use in commercial transactions, ultimately may have limited to no bearing on whether the SEC, a state securities regulator or any particular court will find it to be a security. 
 In addition, if LTC is in fact a security, the Trust could be considered an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act, which could necessitate the Trust s liquidation. In this case, the Trust and the Sponsor may be deemed to have participated in an illegal offering of investment company securities and there is no guarantee that the Sponsor will be able to register the Trust under the Investment Company Act at such time or take such other actions as may be necessary to ensure the Trust s activities comply with applicable law, which could force the Sponsor to liquidate the Trust. 
 Moreover, whether or not the Sponsor or the Trust were subject to additional regulatory requirements as a result of any determination that the Trust s assets include securities, the Sponsor may nevertheless decide to terminate the Trust, in order, if possible, to liquidate the Trust s assets while a liquid market still exists. For example, in response to the SEC s action against the issuer of XRP, certain significant market participants announced they would no longer support XRP and announced measures, including the delisting of XRP from major Digital Asset Trading Platforms, resulting in the Sponsor s conclusion that it was likely to be increasingly difficult for U.S. investors, including Grayscale XRP Trust (XRP), an affiliate of the Trust, to convert XRP into U.S. dollars. The Sponsor subsequently dissolved Grayscale XRP Trust (XRP) and liquidated its assets. If the SEC or a federal court were to determine that LTC is a security, it is likely that the value of the Shares of the Trust would decline significantly. Furthermore, if a federal court upholds an allegation that LTC is a security, the Trust itself may be terminated and, if practical, its assets liquidated.
