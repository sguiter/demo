 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). Advances under the Revolving Credit Facility are tied to a borrowing base consisting of eligible credit card receivables and inventory, as reduced by certain reserves in effect from time to time. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, inventory appraisals and certain other diligence items are deferred, with reduced advance rates during the period that such appraisals have not been delivered. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Revolving Credit Facility expires on the earliest to occur of (i) September 16, 2027 or (ii) an event of default. 
 The Second Amendment also replaced the existing London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") provisions with Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") provisions which converted then outstanding LIBOR loans into SOFR loans and additionally makes a number of other revisions to other provisions of the Credit Agreement. Giving effect to the Second Amendment, outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility would accrue interest at floating rates plus an applicable margin ranging from to for SOFR loans and to for base rate loans, and letter of credit fees range from to , in each case based on the average availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.

million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from one or more Lenders (the "Accordion"). Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company obtained commitments from the Lenders that would allow the Company at its election (subject only to satisfaction of certain customary conditions such as the absence of any Event of Default), to increase the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate principal amount up to million within the Accordion. The entire amount of the Revolving Credit Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit and allows for swingline loans. 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that limit, absent lender approval, the ability of the Company and certain of its affiliates to, among other things, pay cash dividends, incur debt, create liens and encumbrances, redeem or repurchase stock, enter into certain acquisition transactions with affiliates, merge, dissolve, repay certain indebtedness, change the nature of the Company s business, enter sale or leaseback transactions, make investments or dispose of assets. In some cases, these restrictions are subject to certain negotiated exceptions or permit the Company to undertake otherwise restricted activities if it satisfies certain conditions. In addition, the Company will be required to maintain availability of not less than (i) of the lesser of (x) aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and (y) the borrowing base (the "loan cap") during the period that inventory appraisals have not been delivered as described above and (ii) at all other times of the loan cap. 
 If there exists an event of default or availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is less than of the loan cap, amounts in any of the Loan Parties or subsidiary guarantors' designated deposit accounts will be transferred daily into a blocked account held by the Agent and applied to reduce outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility (the "Cash Dominion Event"), so long as (i) such event of default has not been waived and/or (ii) until availability has exceeded of the loan cap for sixty ) consecutive calendar days (provided that such ability to discontinue the Cash Dominion Event shall be limited to two times during the term of the Credit Agreement). 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default including, among other things, failure to pay obligations when due, initiation of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, defaults on certain other indebtedness, change of control, incurrence of certain material judgments that are not stayed, satisfied, bonded or discharged within 30 days, certain ERISA events, invalidity of the credit documents, and violation of affirmative and negative covenants or breach of representations and warranties set forth in the Credit Agreement. Amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may become due upon events of default (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods). 
 All obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by 1616 Holdings and secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and 1616 Holdings.

to from the date of grant. The fair value of RSUs is the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. PSUs granted to date have vesting periods ranging from less than to from the date of grant. 
 PSUs that have a performance condition are subject to satisfaction of the applicable performance goals established for the respective grant. The Company periodically assesses the probability of achievement of the performance criteria and adjusts the amount of compensation expense accordingly. The fair value of these PSUs is the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Compensation is recognized over the vesting period and adjusted for the probability of achievement of the performance criteria. 
 PSUs that have a market condition based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to a pre-defined peer group are subject to multi-year performance objectives with vesting periods of approximately from the date of grant (if the applicable performance objectives are achieved). The fair value of these PSUs are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which utilizes multiple input variables such as (i) total shareholder return from the beginning of the performance cycle through the performance measurement date(s); (ii) volatility; (iii) risk-free interest rates; and (iv) the correlation of the pre-defined peer group's total shareholder return.

 Income tax expense Effective tax rate 
 The effective tax rates for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 were based on the Company s forecasted annualized effective tax rates and were adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the periods presented. The effective tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 was lower than the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023 primarily due to non-deductible expenses, partially offset by discrete items, which includes the impact of share-based accounting. The effective tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 was higher than the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023 primarily due to discrete items, which includes the impact of share-based accounting, partially offset by non-deductible expenses.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 You should read the following discussion together with Selected Financial Data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 and referred to herein as the "Annual Report," and the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The statements in this discussion regarding expectations of our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and in Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors." Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. 
 We operate on a fiscal calendar widely used by the retail industry that results in a given fiscal year consisting of a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31 of the following year. References to "fiscal year 2024" or "fiscal 2024" refer to the period from February 4, 2024 to February 1, 2025, which is a 52-week fiscal year. References to "fiscal year 2023" or "fiscal 2023" refer to the period from January 29, 2023 to February 3, 2024, which is a 53-week fiscal year. The fiscal quarters ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 refer to the thirteen weeks ended as of those dates. The year-to-date periods ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 refer to the thirty-nine weeks ended as of those dates. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period and results for any interim period may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year. 
 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts or present facts or conditions, such as statements regarding our future financial condition or results of operations, our prospects and strategies for future growth, the introduction of new merchandise, and the implementation of our marketing and branding strategies. Forward-looking statements frequently are identified by terms such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.

The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflect our views as of the date of this report about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause events or our actual activities or results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future events, results, actions, levels of activity, performance or achievements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report, as amended by the risk factors included in Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 the risks of cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, such as the failure to secure customers' confidential or credit card information, or other private data relating to our crew or our Company, including the costs associated with protection against or remediation of such incidents;

 Overview 
 Five Below, Inc. (collectively referred to herein with its wholly owned subsidiaries as "we," "us," or "our") is a rapidly growing specialty value retailer offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at the tween and teen customer. We offer a dynamic, edited assortment of exciting products, with most priced at 5 and below, including select brands and licensed merchandise across our category worlds. In fiscal 2019, we rolled out new pricing to our full chain, increasing prices on certain products over 5. Most of our products remain at 5 and below. As of November 2, 2024, we operated 1,749 sto res in 44 states. 
 We also offer our merchandise on the internet, through our fivebelow.com e-commerce website, offering home delivery and the option to buy online and pick up in store. Additionally, we sell merchandise through on-demand third-party delivery services to enable our customers to shop online and receive convenient delivery. All e-commerce sales, which includes shipping and handling revenue, are included in net sales and are included in comparable sales. Our e-commerce expenses will have components classified as both cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization). 
 
 How We Assess the Performance of Our Business 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. These key measures include net sales, comparable sales, cost of goods sold and gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) and operating income. 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales constitute gross sales net of merchandise returns for damaged or defective goods. Net sales consist of sales from comparable stores, non-comparable stores, and e-commerce, which includes shipping and handling revenue. Revenue from the sale of gift cards is deferred and not included in net sales until the gift cards are redeemed to purchase merchandise or as breakage revenue in proportion to the pattern of redemption of the gift cards by the customer. 
 Our business is seasonal and as a result, our net sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Net sales are usually highest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season. 
 Comparable Sales 
 Comparable sales include net sales from stores that have been open for at least 15 full months from their opening date, and e-commerce sales. Comparable stores include the following: 
 Stores that have been remodeled while remaining open; 
 Stores that have been relocated within the same trade area, to a location that is not significantly different in size, in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes; and 
 Stores that have expanded, but are not significantly different in size, within their current locations. 
 For stores that are relocated or expanded, the following periods are excluded when calculating comparable sales: 
 The period beginning when the closing store receives its last merchandise delivery from one of our shipcenters through: 
 the last day of the fiscal year in which the store was relocated or expanded (for stores that increased significantly in size); or 
 the last day of the fiscal month in which the store re-opens (for all other stores); and 
 20 

The period beginning on the first anniversary of the date the store received its last merchandise delivery from one of our shipcenters through the first anniversary of the date the store re-opened. 
 Comparable sales exclude the 53rd week of sales for 53-week fiscal years. In the 52-week fiscal year subsequent to a 53-week fiscal year, we exclude the sales in the non-comparable week from the same-store sales calculation on a restated calendar basis using the National Retail Federation's restated calendar comparing similar weeks. 
 Due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, comparable sales for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 are reported on a restated calendar basis. Reference to the "restated calendar" is based on using the National Retail Federation's restated calendar comparing similar weeks, which are the thirteen weeks from August 4, 2024 to November 2, 2024 as compared to the thirteen weeks from August 6, 2023 to October 28, 2023 and the thirty-nine weeks from February 4, 2024 to August 3, 2024 as compared to the thirty-nine weeks from February 5, 2023 to October 28, 2023. 
 There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales. As a result, data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding our comparable sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers. Non-comparable sales are comprised of new store sales, sales for stores not open for a full 15 months, and sales from existing store relocation and expansion projects that were temporarily closed (or not receiving deliveries) and not included in comparable sales. 
 Measuring the change in fiscal year-over-year comparable sales allows us to evaluate how we are performing. Various factors affect comparable sales, including: 
 consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends; 
 our ability to identify and respond effectively to customer preferences and trends; 
 our ability to provide an assortment of high-quality, trend-right and everyday product offerings that generate new and repeat visits to our stores; 
 the customer experience we provide in our stores and online; 
 the level of traffic near our locations in the power, community and lifestyle centers in which we operate; 
 competition; 
 changes in our merchandise mix; 
 pricing; 
 our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; 
 the timing of promotional events and holidays; 
 the timing of introduction of new merchandise and customer acceptance of new merchandise; 
 our opening of new stores in the vicinity of existing stores; 
 the number of items purchased per store visit; 
 weather conditions; and 
 the impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including closures of our stores, adverse impacts on our operations, and consumer sentiment regarding discretionary spending. 
 Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. As we continue to pursue our growth strategy, we expect that a significant percentage of our net sales will continue to come from new stores not included in comparable sales. Accordingly, comparable sales are only one measure we use to assess the success of our growth strategy. 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
 Gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of goods sold. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of our net sales. Cost of goods sold reflects the direct costs of purchased merchandise and inbound freight and tariffs, as well as shipping and handling costs, store occupancy, distribution and buying expenses. Shipping and handling costs include internal fulfillment and shipping costs related to our e-commerce operations. Store occupancy costs include rent, common area maintenance, utilities and property taxes for all store locations. Distribution costs include costs for receiving, processing, warehousing and shipping of merchandise from our shipcenters and between store locations. Buying costs include compensation expense and other costs for our internal buying organization, including our merchandising and product development team and our planning and allocation group. These costs are significant and can be expected to continue to increase as our Company grows. 
 The components of our cost of goods sold may not be comparable to the components of cost of goods sold or similar measures of our competitors and other retailers. As a result, data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors and other retailers. 
 21 

The variable component of our cost of goods sold is higher in higher volume quarters because the variable component of our cost of goods sold generally increases as net sales increase. We regularly analyze the components of gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, as well as gross margin as it provides a useful and relevant measure to analyze our financial performance. Any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups, a significant increase in our use of markdowns, and a significant increase in inventory shrinkage or inability to generate sufficient sales leverage on the store occupancy, distribution and buying components of cost of goods sold could have an adverse impact on our gross profit and results of operations. In addition, global supply chain disruptions, the cost of freight and constraints on shipping capacity to transport inventory may have an adverse impact on our gross profit and results of operations, as well as our sales. Changes in the mix of our products may also impact our overall cost of goods sold. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (including Depreciation and Amortization) 
 Selling, general and administrative (including depreciation and amortization), or SG A, expenses are composed of payroll and other compensation, marketing and advertising expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other selling and administrative expenses. SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales are usually higher in lower sales volume quarters and lower in higher sales volume quarters. 
 The components of our SG A expenses may not be comparable to those of other retailers. We expect that our SG A expenses will increase in future periods due to our continuing store growth. In addition, any increase in future share-based grants, modifications or forfeitures will impact our share-based compensation expense included in SG A expenses. 
 Operating Income 
 Operating income equals gross profit less SG A expenses. Operating income excludes interest expense or income, other expense or income, and income tax expense or benefit. We use operating income as an indicator of the productivity of our business and our ability to manage SG A expenses. Operating income percentage measures operating income as a percentage of our net sales.

 Thirteen Weeks Ended November 2, 2024 Compared to the Thirteen Weeks Ended October 28, 2023 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales increased t o 843.7 million in t he thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 736.4 million in the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023, an increase of 107.3 million, or 14.6 . The increase was the result of a non-comparable sales increase of 103.4 million and a comparable sales increase of 3.9 million. The increase in non-comparable sales was primarily driven by new stores that opened in fiscal 2024 and the number of stores that opened in fiscal 2023 but have not been open for 15 full months. 
 Comparab le sales increased 0.6 . This increase resulted from an in crease of approximately 1.2 in the average dollar value of transactions, partially offset by a decrease of approximately 0.6 in the number of transactions. 
 23 

Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
 Cost of goods sold increased to 585.7 million in the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 513.6 million in the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023, an increase of 72.1 million, or 14.0 . The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of an increase in merchandise cost of goods sold resulting from an increase in net sales and included the impact of a non-recurring inventory write-off. Also contributing to the increase in costs of goods sold was an increase in store occupancy costs primarily resulting from new store openings. 
 Gross profit increased to 258.0 million in the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 222.8 million in the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023, an increase of 35.2 million , or 15.8 . Gross margin increased to 30.6 in th e thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 30.3 in the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023, an increase of approximately 30 basis points. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of a decrease as a percentage of net sales in distribution costs and merchandise cost of goods sold, which included lapping higher inventory shrinkage and the impact of a non-recurring inventory write-off. This decrease was partially offset by an increase as a percentage of net sales in store occupancy costs. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (including Depreciation and Amortization) 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) increased to 258.6 million in the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 206.7 million in the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023, an increase of 51.9 million, or 25.1 . As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) increased approximately 260 basis points to 30.7 in the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 28.1 in the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) was the result of an increase of 40.5 million in store-related ex penses primarily to support new store growth. Also contributing to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) was an increase of 11.4 million in corporate-related expenses, which included the impact of retention awards and cost-optimization initiatives. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense decreased to 0.5 million in the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 5.0 million in the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023, a decrease of 4.5 million or 89.6 . The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to the 17.4 million decrease in pre-tax income. 
 Our effective tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 was 23.4 compared to 25.4 in the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 was lower than the comparable prior year period primarily due to non-deductible expenses, partially offset by discrete items, which includes the impact of share-based accounting. 
 Net Income 
 As a result of the foregoing, net income decreas ed t o 1.7 million in th e thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 14.6 million in the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023, a decrease of 12.9 million or 88.4 . 
 Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended November 2, 2024 Compared to the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended October 28, 2023 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales increased t o 2,485.6 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 2,221.6 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, an increase of 264.0 million, or 11.9 . The increase was the resu lt of a non-comparable sales increase of 319.3 million, partially offset by a comparable sales decrease of 55.3 million. The increase in non-comparable sales was primarily driven by the number of stores that opened in fiscal 2023 but have not been open for 15 full months and new stores that opened in fiscal 2024. 
 Comparab le sales decreased 2.6 . This decrease resulted from a decrease of approximately 3.0 in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase of approximately 0.4 in the average dollar value of transactions . 
 Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
 Cost of goods sold increased to 1,692.3 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 1,499.4 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, an increase of 192.9 million, or 12.9 . The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of an increase in merchandise cost of goods sold resulting from an increase in net sales and included the impact of a non-recurring inventory write-off. Also contributing to the increase in costs of goods sold was an increase in store occupancy costs primarily resulting from new store openings. 
 24 

Gross profit increased to 793.3 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 722.2 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, an increase of 71.1 million , or 9.8 . Gross margin decreased to 31.9 in th e thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 32.5 in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, a decrease of approximately 60 basis points. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of an increase as a percentage of net sales in store occupancy costs, partially offset by a decrease as a percentage of net sales in distribution costs. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (including Depreciation and Amortization) 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) increased to 716.3 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 605.1 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, an increase of 111.2 million, or 18.4 . As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) increased approximately 160 basis points to 28.8 in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 27.2 in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) was the result of an increase of 98.9 million in store-related expenses primarily to support new store growth. Also contributing to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses (including depreciation and amortization) was an increase of 12.3 million in corporate-related expenses, which included the impact of retention awards, a non-recurring expense related to a settlement of employment-related litigation and cost-optimization initiatives. The increase in corporate-related expenses was partially offset by the impact of a non-recurring stock compensation benefit and lower incentive compensation expenses. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense decreased to 21.8 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 29.6 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, a decrease of 7.8 million or 26.6 . The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to the 40.6 million decrease in pre-tax income and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by discrete items, which includes the impact of share-based accounting. 
 Our effective tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 was 24.7 compared to 23.1 in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 was higher than the comparable prior year period primarily due to discrete items, which includes the impact of share-based accounting, partially offset by non-deductible expenses. 
 Net Income 
 As a result of the foregoing, net income decreased to 66.2 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 from 98.9 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, a decrease of 32.7 million or 33.1 . 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 Cash capital expenditures typically vary depending on the timing of new store openings and infrastructure-related investments. We plan to make cash capital expenditures of approximately 340 million in fiscal 2024, which exclude the impact of tenant allowances, and which we expect to fund from cash generated from operations, cash on hand, investments and, as needed, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to incur approximately 170 million of our cash capital expenditure budget in fiscal 2024 to construct and open approximately 227 net new stores, with the remainder projected to be spent on our store relocations and remodels, our shipcenters, which includes the expansion of two shipcenters, and our corporate infrastructure. 
 Our primary working capital requirements are for the purchase of store inventory and payment of payroll, rent, other store operating costs and distribution costs. Our working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, rising in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as we take title to increasing quantities of inventory in anticipation of our peak, year-end holiday shopping season in the fourth fiscal quarter. Fluctuations in working capital are also driven by the timing of new store openings. 
 Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the fiscal year with cash on-hand, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, which expires in September 2027, as needed, and we expect that funding to continue. When we have used our Revolving Credit Facility, the amount of indebtedness outstanding under it has tended to be the highest in the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. To the extent that we have drawn on the facility, we have paid down the borrowings before the end of the fiscal year with cash generated during our peak selling season in the fourth quarter. As of November 2, 2024, we did not have any direct borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and had approximately 225 million available on the line of credit. 
 25 

On June 14, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to 100 million of our common stock through June 30, 2025. In fiscal 2023, we repurchased 504,369 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 80.0 million, or average price of 158.63 per share. This program was retired on November 27, 2023. 
 On November 27, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to 100 million of our common stock through November 27, 2026. During the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, we repurchased 266,997 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 40.0 million, or average price of 149.79 per share. 
 Since approval of the share repurchase program in March 2018, we have purchased approximately 1.9 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately 270 million. There can be no assurances that any additional repurchases will be completed, or as to the timing or amount of any repurchases. The share repurchase program may be modified or discontinued at any time. 
 Based on our growth plans, we believe that our cash position, which includes our cash equivalents and short-term investments, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, which expires in September 2027, will be adequate to finance our planned capital expenditures, authorized share repurchases and working capital requirements over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. If cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are not sufficient or available to meet our requirements, then we will be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future. There can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or, if available, that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then-current shareholders. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities is presented in the following table (in millions): 
 Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 67.1 91.9 Net cash used in investing activities (30.7) (165.1) Net cash used in financing activities (46.5) (96.2) Net decrease during period in cash and cash equivalents (1) 
 (10.0) (169.4) 
 (1) Components may not add to total due to rounding. 

Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 was 67.1 million, a decrease of 24.8 million compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to increases in income taxes paid, a decrease in operating cash flows from store performance and changes in working capital. 
 
 Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 was 30.7 million, a decrease of 134.4 million compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in net sales, maturities, and redemptions of investment securities, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures. 
 
 Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 was 46.5 million, a decrease of 49.7 million compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in the repurchase and retirement of common stock and in common shares withheld for taxes. 
 
 Line of Credit

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the Annual Report. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as disclosed in the Annual Report, other than those which occur in the ordinary course of business. 
 From February 4, 2024 to November 2, 2024, we have entered into 152 new fully executed retail leases with average terms of approximately 10 years and other lease modifications that have future minimum lease payments of approximately 239.9 million. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, we were not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, net sales, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 See "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in "Part I. Financial Information, Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q, for a detailed description of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our principal market risk relates to interest rate sensitivity, which is the risk that future changes in interest rates will reduce our net income or net assets. We have investment securities that are interest-bearing securities and if there are changes in interest rates, those changes would affect the interest income we earn on these investments and, therefore, impact our cash flows and results of operations. However, due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe an immediate 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio, and accordingly we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates. 
 We also have a Revolving Credit Facility which includes a revolving line of credit, which bears interest at a variable rate. Because our Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, which could materially impact our consolidated statements of operations should we have any material borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 As of November 2, 2024, we had approximately 225 million available on the line of credit. The Credit Agreement provides that the interest rate payable on borrowings shall be, at the Company s option, a per annum rate equal to (a) a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.125 to 0.50 or (b) SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.12 to 1.50 . Letter of credit fees range from 1.125 to 1.50 . We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes, but this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our historical results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial. We seek to minimize the impact of increasing prices and general inflation in a variety of ways, including, with respect to our merchandise, by sourcing from different vendors and changing our product mix. However, we cannot assure that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future. 
 27 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. While our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, and employment actions, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of actions brought against us. Accordingly, adverse developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and negatively impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement or resolution. If a potential loss arising from these lawsuits, claims and pending actions is probable and reasonably estimable, we record the estimated liability based on circumstances and assumptions existing at the time. Although the outcome of these and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 On August 1, 2024, a putative class action was filed against Five Below, Inc. and a certain former senior officer in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, purportedly on behalf of a class of our investors who purchased or otherwise acquired our publicly traded securities between March 20, 2024 and July 16, 2024. On September 16, 2024, a similar action was commenced against Five Below, Inc. in the same court on behalf of a class of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired our publicly traded securities between December 1, 2022 and July 16, 2024. The complaints allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder in connection with various public statements made by us. On October 28, 2024, the court entered an order consolidating the actions and appointing the lead plaintiff. The deadline for lead plaintiff to file its Consolidated Amended Complaint is January 13, 2025. Defendants' response thereto, including any motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint, is due sixty (60) days from the filing of the Consolidated Amended Complaint. We intend to vigorously defend against these actions, which we believe to be without merit. The potential impact of these actions, which seek unspecified damages, attorneys fees and expenses, is uncertain. 
 29 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Risk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected.
