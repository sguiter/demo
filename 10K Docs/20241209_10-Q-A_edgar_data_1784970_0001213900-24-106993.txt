NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(UNAUDITED) 

. We currently pursue two corporate strategies. One business strategy is to continue providing software development services, and the other strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin. 

Software development 

We provide AI-enabled software development
services to our customers, which include developing, designing, and implementing various SAAS software solutions for businesses of all
types, including industrial and other businesses. 

Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy 

Our bitcoin acquisition strategy generally involves
acquiring bitcoin with our liquid assets that exceed working capital requirements, and from time to time, subject to market conditions,
issuing debt or equity securities or engaging in other capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase
bitcoin. 

We view our bitcoin holdings as long-term
holdings and expect to continue to accumulate bitcoin. We have not set any specific target for the amount of bitcoin we seek to hold,
and we will continue to monitor market conditions in determining whether to engage in additional financing to purchase additional bitcoin. 

This overall strategy also contemplates that we
may (i) periodically sell bitcoin for general corporate purposes, including to generate cash for treasury management or in connection
with strategies that generate tax benefits in accordance with applicable law, (ii) enter into additional capital raising transactions
that are collateralized by our bitcoin holdings, and (iii) consider pursuing additional strategies to create income streams or otherwise
generate funds using our bitcoin holdings. 

We believe that, due to its limited supply, bitcoin
offers the opportunity for appreciation in value if its adoption increases and has the potential to serve as a hedge against inflation
in the long-term.

Purchase of BTC 

Fair value gain from digital assets 

Ending balance 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company held approximately 833 BTC at
the total cost of . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized
fair value gain of and on digital assets respectively. 

Amended and Restated BTC Trading Contract 

On September 24, 2024, the Company and the
Association Seller entered into an Amended and Restated BTC Trading Contract (the Amended BTC Contract ), which amended
and restated the BTC Contract. Under the Amended BTC Contract, the Company is entitled to purchase up to 5,167 BTC (the Total
BTC from the BTC sellers set forth on Schedule I to the Amended BTC Contract (the Schedule I BTC Sellers through
the Association Seller at a purchase price of US per BTC (subject to an additional purchase price by issuance of warrants to purchase
shares of Common Stock at a nominal exercise price as described below) over a 12-month period commencing on the date of the Amended BTC
Contract. The purchase price for the Total BTC will be paid by the Company in cash or shares of Common Stock. Although the Amended BTC
Contract states that the Association Seller (Party B) owns the virtual currency , to our knowledge, this statement was mistakenly
made. As of the date of the Amended BTC Contract, it were the Schedule I BTC Sellers who are the individual members of the Association
Seller, not the Association Seller itself, who own the BTC to be sold under the Amended BTC Contract. 

To our knowledge, the Association Seller entered
into a cooperation agreement with each Schedule I BTC Sellers (the Cooperation Agreement on the same day when the Amended
BTC Contract was entered. Under the Cooperation Agreement, each Schedule I BTC Seller agrees to transfer a specified number of BTC (as
set forth in the Cooperation Agreement) to a BTC wallet address designated by the Association Seller for the transactions contemplated
under the Amended BTC Contract. 

11 

and the Company will pay the remaining balance
through (i) the issuance of shares of Common Stock (the Shares valued at per share and (ii) the issuance
of warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock at a nominal exercise price (the Warrants ). 

The value of per share for the Shares
is equal to the sum of (i) the Nasdaq Official Closing Price (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) immediately preceding the signing of the Amended
BTC Contract, and (ii) . Using the same per value valuation, the warrants are worth approximately . 

Pursuant to the Amended BTC Contract, the
Company shall exercise its option to purchase BTC thereunder prior to September 24, 2025. While the Company s purchase option thereunder
is time-limited, the Amended BTC Contract itself will remain in effect without a defined expiration date, unless otherwise terminated.
In the event of a breach by either party, the non-breaching party has the right to terminate the agreement. In such case, the breaching
party will be obligated to pay a penalty of to the non-breaching party. 

The
above description of the Amended BTC Contract does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the Amended BTC Contract, a copy of which is attached to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1, filed
with the SEC on September 27, 2024, which is incorporated by reference
herein. 

Impact on Company s Capitalization and
Stockholder Approval 

The issuance of securities pursuant to the Amended
BTC Contract will not affect the rights of the Company s existing stockholders, but such issuances will have a significant dilutive
effect on the Company s existing stockholders, including the voting power of the existing stockholders. 

As of the date of this report, there were issued and outstanding
shares of the Common Stock . Immediately after the issuance of the Shares (assuming no exercise of
the Warrants), there will be issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock, and the ownership percentage of the Company s
existing stockholders in the Company will be diluted to approximately . Assuming full exercise of the Warrants concurrently with
the issuance of the Shares, immediately after the issuance of the Shares, there will be issued and outstanding shares of Common
Stock, and the ownership percentage of the Company s existing stockholders in the Company will be further diluted to approximately
 . 

Pursuant to Nasdaq Rule
5635(a), if an issuer intends to issue common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, in connection with
the acquisition of stock or assets of another company, which may equal or exceed of the outstanding common stock or voting power on
a pre-transaction basis, the issuer generally must obtain the prior approval of its stockholders. Pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5635(d), if
an issuer intends to issue common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, other than in a public offering,
which may equal or exceed of the outstanding common stock or voting power on a pre-transaction basis for a price that is lower than
(i) the Nasdaq Official Closing Price (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) immediately preceding the signing of a binding agreement; or (ii) the
average Nasdaq Official Closing Price of the common stock (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) for the five trading days immediately preceding
the signing of the binding agreement for such common stock, the issuer generally must obtain the prior approval of its stockholders. 

The Shares to be issued to the Schedule I
BTC Sellers in the Amended 5,000 BTC Transaction exceeds the threshold for which stockholder approval is required under Nasdaq Rule 5635(a),
and the Warrant Shares to be issued to the Schedule I BTC Sellers upon the full exercise of the Warrants could result in the issuance
of a number of shares exceeding the threshold and pricing for which stockholder approval is required under Nasdaq 5635(d). As such, the
Company is required to obtain requisite stockholder approval for the Amended BTC Transaction. 

As disclosed in a Preliminary
Information Statement on Schedule 14C filed by the Company on October 3, 2024, the Company has obtained the requisite stockholder approval
for the Amended BTC Transaction in accordance with the Company s articles of incorporation and bylaws on September 24, 2024. 

12 

The Company does not require collateral for accounts
receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable due to estimated credit losses. The Company records
the allowance against bad debt expense through the condensed consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative
expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when
the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. There is no allowance for expected credit loss as the accounts receivable
has been received as at reporting date. 

As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filed
on September 28, 2023, the Company entered into a BTC Trading Contract (the BTC Contract with an autonomous organization
(the Association Seller ), which supports its members in the sale of BTC. While the Association Seller provides services
to facilitate the sale of BTC by its members, it does not exert control over them by ownership or contract, nor does it make decisions
for its members relating to the sale of BTC. None of the members of the Association Seller hold equity, serve as director or officer,
or otherwise have voting power or management rights of the Association Seller. 

Under the BTC Contract, the Company has the
right to purchase up to BTC from the members of the Association Seller (each, a BTC Seller through the Association
Seller at a locked price of /BTC over a 12-month period commencing on September 25, 2023, with payment to be made in the form
of cash or the Company s shares. Although the BTC Contract states that the Association Seller (Party B) owns the virtual
currency , to our knowledge, this statement was mistakenly made. As of the date of the BTC Contract, it were the individual members
of the Association Seller, not the Association Seller itself, who own the BTC to be sold under the BTC Contract. We believe the Association
Seller will coordinate with its members to fulfill the Company s purchase of BTC, however, we cannot guarantee that the Company
will be able to purchase BTC from the BTC Sellers. The BTC Contract was entered into solely between the Company and the Association Seller
and no BTC Sellers owe any legal obligation to the Company in connection with the purchase and sale of BTC. 

Following the execution of the BTC Contract, the
Company purchased BTC from the BTC Sellers and decided to purchase an additional BTC (the 1,000 BTC Purchase ).
As of December 31, 2023, the Company made a prepayment to the BTC Sellers through the Association Seller of approximately 
(the Prepayment Amount ), representing of the total purchase price for BTC. 

According to the Amendment Agreement, the Company
agreed to pay the aggregate price for the BTC through the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock (the
 Common Stock valued at per share, which was the closing market price of the Common Stock as of May 1, 2024 (the Then
FMV and warrants to purchase shares of the Common Stock with the exercise price of per share (equal to of
the Then FMV). In connection with the 5,000 BTC Purchase, on May 8, 2024, the Company filed a Preliminary Information Statement on Schedule
14C (the Preliminary 14C ). Subsequently, the Company decided to cease pursuing the 5,000 BTC Purchase due to the market
fluctuations in BTC and further discussions with the BTC Sellers, which was previously disclosed on a Form 8-K filed by the Company on
June 26, 2024.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in
this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors discussed elsewhere in this report. 

Business 

Next Technology Holdings Inc (formerly known as
 WeTrade Group, Inc was incorporated in the State of Wyoming on March 28, 2019. We currently pursue two corporate strategies.
One business strategy is to continue providing software development services, and the other strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin. 

Software development 

We provide AI-enabled software development
services to our customers, which include developing, designing, and implementing various SAAS software solutions for businesses of all
types, including industrial and other businesses. 

Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy 

Our bitcoin acquisition strategy generally involves
acquiring bitcoin with our liquid assets that exceed working capital requirements, and from time to time, subject to market conditions,
issuing debt or equity securities or engaging in other capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase
bitcoin. 

We view our bitcoin holdings as long-term
holdings and expect to continue to accumulate bitcoin. We have not set any specific target for the amount of bitcoin we seek to hold,
and we will continue to monitor market conditions in determining whether to engage in additional financing to purchase additional bitcoin. 

This overall strategy also contemplates that we
may (i) periodically sell bitcoin for general corporate purposes, including to generate cash for treasury management or in connection
with strategies that generate tax benefits in accordance with applicable law, (ii) enter into additional capital raising transactions
that are collateralized by our bitcoin holdings, and (iii) consider pursuing additional strategies to create income streams or otherwise
generate funds using our bitcoin holdings. 

We believe that, due to its limited supply, bitcoin
offers the opportunity for appreciation in value if its adoption increases and has the potential to serve as a hedge against inflation
in the long-term.

Revenue from Operations 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total revenue were nil and 1,500,000 respectively.
The decrease is mainly due to decrease in AI SAAS revenue during the period. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

For the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 1,242,128 and 537,576 respectively. The increase is mainly due to
an increase in BTC consulting fee and legal fees during the period. 

Other Income/ (expenses)

from digital assets during the period as compared to the provision for bad debts of 11,347,054 in prior period.

As a result of the factors described above, there
was a net profit of 13,991,362 and net loss of 13,714,836 for the period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase

the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total revenue was nil and 1,500,000 respectively. The decrease is mainly
due to decrease in AI SAAS system revenue during the period. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

For the three-month period ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 566,983 and 234,800 respectively. The increase is mainly due to an increase
in BTC consulting fee and legal fees during the period. 

Other income/ (expenses) 

The other income of 2,303,789 is mainly due to
loss from digital assets during the period. The other expenses of 14,406,397 were mainly for fair value loss of digital assets of 3.05
million and provision for bad debts of 11.3 million in prior reporting period. 

Net loss 

As a result of the factors described above, there
was a net profit of 1,372,076 and net loss of 13,412,061 for the period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase
in net profit is mainly due to loss from digital assets and no provision for bad debts were incurred during the period. 

19 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand of 668,387. There is
no change in cash held during the period. 

Operating activities 

As of September
30, 2024, our cash flow used in operating activities is 81,332 for the period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the net cash flow
from operating activities of 11,886,808 in prior period.
The decrease was mainly due to the turnaround of the net profit of 13.9 million from the net losses of 13.7 million in prior reporting
period. 

Investing activities 

Cash provided used in investing activities was nil for the period
ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cash used in investing activities of 37,115,500 in prior period. The decrease is mainly due to
no digital assets being purchased during the period. 

Financing activities 

Cash provided by our financing activities was 81,332 for the period
ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of 17,203,894. The decrease is mainly due to lesser in
shareholders advance and no issuance of stock during the period as compared to the prior period. 

Inflation 

Inflation does not materially affect our business
or the results of our operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

We prepare our financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP ). GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting
and disclosure rules and requirements. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results could differ from those
estimates. We use historical data to assist in the forecast of our future results. Deviations from our projections are addressed when
our financials are reviewed on a monthly basis. This allows us to be proactive in our approach to managing our business. It also allows
us to rely on proven data rather than having to make assumptions regarding our estimates. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

We have reviewed all the recently issued, but
not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company
financial statements. 

20 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company 
as defined by Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, and as such are not required to provide the information contained in this item pursuant
to Item 305 of Regulation S-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

The management of the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

With respect to the period ended September 30,
2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. 

Based upon our evaluation regarding the period
ended September 30, 2024, the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer, has concluded that its disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple
levels of transaction review. Material weaknesses noted are lack of an audit committee, lack of a majority of outside directors on the
board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
and management is dominated by two individuals, without adequate compensating controls. However, management believes the financial statements
and other information presented herewith are materially correct. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
- Guidance for Smaller Public Companies (the COSO criteria). Based on our assessment, management identified material weaknesses related
to: (i) our internal audit functions; (ii) a lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions; and the lack of multiple levels
of review of our accounting data. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of September 30, 2024, we did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with any
policies and procedures may deteriorate. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible
and may not be economically feasible. To the extent possible, we will implement procedures to assure that the initiation of transactions,
the custody of assets and the recording of transactions will be performed by separate individuals. With proper funding we plan on remediating
the significant deficiencies identified above, and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these steps and make any changes that
our management deems appropriate. 

A material weakness is a control deficiency (within
the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 5) or combination of control deficiencies, that results
in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Wyoming Shareholder Lawsuits: Since mid-September
2023, Mr. Zheng Dai, Mr. Pijun Liu, and certain individuals under their control (the Unauthorized Persons had been falsely
and repeatedly holding themselves out as representing and/or authorized to represent the Company. For example, the Unauthorized Persons
caused to be filed certain current reports on Forms 8-K dated September 28, 2023 and October 10, 2023, in which they purported to appoint
new officers and directors. These filings were false and should be disregarded. 

On September 28, 2023, a derivative lawsuit was
filed by certain purported shareholders affiliated with the Unauthorized Persons in the United States District Court for the District
of Wyoming against certain officers and directors of the Company, seeking control of the Company. This case was dismissed without prejudice
on October 18, 2023. 

On October 18, 2023, the same individuals
who filed the above-described derivative suit filed a direct action against the Company in the Chancery Court of the State of
Wyoming (the Chancery Court ), again seeking control of the Company. The Company responded to the lawsuit, sought a
temporary restraining order restraining the plaintiff-shareholders and their affiliates (including the Unauthorized Persons) from
claiming to be in control of the Company. 

In early 2024, the Court issued an order restraining
the Unauthorized Persons from purporting to control the Company. The Unauthorized Persons lawsuit was subsequently dismissed with
prejudice, meaning they can no longer attempt to assert control over the Company. 

New York Loan Guarantee Litigation: In
May 2024, certain non-U.S. Parties believed to be affiliated with the Unauthorized Persons described above filed a lawsuit in New
York State court against many non-U.S. borrowers, alleging the borrowers have not paid certain loans. These lender-plaintiffs also
sued the Company under alleged guarantees it allegedly signed to guarantee the loans at issue. The Company does not believe these
guarantees were legitimate, nor that New York is the proper place for it. The Company has moved to dismiss. 

Books and records litigation: In September
2024, the Unauthorized Persons filed a lawsuit in Wyoming State court for books and records. The Company does not believe the lawsuit
has merit under Wyoming s books and records statute and is defending this suit. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

We are a smaller reporting company 
as defined by Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, and as such are not required to provide the information contained in this item. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

None. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 

Capitalization 

On June 9, 2023, the Wyoming Secretary of State
approved the Company s certificate of amendment to amend its Articles of Incorporation to effect 1 for 185 Reverse Stock Split.
The total issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock decreased from 195,057,503 to 1,054,364 shares, with the par
value unchanged at zero. 

The Reverse Stock Split is intended to more expediently
enable the Company to regain compliance to achieve a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share for continued listing on Nasdaq, as set forth
in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Requirement ). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every one-for-one
hundred and eighty-five (185) shares of the Company s Common Stock then issued and outstanding will automatically, and without any
action of the Company or any holder thereof, be combined, converted, and changed into one (1) validly issued and non-assessable share
of Common Stock. fractional shares will be issued to any shareholder, and in lieu of issuing any such fractional shares, the fractional
shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the nearest whole share of Common Stock. 

In September 2023, there were 1,570,600 shares
issued with the total amount of 12,616,454, and the Company s common stock issued has been increased to 2,625,130 shares as of
December 31, 2023. In April 2024, there are 4,351,280 shares issued with the total amount of 14,776,000 for the acquisition of 20 of
associate company and loan conversion to equity, the Company s common stock issued has been increased to 6,976,410 shares as of
September 30, 2024. 

Bitcoin Option Contract 

On May 2, 2024, the Company entered into a
Bitcoin Option Contract (the Option Contract with the Association Seller. Under the Option Contract, the Association Seller
agrees to sell, and the Company has the option to purchase, up to 20,000 BTC at a fixed price of US 60,000 per BTC over a three-year
period commencing on May 2, 2024. The Company can exercise this option at any time during the three-year period, either in one or multiple
transactions, as mutually agreed upon by both parties. Payments for the BTC can be made in cash or in the Company s common stock,
at the Company s discretion. In addition, the Option Contract allows for an optional 10 advance payment in cash if agreed upon
by both parties. Although the Option Contract states that the Association Seller (Party B) owns the virtual currency , to
our knowledge, this statement was mistakenly made. As of the date of the Option Contract, it were the individual members of the Association
Seller, not the Association Seller itself, who own the BTC to be sold under the Option Contract. 

As of the date of this report, the Company has
not paid any advance payment, nor exercised its option to purchase any BTC under the BTC Option Contract. Further, the Company does not
intend to exercise its option to purchase any BTC under the BTC Option Contract. 

The above description of the Option Contract does
not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Option Contract, a copy of which is
attached to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2, filed with the SEC on May 6, 2024, which is incorporated by
reference herein.
