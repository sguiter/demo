shares shares before the Reverse Split (as defined below)) of a newly designated Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock, par value per share (the Series C Preferred Stock ), with each Series C Preferred Stock initially
being convertible into shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share, subject to certain adjustments and
limitations (the Share Exchange ). The Share Exchange closed on October 21, 2020. 

As a result of the consummation of the Share Exchange,
the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of QDM BVI and its subsidiaries, QDM Group Limited, a Hong Kong corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of QDM BVI QDM HK and YeeTah. 

The Company was a shell company prior to the reverse
acquisition which occurred as a result of the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, and QDM BVI
was a private operating company. The reverse acquisition by a non-operating public shell company of a private operating company typically
results in the owners and management of the private company having actual or effective voting and operating control of the combined company.
Therefore, the reverse acquisition is considered a capital transaction in substance. In other words, the transaction is a reverse recapitalization,
equivalent to the issuance of stock by the private company for the net monetary assets of the shell company accompanied by a recapitalization.
Therefore, the Share Exchange was accounted for as a recapitalization and QDM BVI is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial
reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of QDM BVI have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized.

on February 6, 2020 in Cyprus. The Company acquired QDMS through an intermediary holding company, Lutter Global Limited LGL ),
which was incorporated on July 29, 2021 in the BVI. Before the acquisition, Huihe Zheng was the sole shareholder of QDMS. As part of the
acquisition, Mr. Zheng sold all the shares of QDMS to LGL for a consideration of EUR in November 2021 and at the same time the sole
shareholder of LGL, Mengting Xu, transferred all her shares in LGL to the Company for a consideration of US . As a result, the Company
acquired a ownership of LGL, which, in turn, owned of QDMS. Accordingly, the acquisition was treated as a corporate restructuring
(reorganization) of entities under common control and thus the current capital structures of QDMS and LGL were retrospectively presented
in prior periods as if such structures existed at that time and in accordance with ASC 805-50-45-5. On October 4, 2023, the Company sold
QDMS to Mr. Zheng for no consideration. As a result of the disposition, the Company recognized a gain of .

of shares of its common stock at a price of per share to certain investors, generating gross proceeds to the
Company of . 

On March 28, 2024, the Company filed an Articles
of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the Amendment with the Florida Department of State to (i) increase
its authorized shares of common stock, par value per share, from shares to shares and its authorized shares
of preferred stock, par value per share, from shares to shares; and (ii) effect a forward split of its issued
and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 10-for-1 (the 2024 Forward Stock Split ), which became effective as
of April 5, 2024. The foregoing amendments were approved by the Company s board of directors (the Board and shareholders
holding approximately of the voting power of the Company. 

As a result of the 2024 Forward Stock Split, each
issued and outstanding share of the Company s common stock prior to the effective time of the 2024 Forward Stock Spilt were split
into shares of common stock and the total number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock increased from shares
to shares. The 2024 Forward Stock Split has no impact on the Company s issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock
other than that the conversion rate and voting rights of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock were proportionately adjusted. 

On April 4, 2024, the 2024 Forward Stock Split
was approved and announced by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority with an effective date on April 5, 2024.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion
and analysis is based on, and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere
in this Report. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in the below discussion and elsewhere in this report have the meanings
ascribed to them in the footnotes to the accompanying financial statements included as part of this report. 

Overview 

From 2016 to 2020, we
were a telemedicine company that provides Connect-a-Doc telemedicine kits to schools. Our services aimed to provide alternatives to schools
that desire to provide a higher level of healthcare to their students but are unable to keep a full-time school nurse available. In 2020,
this business was discontinued and we became a non-operating shell company until our acquisition of YeeTah, as more fully
described below. 

On October 21, 2020,
we entered into the Share Exchange Agreement with QDM BVI, and Huihe Zheng, the sole shareholder of QDM BVI, who is also our principal
shareholder and serves as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of QDM BVI
in exchange for the issuance to Mr. Zheng 900,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, with each share of Series C Preferred Stock initially
being convertible into 11 shares of our common stock, subject to certain adjustments and limitations. The Share Exchange closed on October
21, 2020. 

As a result of the consummation of the Share Exchange,
we acquired QDM BVI and its indirect subsidiary, YeeTah, an insurance brokerage company and assumed the business operations of QDM BVI
and its subsidiaries. YeeTah is primarily engaged in marketing and sales of diversified insurance products, including property, life and
social security insurance products, underwritten by insurance companies operating in Hong Kong to individual customers from Hong Kong
SAR and Mainland China. In addition, as an MPF Intermediary, YeeTah is also licensed to provide its customers with assistance on account
opening and related services under the MPF and the ORSO in Hong Kong, both of which are retirement protection schemes set up for employees. 

Recent Developments 

On October 4, 2024, we filed an Articles of Amendment to Articles of
Incorporation of the Company with the Florida Division of Corporation to increase our authorized shares of Series B preferred stock, par
value 0.0001 per share (the Series B Shares ), from 2,000,000 shares to 10,000,000 shares, which became effective as of
October 7, 2024. The foregoing amendment was approved by the Board, in accordance with our Articles of Incorporation and the Florida Business
Corporation Act. 

On October 9, 2024, we entered into a securities
subscription agreement (the Securities Subscription Agreement with Huihe Zheng, our Chief Executive Officer, President,
and Chairman of the Board. Pursuant to the Securities Subscription Agreement, we issued 6,000,000 Series B Shares to Mr. Zheng at a purchase
price of 0.10 per share, in exchange for the cancellation by Mr. Zheng of a portion of the currently outstanding principal amount of
the debt owed by us to Mr. Zheng, in the amount of US 600,000, which was loaned by Mr. Zheng to us providing for our working capital and
general corporate expenses. As a result of the issuance of Series B Shares to Mr. Zheng, Mr. Zheng beneficially owns 81.0 of the aggregate
voting power of us as of the date of this Report.

Revenue 

Revenue decreased by approximately 143,000, or 12.3 , for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in revenue from our
top insurance company partner. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, a substantial portion of the revenue from this partner was
derived from insurance renewal commissions, which are based on renewal commission rate that is lower than the first-year commission rate. During the same period, we increased
our cooperation with other insurance company partners, who offered higher basic commission rates. The shift in focus on different partnership
also contributed to the overall decrease in revenue from our top insurance company partner. 

Cost of sales 

Cost
of sales decreased by approximately 559,000, or 78.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to
the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower referral fees paid. On May 22, 2024, the Hong Kong Insurance Authority
issued a circular, which mandated, among other things, that referral fees for introducing clients should not be excessively high and should
be consistent with the work the referrers provide. In compliance with this regulatory directive, and after discussion with our referrers,
we lowered our referral fee rates, which resulted in the significant decrease in cost of sales. 

Gross profit 

Gross profit margin increased by approximately
46.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023, which was in line with the significant decrease
in cost of sales. 

16 

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses generally
are fixed and consist primarily of employee salaries, office rent, insurance costs, general office operating expenses (e.g., utilities,
repairs and maintenance) and professional fees in engaging various service providers. 

General and administrative expenses increased
by approximately 150,000, or 120.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The change
is primarily due to hiring of more employees and increase in professional fees paid to various service providers. 

Other income 

Other income increased by approximately 14,000,
or 626.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The income was mainly attributable to
the receipt of referral fees from a trust company for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and bank interest income for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in referral fee was due to a one-off referral fee from a trust company in July 2024. 

Current income tax expenses 

Current income tax expenses increased by approximately
 60,000, or 100.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The change is primarily
due to increase in profits in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net income 

As a result of the factors described above, net
income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 220,000, or 81.9 , as compared to the same period of
2023. 

Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

Revenue 

Revenue decreased by approximately 2.4
million, or 54.9 , for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease was mainly due
to the decrease in revenue from our top insurance company partner. In the six months ended September 30, 2024, a substantial portion
of the revenue from this partner was derived from insurance renewal commissions, which are based on the renewal commission rate that
is lower than the first-year commission rate. During the same period, we increased our cooperation with other insurance company partners,
who offered higher basic commission rates. The shift in focus on different partnership also contributed to the overall decrease in
revenue from our top insurance company partner. Moreover, following the lift by Hong Kong government of the COVID-19 travel
restrictions and quarantine requirements in January 2023, we experienced a rebound in business as cross-border travel resumes with
mainland China after three years of restrictions. As a result, our revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was
significantly higher than the other periods. Our revenue subsequently stabilized and maintained at a level of approximately 1.1
million to 0.9 million per quarter for subsequent quarters. 

17 

Cost of sales 

Cost of sales decreased by approximately 2.4
million, or 87.4 , for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily
due to lower referral fees paid as a result of adjustment of our referral fee rates according to regulatory directive from Hong Kong Insurance
Authority.. 

Gross profit 

Gross profit margin for the six months ended September
30, 2024 increased by approximately 44.8 as compared to the same period of 2023, which was in line with the significant decrease in cost
of sales. 

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses generally
are fixed and consist primarily of employee salaries, office rent, insurance costs, general office operating expenses (e.g., utilities,
repairs and maintenance) and professional fees paid to various service providers. 

General and administrative expenses increased
by approximately 244,000, or 87.6 , for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The increase
is primarily due to hiring of more employees, and increase in professional fees paid various service providers. 

Other income 

Other income decreased by approximately 8,000, or 23.3 , for the six
months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The income was mainly attributable to the receipt of referral
fees by introducing clients to other companies. The decrease in referral fee was due to a much lower referral commission rate for renewal
premiums in 2024, while partially offset by a one-off referral fee paid by a trust company in July 2024. 

Current income tax expenses 

Current income tax expenses decreased by approximately
 14,000, or 6.4 , for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The change is primarily
due to decrease in profits in the six months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net income 

As a result of the factors described above, net
income for the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 263,000, or 21.7 , as compared to the same period of 2023. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

The Company s reporting currency is the
United States dollar US ). The Company s operations are principally conducted in Hong Kong where the Hong Kong dollar
is the functional currency. The functional currency of LGL is the Euro. 

Transactions denominated in other than the functional
currencies are re-measured into the functional currency of the entity at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currencies are translated into the functional currency
at the prevailing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange differences are reported in the statements of operations
and comprehensive loss. 

The exchanges rate used
for translation from Hong Kong dollar to US was 7.8000, a pegged rate determined by the linked exchange rate system in Hong Kong. This
pegged rate was used to translate Company s balance sheets, income statement items and cash flow items for both the three and six
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the year ended March 31, 2024. 

18 

The exchanges rates used for translation from
Euro to US are as follows: 

October 4, 2023 
 September 30, 2023 
 
 Period-end spot rate 
 EUR 1 = US 1.0518 
 EUR 1 = US 1.0584 
 
 Average rate for the year 
 EUR 1 = US 1.0877 
 EUR 1 = US 1.0886 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our working capital requirements mainly comprise
of commissions paid to technical representatives and referral fees, operating lease payments and employee salaries. We have financed our
operations primarily through cash generated by operating activities, equity financings and advances from our principal shareholder. QDM
is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through YeeTah, which is its only entity that has operating cash
inflows. Our expenses are paid directly either by YeeTah or our principal shareholder. 

YeeTah is a licensed insurance broker
company in Hong Kong and subject to certain Hong Kong insurance broker requirements regarding its share capital and net assets.
According to the requirements, a licensed insurance broker company must at all times maintain a paid-up share capital of not less
than USD64,103 (HK 500,000) and net assets of not less than USD64,103 (HK 500,000), subject to the phase-in transitional arrangement
applicable to specified insurance broker companies, including YeeTah, pursuant to which, YeeTah is required to maintain the amount
of paid-up share capital and net assets of (i) not less than USD12,821 (HK 100,000) for the period from September 23, 2019 to
December 31, 2021 and (ii) not less than USD38,462 (HK 300,000) for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023. YeeTah was
in compliance with the applicable minimum paid-up share capital and net assets requirements as of September 30, 2024. 

There have been no cash and any asset transactions
between us and our subsidiaries since the Share Exchange. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had 6,298,869 and 5,158,223,
respectively, in cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consisted of cash deposited in banks.

Operating Activities: 

Net cash generated from operating activities was
approximately 1.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash generated from operating activities of approximately
 2.7 million for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of approximately 1.7 million in the net cash inflow in operating activities.
The decrease in net cash inflow in operating activities was primarily due to the decrease of net income of approximately 263,000 in the
six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 and the following major working capital changes: 

(1) 
 Change in accounts receivable resulted in an approximately 44,000 cash outflow for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an approximately 159,000 cash inflow for the same period of 2023, which led to an approximately 203,000 increase in net cash outflow in operating activities. 

(2) 
 Change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted in an approximately
 58,000 cash inflow for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an approximately 1.2 million cash inflow for the same period
of 2023, which led to an approximately 1.1 million decrease in net cash inflow from operating activities. 

(3) 
 Change in short-term and long-term prepaid expenses resulted in an
approximately 128,000 cash outflow for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an approximately 59,000 cash outflow for
the same period of 2023, which led to an approximately 69,000 increase in net cash outflow from operating activities. During this quarter,
the Company prepaid HKD 1,000,000 (US 128,205) to a new contracted referrer for future referral fees payable to the referrer. As of September
30, 2024, the outstanding prepaid balance was HKD 929,521 (US 119,169), and the management of the Company expected the prepaid amount
would be fully credited against the referral fees payable to the referrer by the end of March 31, 2025. 

(4) 
 Change in income tax payable resulted in an approximately 206,000 cash inflow for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an approximately 220,000 cash inflow for the same period of 2023, which led to an approximately 14,000 decrease in net cash inflow from operating activities. 

Investing Activities: 

Net cash used in investing
activities was nil for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of approximately 93,000
for the same period of 2023. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was solely attributable
to acquisitions of fixed assets. 

Financing Activities: 

For the six months ended
September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 92,000, which was derived from the proceeds borrowed
from related parties of approximately 129,000, partially offset by payment for offering cost of approximately 38,000. 

For the six months ended
September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 130,000, which was fully derived from the proceeds borrowed
from related parties. 

Material Commitments 

We have no material commitments
for the next twelve months.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
contingent assets and liabilities, each as of the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
On an ongoing basis, management evaluates their estimates and assumptions, and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the
financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. Management bases their estimates on historical experience
and on various other factors that they believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual outcomes could differ
materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

While our significant accounting policies are
more fully described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements,
we believe that there were no critical accounting policies and estimates that affect the preparation of financial statements. 

Off-balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not
have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that had or were reasonably likely to have any effect on their respective financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and
procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September
30, 2024 due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with
small staff: (i) lack of proper segregation of duties and risk assessment process; (ii) lack of formal documentation in internal controls
over financial reporting; and (iii) lack of independent directors and an audit committee. We have hired a qualified Chief Financial Officer
who has extensive experience and expertise in US GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. We will continue to devote resources to remediate
the aforementioned material weaknesses, as we grow and such resources required for implementing proper internal controls for financial
reporting are available. 

We do not expect that
our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and
procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures,
no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies
and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. 

Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

21 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

We are not currently a party to any material legal
or administrative proceedings. We may from time to time be subject to legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary
course of business. Litigation or any other legal or administrative proceeding, regardless of the outcome, is likely to result in substantial
cost and diversion of our resources, including our management s time and attention. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

As a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2
of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, as of the date of this Report, there have been
no material changes with respect to those risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on July
1, 2024. Any of the previously disclosed risk factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations
or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future
filings with the SEC. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

None. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 

Not applicable. 

Item 5. Information. 

Trading Arrangements

2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated any Rule
