WORLD GOLD TRUST SERVICES, LLC 

CLAWBACK POLICY 

Introduction 

World Gold Trust Services, LLC (the Company is the sponsor of SPDR Gold Trust (the Trust and, with the assistance of the trustee of the Trust, is responsible for preparing and filing periodic reports on behalf of the Trust with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including the Trust s quarterly and annual reports which include the Trust s financial statements. The Trust does not have officers, directors or employees, however, the officers and directors of the Company perform certain functions with respect to the Trust that, if the Trust had directors or officer, would typically be performed by them. 

The Board of Directors (the " Board ") of the Company believes that it is in the best interests of the Company, the Trust and the Trust s shareholders to create and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company's compensation philosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this policy which provides for the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement of the Trust resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws (the " Policy "). This Policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the " Exchange Act ") and Section 303A.14 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (the " Clawback Listing Standards "). 

Administration 

This Policy shall be administered by the Board. Any determinations made by the Board shall be final and binding on all affected individuals. 

Covered Executives 

This Policy applies to the Company's current and former executive officers, as determined by the Board in accordance with the definition in Section 10D of the Exchange Act and the Clawback Listing Standards (" Covered Executives "). 

Recoupment; Accounting Restatement 

In the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of the Trust s financial statements due to the Company's material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period, the Board will require reimbursement or forfeiture of any excess Incentive Compensation received by any Covered Executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement on behalf of the Trust. 

Incentive Compensation 

For purposes of this Policy, Incentive Compensation means any of the following; provided that, such compensation is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial reporting measure: 

Annual bonuses and other short- and long-term cash incentives. 

Stock options. 

Stock appreciation rights. 

Restricted stock. 

Restricted stock units. 

Performance shares. 

Performance units. 

Financial reporting measures include with respect to the Trust: 

Stock price. 

Total shareholder return. 

Net assets. 

Net income. 

Excess Incentive Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery 

The amount to be recovered will be the excess of the Incentive Compensation paid to the Covered Executive based on the erroneous data over the Incentive Compensation that would have been paid to the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated results, as determined by the Board, without regard to any taxes paid by the Covered Executive in respect of the Incentive Compensation paid based on the erroneous data. 

If the Board cannot determine the amount of excess Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the information in the accounting restatement, then it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement. 

Method of Recoupment 

The Board will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping Incentive Compensation hereunder which may include, without limitation: 

(a) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation previously paid; 

(b) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards; 

(c) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive; 

(d)) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or 

(e) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board. 

No Indemnification 

The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any incorrectly awarded Incentive Compensation. 

Interpretation 

The Board is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act, any applicable rules or standards adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Clawback Listing Standards. 

Effective Date 

This Policy shall be effective as of the date it is adopted by the Board (the " Effective Date ") and shall apply to Incentive Compensation that is received by Covered Executives on or after October 2, 2023, even if such Incentive Compensation was approved, awarded, or granted to Covered Executives prior to October 2, 2023. 

Amendment; Termination 

The Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect final regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and to comply with the Clawback Listing Standards and any other rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on which the Company's securities are listed. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time. 

Other Recoupment Rights 

Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. 

Relationship to Other Plans and Agreements 

The Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Board may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Policy and the terms of any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement under which Incentive Compensation has been granted, awarded, earned or paid to a Covered Executive, whether or not deferred, the terms of the Policy shall govern. 

Impracticability 

The Board shall recover any excess Incentive Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless such recovery would be impracticable, as determined by the Board in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and the listing standards of the national securities exchange on which the Company's securities are listed. 

Successors 

This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.
