Notes to Financial Statements 1. Trust Organization and Administration The San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (the Trust was established on November 1, 1980 when Southland Royalty Company Southland conveyed to the Trust a 75 net overriding royalty interest (the Royalty that burdens certain oil and gas interests (the Subject Interests in properties owned by Southland and located in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico. Subsequent to the conveyance of the Royalty, through a series of sales, assignments and mergers, Southland s successor became Hilcorp San Juan L.P. Hilcorp ), which acquired the Subject Interests from Burlington Resources Oil Gas Company LP Burlington on July 31, 2017. Through an acquisition completed on March 24, 2006, Compass Bank succeeded TexasBank as trustee of the Trust. On September 7, 2007, Compass Bancshares, Inc. was acquired by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. BBVA and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BBVA. Effective June 10, 2019, Compass Bank changed its name to BBVA USA. On June 1, 2021, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC announced that it had completed the purchase of BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc., a financial holding company, including its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, an Alabama-chartered bank and trustee of the Trust BBVA USA ). On October 8, 2021, PNC Bank, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of PNC, succeeded BBVA USA as the trustee of the Trust following BBVA USA s merger with and into PNC Bank. On February 15, 2024, Argent Trust Company succeeded PNC Bank as the trustee of the Trust following the resignation of PNC Bank. The defined term Trustee as used herein shall refer to PNC Bank for periods from October 8, 2021 through February 14, 2024, and shall refer to Argent Trust Company for periods on and after February 15, 2024. For all periods prior to October 8, 2021, use of the defined term Trustee herein shall refer to the entity serving as Trustee of the Trust during the applicable time period. On November 3, 1980, 46,608,796 Units in the Trust were distributed to the Trustee for the benefit of Southland shareholders of record as of November 3, 1980, who received one Unit in the Trust for each share of Southland common stock held. The Trust s initial public offering was completed in 1980. The Units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Holders of Units are referred to herein as Unit Holders. The terms of the Trust Indenture provide, among other things, that: The Trust shall not engage in any business or commercial activity of any kind or acquire any assets other than those initially conveyed to the Trust; 

 The Trustee may sell up to one percent (1 of the value (based on prior year engineering reports) of the Royalty in any 12-month period, but otherwise may not sell all or any part of the Royalty unless approved by holders of 75 of all Units outstanding. In either case, the sale must be for cash and the proceeds promptly distributed; 

 The Trustee may establish a cash reserve for the payment of any liability which is contingent or uncertain in amount; 

 The Trustee is authorized to borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust; 

 The Trustee will make monthly cash distributions to Unit Holders (see Note 3); and 

 The Trust will generally terminate upon the first to occur of the following events: (i) at such time as the Trust s gross revenue for each of two successive years is less than 1.0 million per year or (ii) the Unit Holders of at least 75 of all of the Units outstanding vote in favor of termination. 

 2. Net Overriding Royalty Interest and Distribution to Unit Holders The amounts to be distributed to Unit Holders Monthly Distribution Amounts are determined on a monthly basis by the Trustee. The Monthly Distribution Amount is an amount equal to the sum of cash received by the Trustee during a calendar month attributable to the Royalty, any reduction in cash reserves and any other cash receipts of the Trust, including interest, reduced by the sum of liabilities paid and any increase in cash reserves. If the Monthly Distribution Amount for any monthly period is a negative number, then the distribution will be zero for such month and such negative amount will be carried forward and deducted from future monthly distributions until the cumulative distribution calculation becomes a positive number, at which time a distribution will be made. Unit Holders of record will be entitled to receive the calculated Monthly Distribution Amount for each month on or before 10 business days after the monthly record date, which is generally the last business day of each calendar month. The cash received by the Trustee consists of the Net Proceeds generated by the owner of the Subject Interests multiplied by 75 . The initial carrying value of the Royalty of 133,275,528 represented Southland s historical net book value at the date of the transfer of the Trust. Accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2024, was 130,597,911.

3. Basis of Presentation The preceding condensed statement of assets, liabilities, and trust corpus as of December 31, 2023, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited interim condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Trust's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the opinion of the Trustee and based upon information provided to the Trust by Hilcorp, the present owner of Subject Interests originally owned by Southland in properties located in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included that are necessary to fairly present the assets, liabilities and trust corpus of the Trust at September 30, 2024, and the distributable income and changes in trust corpus for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The distributable income for such interim period is not necessarily indicative of the distributable income for the full year. The condensed financial statements of the Trust are prepared on the following basis and are not intended to present the financial position and results of operations of the Trust in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ): The Net Overriding Royalty Conveyance (as amended to date, the Conveyance conveyed to the Trust a 75 net overriding royalty interest that burdens the Subject Interests. The Trust receives royalty income Royalty Income equal to 75 of the Net Proceeds attributable to the Subject Interests. Net Proceeds, as used in the Conveyance, means the excess of Gross Proceeds received by Hilcorp during a particular period over Production Costs for such period. Gross Proceeds means the amount received by Hilcorp from the sale of production attributable to the Subject Interests, subject to certain adjustments (e.g., fuel, gathering and transportation). Production Costs include both capital and non-capital costs incurred by Hilcorp in operating the Subject Interests including development drilling, production and processing costs, applicable taxes, and operating charges. The calculation of Net Proceeds by Hilcorp for any month may include adjustments to proceeds and costs for prior months, which will affect the Royalty Income paid to the Trust and the distribution to Unit Holders for that month. 

 Although permitted under the Conveyance that transferred the Royalty to the Trust, Hilcorp has informed the Trust that, for wells operated by Hilcorp, it generally does not intend to accrue lease operating expenses to the Trust. 

 Hilcorp has informed the Trust that Gross Proceeds are typically reported to the Trust based on actual volumes and pricing. Proceeds from production in the first month are generally received by Hilcorp in the second month, the Royalty Income is paid by Hilcorp to the Trustee in the third month, and distribution by the Trustee to the Unit Holders is made in the fourth month. Net Proceeds for a calendar year are typically based on the actual oil and natural gas production during the period beginning with November of the preceding calendar year through October of the current calendar year. 

 Hilcorp has notified the Trust that non-operated revenue is reported to the Trust based on a three-month lag from operated revenues. Non-operated revenue for a calendar year is typically based on the actual natural gas and oil production during the period beginning with August of the preceding calendar year through July of the current calendar year. 

 Trust expenses recorded are based on liabilities paid and cash reserves established from Royalty Income for liabilities and contingencies. 

 Distributions to Unit Holders are recorded when declared by the Trustee. 

 The Conveyance provides that any excess production costs applicable to the Subject Interests over Gross Proceeds from such properties must be recovered from future Net Proceeds before Royalty Income is again paid to the Trust. The Trust is not obligated to reimburse Hilcorp for any excess Production Costs if future Gross Proceeds from the Subject Interests are insufficient to cover such costs. 

 Depletion and any impairment are recorded as a reduction in trust corpus instead of an expense. 

 The financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP because revenues are not accrued in the month of production; certain cash reserves may be established for liabilities and contingencies, which would not be accrued in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; expenses are recorded when paid, instead of when incurred; and amortization of the Royalty is calculated on a unit-of-production basis and is charged directly to the Trust corpus instead of as an expense. Most accounting pronouncements apply to entities whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, directing such entities to accrue or defer revenues and expenses in a period other than when such revenues were received, or expenses were paid. Because the Trust s financial statements are prepared on the modified cash basis, as described above, most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to the Trust s financial statements. This comprehensive basis of accounting corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC, as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts.

Table of Contents 

The Trustee routinely reviews the Trust s royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an impairment event occurs and it is determined that the carrying value of the Trust s royalty interests may not be recoverable, an impairment will be recognized as measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the royalty interests exceeds the fair value of these assets, which would likely be measured by discounting projected cash flows and is charged directly to the Trust corpus instead of as an expense. There was no impairment of the Trust s assets as of September 30, 2024. Certain amounts from previously presented condensed financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported distributable income or trust corpus. The reclassification adjustments were made to improve consistency and comparability of the financial information across periods. 4. Federal Income Taxes For federal income tax purposes, the Trust constitutes a fixed investment trust that is taxed as a grantor trust. A grantor trust is not subject to tax at the trust level. The Unit Holders are considered to own the Trust s income and principal as though no trust were in existence. The income of the Trust is deemed to have been received or accrued by each Unit Holder at the time such income is received or accrued by the Trust rather than when distributed by the Trust. The Trust is a widely held fixed investment trust WHFIT classified as a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment trust NMWHFIT for federal income tax purposes. The Trustee is the representative of the Trust that will provide tax information in accordance with the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT and a NMWHFIT. The Royalty constitutes an economic interest in oil and natural gas properties for federal income tax purposes. Unit Holders must report their share of the production revenues of the Trust as ordinary income from oil and natural gas royalties and are entitled to claim depletion with respect to such income. The Royalty is treated as a single property for depletion purposes. The Trust has on file technical advice memoranda confirming such tax treatment. Under present law, the Trust s production and sale of natural gas from coal seam wells does not qualify for tax credit under Section 45K of the Code (the Section 45 Tax Credit ). Congress has at various times since 2002 considered energy legislation, including provisions to reinstate the Section 45 Tax Credit in various ways and to various extents, but no legislation that would qualify the Trust s current production for such credit has been enacted. No prediction can be made as to what future tax legislation affecting Section 45K of the Code may be proposed or enacted or, if enacted, its impact, if any, on the Trust and the Unit Holders. The classification of the Trust s income, for purposes of the passive loss rules, may be important to a Unit Holder. Royalty Income, such as that derived through the Trust, will generally be treated as portfolio income that may not be offset or reduced by passive losses. The Trustee is of the opinion that the material tax positions taken by the Trust, related to the Trust s pass-through status and state tax positions, would more likely than not be sustained by examination. As of September 30, 2024, the Trust s tax years 2020 and thereafter remain subject to examination. Each Unit Holder should consult his or her own tax advisor regarding tax compliance matters related to such Unit Holder s interest in the Trust. 5. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies related to the Subject Interests that are unfavorably resolved would generally be reflected by the Trust as reductions to future Royalty Income payments to the Trust with corresponding reductions to cash distributions to Unit Holders. See Note 3 Basis of Presentation, for a summary of the terms of the Conveyance with respect to recovery of costs. Hilcorp transitioned to a new accounting system in 2021. During and immediately following the transition period, revenue and severance taxes on the distributions to the Trust were estimated. Then, in 2021 and 2022, various adjustments were made to reconcile actual revenue and severance taxes to the previously reported estimates. Hilcorp conducted a process review of the new accounting system that included review of production volume allocations for 2017 through 2020 and resulted in reallocations of affected volumes for many of the Trust properties. Through the Trustee's compliance audit process, certain exceptions to the several different categories of expenses (specifically offsite labor, overhead, operator-owned compressors and saltwater disposal facilities) for the years 2017 through 2020 were identified that the Trustee believed resulted in an underpayment of royalties owed to the Trust for those years. The Trustee engaged in extensive 

 6 

Table of Contents 

discussions with Hilcorp regarding these exceptions that culminated in Hilcorp s payment of the sum of 1,037,093, which included the accumulated interest incurred as a result of the underpayment. The compliance audit settlement payment was included in the September 2023 distribution to Unit Holders. Since the transition to Hilcorp's new accounting system in 2021, the Trustee has engaged and continues to engage with Hilcorp on an ongoing basis regarding Hilcorp's accounting and reporting to the Trust. The Trust s third-party compliance auditors continue to audit payments made by Hilcorp to the Trust, inclusive of sales revenues, production costs, capital expenditures, adjustments, actualizations, and recoupments. The Trust s auditing process has also included detailed analyses of Hilcorp s pricing and rates charged. As previously disclosed in the Trust s filings, these revenues and costs (along with all costs) are the subject of the Trust s ongoing comprehensive audit process by professional consultants and outside counsel to help evaluate compliance with the underlying operative Trust agreements and evaluate potential remedies in the event there is suspected non-compliance. 6. Certain Contracts As part of the transition from Burlington to Hilcorp, Hilcorp has assumed, or been assigned, all the natural gas purchase, gathering and processing contracts affecting the Subject Interests. Natural gas produced from the Subject Interests is processed at the following sites: Chaco, Val Verde, Milagro, Ignacio or Kutz plants, all located in the San Juan Basin. Hilcorp sells natural gas produced from the Subject Interests under various contracts. The Trust is not a party to any of the purchase, gathering or processing contracts, and thus the Trust has limited knowledge over the terms of the various contracts and lacks the ability to influence such terms. As part of the 1996 settlement of litigation filed by the Trustee in 1992 against Burlington and Southland, the Trustee and Burlington established a formal protocol pursuant to which compliance auditors, retained by the Trustee, have access to Burlington and its successors books and records, which protocol has been adopted by Hilcorp. 7. Significant Customers Information as to significant purchasers of oil and natural gas production attributable to the Trust's economic interests is included in Note 6 above. 8. Development Costs Hilcorp s capital budget plans for the Subject Interests are delivered to the Trustee at the beginning of each calendar year. The estimates are subject to change, based on, among other things, Hilcorp s actual capital requirements, the pace of regulatory approvals, the mix of projects and swings in the price of natural gas. Both the estimated annual capital expenditures and the actual expenses reported by Hilcorp include amounts attributable to capital budgets for prior years because capital expenditures are deducted in calculating Royalty Income in the month they accrue and projects within a given year s budget often extend into subsequent years. Further, Hilcorp s accounting period for capital expenditures runs from January through December 31 of each calendar year, which corresponds and is reported in Trust Distribution months March of the same calendar year through February of the following calendar year. In addition, with respect to wells not operated by Hilcorp, Hilcorp s share of capital expenditures may not be paid until the following year(s) after those expenses were incurred by the operator. On February 16, 2024, the Trust announced that Hilcorp had provided the Trust with its 2024 capital project plan for the Subject Interests (the 2024 Plan ), and Hilcorp estimated its 2024 capital expenditures for the Subject Interests to be 36.0 million. This plan was updated on March 6, 2024, with a reduction of approximately 2.0 million, bringing the total estimate of 2024 capital expenditures to 34.0 million. Hilcorp informed the Trust that its 2024 Plan will allocate approximately 25.0 million of the 2024 Plan s budget toward two drilling projects in the Mancos formation. Approximately 8.0 million of the 2024 Plan s budget will be allocated to 36 well recompletions and workovers scheduled to be completed in the Mesaverde and Fruitland Coal formations. Approximately 1.0 million of the 2024 Plan s budget will be allocated to facilities projects related to natural gas compression. Hilcorp further informed the Trust that its planned project status for 2024 is subject to revision if Hilcorp revises its assumptions underlying the 2024 Plan, in which event the actual capital costs may vary from these estimates. Hilcorp advised the Trustee that there were ten workover wells completed, two new wells in progress, and 11 workover wells in progress during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 9. Excess Production Costs For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Production Costs exceeded Gross Proceeds by 10,294,620 7,720,965 net to the Trust) and 11,517,368 8,638,026 net to the Trust), respectively. The cumulative balance of excess Production Costs as of September 30, 2024, was 11,517,368 8,638,026 net to the Trust). There were no excess Production Costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and there was no cumulative balance of excess Production Costs as of September 30, 2023. The Conveyance provides that any excess Production Costs applicable to the Subject Interests over the amount of 

 7 

Table of Contents 

Gross Proceeds from such properties must be recovered from future Net Proceeds before Royalty Income is again paid to the Trust. The Trust is not obligated to reimburse Hilcorp for any excess Production Costs if future Gross Proceeds from the Subject Interests are insufficient to cover such costs. As such, the cumulative balance of excess Production Costs as of September 30, 2024, is to be recovered in future periods when the Gross Proceeds exceed Production Costs for such period. 10. Settlements and Litigation None. 11. Subsequent Events On October 21, 2024, the Trust announced that it would not declare a monthly cash distribution to the holders of its units of beneficial interest Units for October 2024 due to lower natural gas prices and significantly increased production costs that exceeded proceeds during the production month of August 2024. Item 2. Trustee s Discu ssion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview Introduction The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand the Trust s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.

Overview The Trust is an express trust created under the laws of the state of Texas by the San Juan Basin Royalty Trust Indenture entered into on November 1, 1980, between Southland and The Fort Worth National Bank (the Original Indenture ). The Trust refers to the Original Indenture as it was amended and restated on September 30, 2002, further amended and restated on December 12, 2007, and further amended by the First Amendment to the San Juan Basin Amended and Restated Royalty Trust Indenture on February 24, 2024 as the Indenture in this Quarterly Report. PNC Bank, National Association PNC Bank ), served as the previous Trustee of the Trust from October 8, 2021, through February 14, 2024. Effective February 15, 2024, Argent Trust Company, a Tennessee chartered trust company Argent ), became the Trustee of the Trust. The principal office of the Trust is 3838 Oak Lawn Avenue, Suite 1720, Dallas, Texas 75219 (telephone number

Table of Contents 

(855) 588-7839). Argent Trust Company, as successor trustee of the Trust, is subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture. The defined term Trustee as used herein shall refer to PNC Bank (which maintains its offices at 2200 Post Oak Blvd., Floor 18, Houston, TX 77056) for periods from October 8, 2021, until February 14, 2024, and shall refer to Argent Trust Company (which maintains its offices at 3838 Oak Lawn Ave, Suite 1720, Dallas, Texas 75219) for periods on and after February 15, 2024. The Conveyance and the Royalty Pursuant to the Net Overriding Royalty Conveyance effective November 1, 1980, Southland conveyed the Royalty that burdens the Subject Interests in properties located in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico to the Trust. Subsequent to the Conveyance of the Royalty, through a series of sales, assignments and mergers, Southland s successor became Hilcorp, which acquired the Subject Interests from Burlington Resources Oil Gas Company LP Burlington ), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, on July 31, 2017. The Royalty constitutes the principal asset of the Trust. The beneficial interest in the Royalty is divided into 46,608,796 units (the Units representing undivided fractional interests in the beneficial interest of the Trust equal to the number of shares of the common stock of Southland outstanding as of the close of business on November 3, 1980. Each stockholder of Southland of record at the close of business on November 3, 1980, received one freely tradable Unit for each share of the common stock of Southland then held. Holders of Units in the Trust are referred to herein as Unit Holders. On August 30, 2023, the Trustee entered into a First Amendment to the Conveyance (the Amendment ). The Amendment was entered into (i) pursuant to the terms of the Compromise and Settlement Agreement entered into August 30, 2023, which resolved certain disputed expenses for the period from 2017 through 2020 by payment to the Trust and (ii) to modify certain terms of the Conveyance of the Royalty with respect to expenses associated with the operator s saltwater disposal facilities. The Trustee The primary function of the Trustee is to collect Royalty Income, to pay all expenses and charges of the Trust, and to distribute the remaining available income to the Unit Holders. The amount of income distributable to Unit Holders, which the Trust refers to as Distributable Income, depends on the amount of Royalty Income and interest received by the Trust, as well as the amount of expenses paid by the Trust and any change in cash reserves. The Trust has no employees, officers, or directors. The Trustee performs all administrative functions of the Trust. Argent Trust Company has served as Trustee since February 15, 2024. Hilcorp Hilcorp is the principal operator of the majority of the Subject Interests and is responsible, subject to the terms of a prior agreement with the Trust, for marketing the oil and natural gas production from such properties, either under existing sales contracts or under future arrangements, at the best prices and on the best terms it shall deem reasonably obtainable under the circumstances. A very high percentage of the Royalty Income is attributable to the production and sale of natural gas, from the Subject Interests, by Hilcorp. Accordingly, the market price and demand for natural gas produced and sold from the San Juan Basin heavily influences the amount of Royalty Income distributed by the Trust and, by extension, the price of the Units. Natural Gas and Oil. The sale of San Juan Basin assets, including the Subject Interests, from Burlington to Hilcorp closed on July 31, 2017. Under the terms of the sale, Hilcorp is required to make payments to Burlington if natural gas prices are above a certain price. Hilcorp has confirmed that in accordance with the Conveyance, Hilcorp will not charge the Trust any portion of such payments. Gross Proceeds and Severance Tax Estimates. Hilcorp transitioned to a new accounting system in 2021. During and immediately following the transition period, revenue and severance taxes on the distributions to the Trust were estimated. Then, in 2021 and 2022, various adjustments were made to reconcile actual revenue and severance taxes to the previously reported estimates. Hilcorp conducted a process review of the new accounting system that included review of production volume allocations for 2017 through 2020 and resulted in reallocations of affected volumes for many of the Trust properties. Through the Trustee s audit process, certain exceptions to the several different categories of expenses (specifically offsite labor, overhead, operator-owned compressors and saltwater disposal facilities) for the years 2017 through 2020 were identified that the Trustee believed resulted in an underpayment of royalties owed to the Trust for those years. The Trustee engaged in extensive discussions with Hilcorp regarding these exceptions that culminated in Hilcorp s payment of the sum of 1,037,093.45, which included the accumulated interest incurred as a result of the underpayment. The audit settlement payment was included in the September 2023 distribution to Unit Holders. Since the transition to Hilcorp s new accounting system in 2021, the Trustee has engaged and continues to engage with Hilcorp on an ongoing basis regarding Hilcorp s accounting and reporting to the Trust. The Trust s third-party compliance auditors continue to

audit payments made by Hilcorp to the Trust, inclusive of sales revenues, production costs, capital expenditures, adjustments, actualizations, and recoupments. The Trust s auditing process has also included detailed analyses of Hilcorp s pricing and rates charged. As previously disclosed in the Trust s filings, these revenues and costs (along with all costs) are the subject of the Trust s ongoing comprehensive audit process by professional consultants and outside counsel to help evaluate compliance with the underlying operative Trust agreements and evaluate potential remedies in the event there is suspected non-compliance. The amount of Gross Proceeds also depends on the volumes of natural gas and oil produced from the Subject Interests. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Trust cannot acquire new natural gas and oil assets, and as a result, Royalty Income is dependent on the natural gas and oil volumes attributable to the Subject Interests. Although Hilcorp and other operators of the Subject Interests may conduct drilling operations or well recompletions in the near term, the Subject Interests are depleting assets; Hilcorp has informed the Trust that it is unable to estimate the productive life of the Subject Interests. The reduction in proved reserve quantities is a common measure of depletion. Hilcorp s (or a future operator s) capital investments in the Subject Interests will affect the quantity of proved reserves and can offset any reduction in proved reserves. Lower commodity prices may also reduce the volume of natural gas and oil produced from the Subject Interests by Hilcorp. On February 16, 2024, the Trust announced that Hilcorp had provided the Trust with its 2024 capital project plan for the Subject Interests (the 2024 Plan ), and Hilcorp has estimated its 2024 capital expenditures for the Subject Interests to be 36.0 million. This plan was updated on March 6, 2024, with a reduction of approximately 2.0 million, bringing the total estimate of 2024 capital expenditures to 34.0 million. Hilcorp informed the Trust that its 2024 Plan will allocate approximately 25.0 million of the 2024 Plan s budget toward two drilling projects in the Mancos formation. Approximately 8.0 million of the 2024 Plan s budget will be allocated to 36 well recompletions and workovers scheduled to be completed in the Mesaverde and Fruitland Coal formations. Approximately 1.0 million of the 2024 Plan s budget will be allocated to facilities projects related to natural gas compression. Hilcorp further informed the Trust that its planned project status for 2024 is subject to revision if Hilcorp revises its assumptions underlying the 2024 Plan, in which event the actual capital costs may vary from these estimates. Hilcorp advised the Trustee that there were ten workover wells completed, two new wells in progress, and 11 workover wells in progress during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Under the terms of the Conveyance, production costs are deducted from Gross Proceeds in calculating Net Proceeds, which is multiplied by 75 to calculate Royalty Income. Production Costs generally means costs incurred on an accrual basis by Hilcorp in operating the Subject Interests, including both capital and non-capital costs. For example, these costs include development drilling, production and processing costs, applicable taxes and operating charges. However, Hilcorp informed the Trust that for wells operated by Hilcorp it did not intend to accrue lease operating expenses to the Trust. If Production Costs exceed Gross Proceeds in any month, the excess is recovered out of future Gross Proceeds prior to making any further payments to the Trust. However, the Trust is not otherwise liable for any Production Costs or other costs or liabilities attributable to the Subject Interests or the minerals produced therefrom. If at any time the Trust receives more than the amount due under the Royalty, it is not obligated to return such overpayment, but the amounts payable to it for any subsequent period are reduced by such amount, plus interest, at a rate specified in the Conveyance. The Trust and the Trustee have very limited authority to control the amount and timing of Production Costs. The Trustee continues to engage with Hilcorp regarding its ongoing accounting and reporting to the Trust, and the Trust s third-party compliance auditors continue to audit all payments made by Hilcorp to the Trust, including adjustments, true-ups, and recoupments. In addition, the Trustee continues to consult with outside counsel to review the rights of the Trust with respect to these matters and to evaluate any available potential legal remedies. Factors that Affect Net Proceeds. Generally, Net Proceeds are affected by (a) disruptions caused by weather, particularly winter storms that disrupt access to the production fields, (b) the timing and size of Hilcorp s capital expenditures, and other Production Costs, and (c) commodity prices. Weather. Hilcorp has advised the Trust that it is possible for it to experience disruptions during the winter months that could impact Hilcorp s ability to access fields and maintain production. Capital Expenditures. The timing and size of capital expenditures by Hilcorp have impacted and continue to impact Net Proceeds. Hilcorp s capital expenditures increased for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, by approximately 10,450,220 and 12,115,022, respectively. The increases in capital costs for the periods were primarily attributable to a substantially higher capital project spending budget for Hilcorp's 2024 Plan as compared to 2023. Commodity Prices . The Trust s income and monthly distributions from the Subject Interests are heavily influenced by the price of natural gas and oil. These prices may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil based on market uncertainty or a variety of additional factors that are beyond the Trustee s control.

Hilcorp has multiple gas purchase agreements that set forth the prices it will receive for the natural gas and oil produced from the Subject Interests. There is a differential in the prices reflected in the market indices and the prices received and reported because the prices received and reported vary by purchase agreement, and they are determined after deducting gathering, processing, and marketing costs for both gas and natural gas liquids. These purchase agreements and costs are subject to a comprehensive audit process by professional accountants and consultants. Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Royalty Income . Royalty Income consists of 75 of the monthly Net Proceeds attributable to the Royalty. Royalty Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was determined as shown in the following table:

 (3) Revenue included an audit settlement payment in February 2023 and related interest for the 2017 through 2020 disputed expenses audit and audit exceptions. 

 (4) Production Costs exceeded Gross Proceeds by 10,294,620 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and by 11,517,368 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Conveyance provides that any excess production costs applicable to the Subject Interests over Gross Proceeds from such properties must be recovered from future Net Proceeds before Royalty Income is again paid to the Trust. The Trust is not obligated to reimburse Hilcorp for any excess Production Costs if future Gross Proceeds from the Subject Interests are insufficient to cover such costs. 

 The Royalty Income distributed to the Trust for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was lower than that distributed during the same periods of 2023, due primarily to substantially higher capital project spending associated with Hilcorp's 2024 Plan. Additionally, Royalty Income was affected by a decline in natural gas prices and an increase in production costs, including capital expenditures and lease operating expenses. The average natural gas price decreased from 2.04 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.49 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average natural gas price decreased from 5.42 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.20 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Production of natural gas from the Subject Interests decreased from 5,989,625 Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 5,691,025 Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Production of natural gas from the Subject Interests also decreased slightly from 17,466,457 Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 16,743,796 Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Gross Proceeds from Subject Interests. Total Gross Proceeds decreased approximately 5.4 million, or 36.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total Gross Proceeds decreased 

 11 

Table of Contents 

approximately 59.5 million or 60.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same time period in 2023. The decreases were primarily due to lower natural gas prices and lower production volumes. Capital Expenditures. The timing and size of capital expenditures by Hilcorp have and will continue to impact Net Proceeds. Hilcorp's capital expenditures increased approximately 10,450,220 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased approximately 12,115,022 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same time period in 2023. The increase in capital costs in the three-month and nine-month periods were primarily attributable to the significantly higher capital project spending budget for Hilcorp's 2024 Plan (as defined below), as compared to the same periods in 2023. On February 16, 2024, the Trust announced that Hilcorp had provided the Trust with its 2024 capital project plan for the Subject Interests (the 2024 Plan ), and Hilcorp has estimated its 2024 capital expenditures for the Subject Interests to be 36.0 million. This 2024 Plan was updated on March 6, 2024, with a reduction of approximately 2.0 million, bringing the total estimate of 2024 capital expenditures to 34.0 million. Hilcorp informed the Trust that its 2024 Plan will allocate approximately 25.0 million of the 2024 Plan s budget toward two drilling projects in the Mancos formation. Approximately 8.0 million of the 2024 Plan s budget will be allocated to 36 well recompletions and workovers scheduled to be completed in the Mesaverde and Fruitland Coal formations. Approximately 1.0 million of the 2024 Plan s budget will be allocated to facilities projects related to natural gas compression. Hilcorp further informed the Trust that its planned project status for 2024 is subject to revision if Hilcorp revises its assumptions underlying the 2024 Plan, in which event the actual capital costs may vary from these estimates. Hilcorp informed the Trustee that there were ten workover wells completed, two new wells in progress, and 11 workover wells in progress during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Severance Taxes. Aggregate severance taxes decreased approximately 0.8 million, or 42 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased approximately 6.5 million or 57 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same time period during 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower Gross Proceeds. Severance taxes represented approximately 12 of Gross Proceeds for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 15 for the same period of 2023. Severance taxes represented approximately 13 of Gross Proceeds for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 12 for the same period of 2023. Lease Operating Expenses and Property Taxes. Lease operating expenses and property taxes increased 1.0 million or 15.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, lease operating expenses and property taxes increased approximately 2.8 million or 13.9 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As previously disclosed in the Trust s filings, these costs (along with all revenue and costs) are the subject of the Trust s ongoing comprehensive compliance audit process by professional consultants and outside counsel to help evaluate compliance with the underlying operative Trust agreements and evaluate potential remedies in the event there is suspected non-compliance. Excess Production Costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Production Costs exceeded Gross Proceeds by 10,294,620 7,720,965 net to the Trust) and 11,517,368 8,638,026 net to the Trust), respectively. The cumulative balance of excess Production Costs as of September 30, 2024, was 11,517,368 8,638,026 net to the Trust). There were no excess Production Costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and there was no cumulative balance of excess Production Costs as of September 30, 2023. The Conveyance provides that any excess Production Costs applicable to the Subject Interests over the amount of Gross Proceeds from such properties must be recovered from future Net Proceeds before Royalty Income is again paid to the Trust. The Trust is not obligated to reimburse Hilcorp for any excess Production Costs if future Gross Proceeds from the Subject Interests are insufficient to cover such costs. As such, the cumulative balance of excess Production Costs as of September 30, 2024, is to be recovered in future periods when the Gross Proceeds exceed Production Costs for such period. Distributable Income. Distributable Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was determined as shown in the following table:

There was no Distributable Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This was a decrease from 3.9 million 0.084685 per Unit) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Distributable income decreased approximately 89 from 48.0 million (1.029974 per Unit) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.2 million 0.110670 per Unit) for the same period in 2024. The decrease in Distributable Income was primarily attributable to significantly increased capital expenditures and a sharp decline in natural gas prices. Interest Income. Interest income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to the decrease in Royalty Income. General Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased slightly by 6,255 (2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased by 792,057 (57.8 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to differences in timing of the receipt and payment of certain expenses by the Trust, as well as expenses in the first half of 2024 associated with the transition to Argent Bank as Trustee of the Trust. Cash Reserves. Total cash reserves were 1,099,699 as of September 30, 2024. The Trustee is authorized to determine, in its discretion, the amount of cash reserves needed to cover liabilities and contingencies of the Trust. The Trustee previously maintained a cash reserve in the amount of 1,000,000. However, to cover Trust Expenses during any period of revenue shortfall, which has resulted and could continue to result from lower commodity prices or increased capital expenditures under Hilcorp's 2024 project plan for the Subject Interests, the Trustee increased the cash reserves in March and April of 2024, such that total cash reserves were 1,800,000 as of April 30, 2024. Cash reserves of 700,581, along with interest income, were utilized to pay the balance of Trust administrative expenses remaining (after applying interest income) each month from May through September 2024, when the Trust did not receive any Royalty Income. Prior to any distributions to Unitholders, the Trustee plans to replenish the cash reserves and continue to increase the cash reserves to 2,000,000. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Trust s principal source of liquidity and capital is Royalty Income. The Trust s distribution of income to Unit Holders is funded by Royalty Income after payment of Trust expenses. The Trust is not liable for any Production Costs or liabilities attributable to the Royalty. If at any time the Trust receives more than the amount due under the Royalty, it is not obligated to return such overpayment, but the amounts payable to it for any subsequent period are reduced by such amount, plus interest, at a rate specified in the Conveyance. If the Trustee determines that the Trust does not have sufficient funds to pay its liabilities, the Trustee may borrow funds on behalf of the Trust, in which case no distributions will be made to Unit Holders until such borrowings are repaid in full. The Trustee may not sell or dispose of any part of the assets of the Trust without the affirmative vote of the Unit Holders of 75 of all of the Units outstanding; however, the Trustee may sell up to 1 of the value of the Royalty (as determined pursuant to the Indenture) during any 12-month period without the consent of the Unit Holders. In each of July, August, and September 2024, the Trust did not receive any Royalty Income, and interest income received was insufficient to pay Trust liabilities. In the event the Trust does not receive Royalty Income from Hilcorp and interest income sufficient to pay its liabilities in future months, which is expected to occur given the significantly increased expenditures anticipated in Hilcorp's 2024 Plan, the Trust will continue to draw upon the cash reserves, and if needed, may borrow funds against the Royalty to cover the Trust s operating expenses until such time as the Trust's cash reserve can be replenished from subsequent Royalty Income payments from Hilcorp. Natural Gas and Oil Production The natural gas volumes reported to the Trust by Hilcorp are based on plant residue gas volumes plus equivalent volumes for natural gas liquids. Hilcorp converts one barrel of natural gas liquids to six Mcf of natural gas using industry standards. Royalty Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is associated with natural gas and oil production during the period from May 2024 through July 2024. Royalty Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is associated with natural gas and oil production from the Subject Interests during the period from November 2023 through July 2024. Production of natural gas and oil and related average sales prices attributable to each of the Subject Interests and the Royalty for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were as follows:

Based on Hilcorp s reporting methodology, the Trust recognizes production during the month in which the related Royalty Income is paid to the Trust. Royalty Income for a calendar year is based on the actual natural gas and oil production during the period beginning with November of the preceding calendar year through October of the current calendar year. Sales volumes attributable to the Royalty are determined by dividing the net profits by the Trust from the sale of natural gas and oil, respectively, by the prices received for sales of such volumes from the Subject Interests, taking into consideration production taxes attributable to the Subject Interests. Because the natural gas and oil sales attributable to the Royalty are based upon an allocation formula dependent on such factors as price and cost, including capital expenditures, the aggregate sales amounts from the Subject Interests may not provide a meaningful comparison to sales attributable to the Royalty. Production Volumes Natural Gas Natural gas production volumes decreased for the Subject Interests and the Royalty by 298,600 Mcf (5.0 and 8,110,010 Mcf (568.6 ), respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, natural gas production volumes decreased 722,661 Mcf (4.1 for the Subject Interests and 12,769,823 Mcf (173.2 for the Royalty compared to the same periods in 2023. Royalty volume is calculated using a formula determined by revenue less expenses. Excess production costs contributed to negative volumes for gas for the Royalty. The decrease in production volume was also affected by a natural decline in the producing properties, market conditions, and a decrease in demand. Natural gas production is also influenced by the line pressure of the natural gas gathering systems in the San Juan Basin. Oil Oil production volumes decreased for the Subject Interests by 6,181 Bbls (35.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Oil production volumes decreased for the Royalty by 5,565 Bbls (46.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, oil production volume decreased by 6,247 Bbls (19.5 for the Subject Interests and 6,087 Bbls (28.6 for the Royalty as compared to the same period in 2023. These changes generally resulted from changes in the demand for natural gas during the applicable time periods, natural gas inventory levels, availability of market conditions, and an increase in capital spending to generate production from new and existing wells. Sales Prices Natural Gas The average realized natural gas price per Mcf decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the El Paso Natural Gas Company, San Juan Basin Index pricing.

Oil The average realized oil price per Bbl increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the WTI benchmark oil price. Marketing There were no changes to the contracts pursuant to which Hilcorp sells production from the Subject Interests and for the gathering and processing of production during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements None. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates For a discussion of significant accounting policies and estimates that impact the Trust s financial statements, see Part I, Item 1. Unaudited Financial Statements, Note 3 Basis of Presentation in this Quarterly Report and Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data contained in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Hilcorp Information As a holder of a net overriding royalty interest, the Trust s reporting of financial information is reliant upon Hilcorp to accurately and timely report information regarding Hilcorp and its affiliates; the Subject Interests, including the operations, acreage, well and completion count, working interests, production volumes, sales revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses, reserves, drilling plans, drilling results and leasehold terms related to the Subject Interests, and factors and circumstances that have or may affect the foregoing.

Item 3. Quantita tive and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. None. Item 4. Cont rols and Procedures. The Trust maintains a system of internal disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the Trust s filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the times specified in the SEC s rules and forms. In its evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, the Trustee has relied, to the extent considered reasonable, on information provided by Hilcorp, the owner of the properties. Consequently, the Trust s ability to timely and accurately disclose relevant information in its periodic reports is dependent upon Hilcorp s timely delivery of accurate oil and gas revenue and production cost information and, therefore, the Royalty Income owed to the Trust. The Conveyance that transferred the royalty to the Trust obligates Hilcorp to provide the Trust with certain financial and operational information, including information concerning calculations of Royalty Income owed to the Trust. Once the Trust receives the financial information from Hilcorp, the Trust engages independent public accountants, compliance auditors, attorneys, and petroleum engineers in order to assist the Trustee in evaluating the accuracy and completeness of the information required to be disclosed in the Trust s periodic reports. These outside professionals advise the Trustee in its review and compilation of this information for inclusion in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the other periodic reports provided by the Trust to the SEC. The Trustee continues to engage with Hilcorp regarding its ongoing accounting and reporting to the Trust, and the Trust s third-party compliance auditors continue to audit payments made by Hilcorp to the Trust, inclusive of sales revenues, production costs, capital expenditures, adjustments, actualizations, and recoupments. The Trust s auditing process has also included detailed analysis of Hilcorp s pricing and rates charged. As previously disclosed in the Trust s filings, these revenues and costs (along with all costs) are the subject of the Trust s ongoing comprehensive audit process by our professional consultants and outside counsel to help evaluate compliance with the underlying operative Trust agreements and evaluate potential remedies in the event there is suspected non-compliance. The Trustee has evaluated the Trust s internal disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, and has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the reasonable assurance level (as such term is used in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act), to ensure that material information received from Hilcorp is gathered on a timely basis to be included in the Trust s periodic reports and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is used in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. Because the Trust does not have, nor does the Indenture provide for, officers, a board of directors or an independent audit committee, the Trustee has reviewed neither the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures nor the Trust s internal control over financial reporting in concert with management, a board of directors or an independent audit committee.
