The Company manages its coal sales by market and coal quality, not by individual mining complex. Geology, coal transportation routes to customers, and regulatory environments also have a significant impact on the Company s marketing and operations management. Mining operations are evaluated based on Adjusted EBITDA, per-ton cash operating costs (defined as including all mining costs except depreciation, depletion, amortization, accretion on asset retirement obligations, and pass-through transportation expenses, divided by segment tons sold), and on other non-financial measures, such as safety and environmental performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant in understanding and assessing the Company s financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash flows from operations or as a measure of our profitability, liquidity or performance under generally accepted accounting principles. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure the operating performance of its segments and allocate resources to the segments. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts and investors to evaluate the Company s operating performance. Investors should be aware that the Company s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company reports its results of operations primarily through the following reportable segments: Metallurgical (MET) segment, containing the Company s metallurgical operations in West Virginia, and the Thermal segment containing the Company s thermal operations in Wyoming and Colorado. Reporting segment results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below.

Proposed Merger with CONSOL Energy Inc. On August 20, 2024, the Company, CONSOL Energy Inc. CONSOL ), and Mountain Range Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL Merger Sub ), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement ), which provides for the combination of the Company and CONSOL in an all-stock merger transaction. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Arch (the Merger ), with Arch thereafter being a wholly owned subsidiary of CONSOL. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of Class A common stock, par value 0.01 per share, of Arch (the Arch Class A common stock and Class B common stock, par value 0.01 per share, of Arch (the Arch Class B common stock and together with the Arch Class A common stock, the Arch common stock will be automatically converted into the right to receive, without interest, 1.326 shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, of CONSOL CONSOL common stock (with cash in lieu of fractional shares). Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including approval by the Company s stockholders and CONSOL s stockholders, and receipt of required regulatory approvals. For more information on the Merger, see Note 3, Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement with CONSOL, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview Our results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were impacted by increasing softness in the global metallurgical coal markets and oversupply in domestic thermal coal markets. Economic growth remains constrained, particularly in Europe and the Americas, due to stubborn inflationary pressure. The central banks of many nations, including the Federal Reserve in the United States, have begun easing monetary policy as inflation rates have declined. Over time this easing of monetary policy may lead to improved economic growth. Recovery in economic growth could positively impact end user demand for our products and coal markets. Over two years have passed since the February 2022, Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the war continues with no indication any resolution is close. Major changes in energy trading patterns appear to be set while hostilities continue. Bans on the import of Russian coal by the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, and other nations continue to drive Russian coal into China, India, Turkey, and other Asian countries. These destinations have generally sourced Russian coals at discounts, sometimes significant discounts, from what similar quality coals from other origins would have required. We expect continued availability of discounted Russian coal into Asian markets. However, we believe most Russian coal is thermal and lower quality metallurgical and that the availability of high quality Russian coking coal is limited. During the year ended December 31, 2023, China effectively lifted the ban on imports of coal from Australia. While Australian coal is once again flowing into China, purchases of high-quality coking coal from Australia remain below pre-ban levels. Increased Chinese reliance on domestic production and increased imports of discounted Russian coal and Mongolian coal pressures import volumes from Australia. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Australian coking coal exports appear to be on track to increase compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in availability of Australian coking coal and relative softness in global demand resulted in a rapid decline in Pacific coking coal indices in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Atlantic coking coal indices declined and remain lower as well. We believe that some high cost coking coal sources are currently under economic pressure at current market levels.

 On March 26, 2024, a large container vessel lost power and struck one of the main support piers of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, plunging most of the span into the water and effectively blocking shipping access to Baltimore Harbor. One of the primary coking coal loading ports we use for loading export coal, the Curtis Bay Terminal (CBT), was blocked until the debris was removed and the main shipping channel was reopened on June 10, 2024. We worked diligently with our logistics partners to effectively maximize available throughput at our other primary coking coal loading port, Dominion Terminals Associates (DTA), in which we have a 35 ownership interest. We also contracted with a mid-streaming service to utilize some CBT capacity through the use of shallower draft temporary shipping channels that were opened prior to the main channel reopening. With respect to the global coking coal market, we believe that underinvestment in the sector in recent years underlies longer-term market dynamics. Overall, underinvestment in the sector appears likely to persist, as government policies and diminished access to traditional capital markets limit investment in the sector. Additionally, recent reports of new supply disruptions may also support these markets. The duration of specific supply disruptions is unknown. In the current macroeconomic environment, we expect coking coal prices to remain volatile. Longer term, we believe continued limited global capital investment in new coking coal production capacity, normal reserve depletion, and an eventual return to economic growth will provide support to coking coal markets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, domestic thermal coal consumption was pressured by a generally mild winter heating season in most of the heavily populated areas of the United States, low power demand, low natural gas prices, increased subsidized renewable generation, and high utility coal stockpiles. We believe that during the summer demand season, most coal powered generating facilities operated at levels that reduced utility coal stockpiles; however, these stockpiles remain elevated. Currently, natural gas prices are at levels such that we believe that economic dispatch decisions between coal-powered and natural gas-powered generation are being made on a plant specific basis. We have firm sales commitments for the current year for our thermal segment at volume levels that support economic mine operations, even though delivery of some of this volume is being deferred by agreement with some customers. Longer term, we continue to believe thermal coal demand in the United States will remain pressured by continuing increases in subsidized renewable generation sources, particularly wind and solar, competition from natural gas, and planned retirements of coal fueled generating facilities. Despite continuing moderation in the United States, international thermal coal markets remain strong, supporting continued export opportunities for our thermal operations. Currently, planned production levels at our thermal operations correspond with existing sales commitments as adjusted for deferrals. We are concurrently shrinking our operational footprint at our Powder River Basin operations and putting in place funding to pay for the eventual closure and final reclamation of these operations. Specifically, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we initiated a Voluntary Separation Plan VSP at our Thermal Segment operations to reduce the workforce in alignment with reduced sales volumes. For more information on our VSP, see Note 4, Severance Costs Related to Voluntary Separation Plan, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. During the first nine months of 2024, we contributed 5.7 million to our fund for asset retirement obligations, representing interest earned, bringing our total to 147.9 million. We plan to continue to grow the thermal mine reclamation fund through interest earnings. Longer term, we will maintain our focus on aligning our thermal production rates with the expected secular decline in domestic coal-fired power generation, while maximizing sales into export and industrial markets, and maintaining flexibility to react to short-term market fluctuations.

 Operational Performance Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Our mining operations are evaluated based on Adjusted EBITDA, per-ton cash operating costs (defined as including all mining costs except depreciation, depletion, amortization, accretion on asset retirements obligations, and pass-through transportation expenses, divided by segment tons sold), and on other non-financial measures, such as safety and environmental performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to us before the effect of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, the accretion on asset retirement obligations and nonoperating income (expenses). Adjusted EBITDA may also be adjusted for items that may not reflect the trend of future results by excluding transactions that are not indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant in understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash flows from operations or as a measure of our profitability, liquidity or performance under generally accepted accounting principles. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts and investors to evaluate our operating performance. Investors should be aware that our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following table shows results by operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures below for an explanation and a reconciliation of these amounts to the nearest GAAP measures. Other companies may calculate these per ton amounts differently, and our calculation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures. Metallurgical Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to decreased coal sales realization per ton sold, and Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was also impacted by reduced tons sold and increased cash cost per ton sold. As discussed previously in the Overview, coal sales realization per ton sold declined from the prior year periods, as weak global economic growth muted demand for finished steel products and an increase in high quality coking coal supply in international markets exerted downward pressure on international coking coal prices. While tons sold improved in the three months ended September 30, 2024, tons sold in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were negatively impacted by the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which effectively blocked our shipments of coking coal from one of our two main coking coal ports, the Curtis Bay Terminal (CBT), for most of the three months ended June 30, 2024. Cash cost per ton sold decreased in the three month period ended September 30, 2024, and increased in the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year periods in relation to the

Table of Contents 
 changes in tons sold for the respective periods. Our cash cost per ton sold benefitted in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, from a severance tax rebate of 12.8 million from the state of West Virginia received during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The West Virginia severance tax rebate is related to a law passed several years ago to encourage investment in the state and is based on capital investments that increase employment and production levels in the state. Our Metallurgical segment sold 2.1 million tons of coking coal and 0.4 million tons of associated thermal coal in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.2 million tons of coking coal and 0.1 million tons of associated thermal coal in the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 6.0 million tons of coking coal and 0.8 million tons of associated thermal coal, compared to 6.5 million tons of coking coal and 0.4 million tons of associated thermal coal in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Longwall operations accounted for approximately 75 of our shipment volume in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 79 of our shipment volume in the three months ended September 30, 2023, and approximately 75 of our shipment volume in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 77 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Thermal Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to decreased tons sold and increased cash cost per ton sold. As discussed previously in the Overview, tons sold declined due to weakness in the domestic thermal market related to low power demand, low natural gas prices, and increased renewable generation. Cash cost per ton sold increased primarily due to the decrease in sales volumes. Coal sales realization per ton sold increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in the percentage of higher value industrial and export sales in the sales mix.

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures Segment coal sales per ton sold Non-GAAP Segment coal sales per ton sold is calculated as segment coal sales revenues divided by segment tons sold. Segment coal sales revenues are adjusted for transportation costs, and may be adjusted for other items that, due to generally accepted accounting principles, are classified in other operating income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, but relate to price protection on the sale of coal. Segment coal sales per ton sold is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We believe segment coal sales per ton sold provides useful information to investors as it better reflects our revenue for the quality of coal sold and our operating results by including all income from coal sales. The adjustments made to arrive at these measures are significant in understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, segment coal sales revenues should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to coal sales revenues under generally accepted accounting principles.

 Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Segment Adjusted EBITDA The discussion in Results of Operations above includes references to our Adjusted EBITDA for each of our reportable segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to us before the effect of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, the accretion on asset retirement obligations and nonoperating (income) expenses. Adjusted EBITDA may also be adjusted for items that may not reflect the trend of future results by excluding transactions that are not indicative of our core operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure the operating performance of our segments and allocate resources to our segments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant in understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash flows from operations or as a measure of our profitability, liquidity or performance under generally accepted accounting principles. Investors should be aware that our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below shows how we calculate Adjusted EBITDA.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are proceeds from coal sales to customers and certain financing arrangements. Excluding significant investing activity, we intend to satisfy our working capital requirements and fund capital expenditures and debt-service obligations with cash generated from operations and cash on hand. We remain focused on prudently managing costs, including capital expenditures, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and ensuring adequate liquidity. Given the volatile nature of coal markets, we believe it remains important to take a prudent approach to managing our balance sheet and liquidity. Additionally, banks and other lenders have become increasingly hesitant to provide financing to coal producers, especially those with significant thermal coal exposure. Due to the nature of our business, we may be limited in accessing debt capital markets or obtaining additional bank financing, or the cost of accessing this financing could become more expensive. Our priority is to maintain our strong financial position with substantial liquidity and low levels of debt and other liabilities, while returning significant value to our stockholders. We ended the first nine months of 2024 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 255.9 million and total liquidity of 359.8 million. During the first nine months of 2024, capital expenditures were approximately 126.9 million, and we expect our capital spending to remain at maintenance levels for the foreseeable future. We believe our current liquidity level is sufficient to fund our business, including costs related to the proposed Merger and meet both our short-term (the next 12 months) and reasonably foreseeable long-term requirements. We expect to maintain minimum liquidity levels of approximately 250 million to 300 million, with a substantial portion of that held in cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid approximately 68.9 million to our stockholders in the form of dividends and spent approximately 30.7 million to repurchase our common stock. In conjunction with the announcement of the proposed merger with CONSOL, we have suspended share repurchases and have agreed to limit quarterly dividends to 0.25 per share. Our Board has declared a fixed dividend of 0.25 per share that will be paid on November 26, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 15, 2024. On January 18, 2023, the Office of Workers Compensation Programs OWCP proposed revisions to regulations under the Black Lung Benefits Act governing authorization of self-insurers. The revisions seek to codify the practice of basing a self-insured operator s security requirement on an actuarial assessment of its total present and future black lung liability. A material change to the regulations is the requirement that all self-insured operators must post security equal to 120 of their projected black lung liabilities. The proposed regulations were posted to the Federal Register on January 19, 2023 with written comments to be accepted within 60 days of this date. A subsequent extended comment period expired on April 19, 2023. On May 10, 2024, the OWCP forwarded its final rule establishing requirements for Black Lung Benefits Act self-insurance to the Office of Management and Budget OMB for review. OMB is charged by various executive orders to review significant regulations. OMB reviews are limited to 90 days and may be extended by an additional 30 days; however, OMB reviews often take longer. At this stage in the rulemaking process, no rule text is publicly available, and the final regulations have not yet been published. If the above regulation is codified into law, the Company will be required to post additional collateral to maintain its self-insured status. The Company is evaluating alternatives to self-insurance, including the purchase of commercial insurance to cover these claims. Additionally, the Company is assessing additional sources of liquidity, and other items to satisfy the proposed regulations. On February 8, 2024, the Company entered into a new senior secured term loan credit agreement in the principal amount of 20.0 million (the Term Loan with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative and collateral agent. The Term Loan requires quarterly principal amortization payments of 3.3 million and matures on June 30, 2025. The interest rate on the facility is, at the option of Arch Resources, either (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 plus an applicable margin of 3.00 , subject to a SOFR floor of 0.00 , or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.00 .

The amount of collateral required by counterparties is based on their assessment of our ability to satisfy our obligations and may change at the time of policy renewal or based on a change in their assessment. Future increases in the amount of collateral required by counterparties would reduce our available liquidity. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include long-term debt and related interest, leases, coal lease rights, coal purchase obligations, and unconditional purchase obligations. As discussed above, we increased our long-term debt by a principal amount of 20 million under our Term Loan during the first three months of 2024. There have been no other material changes to our contractual obligations from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off-balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, coal lease obligations and other obligations. There have been no material changes to our off-balance sheet arrangements from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For further information regarding off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flow The following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 212,359 453,818 Investing activities (141,140) (125,959) Financing activities (139,431) (380,821) Cash provided by operating activities decreased approximately 241.5 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in results from operations discussed in the Overview and Operational Performance sections above

 partially offset by a net favorable change in working capital of approximately 77.7 million when compared to the prior year. Cash used in investing activities increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased capital expenditures of approximately 5.9 million for maintenance capital and an increase in net short-term investment activity of approximately 10.2 million. Cash used in financing activities declined 241.4 million compared to the prior period, primarily due to a decrease of approximately 77.4 million in overall net debt payments compared to the prior year, a reduction in dividends paid of approximately 114.8 million, a decrease in share repurchases of 91.2 million, and a decrease of 43.9 million of proceeds from warrants exercised in the prior year. Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases it estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We manage our commodity price risk for our non-trading, thermal coal sales through the use of long-term coal supply agreements, and to a limited extent, through the use of derivative instruments. Sales commitments in the metallurgical coal market are typically not long term in nature, and we are therefore subject to fluctuations in market pricing. Our sales commitments for 2024 were as follows as of September 30, 2024: 

2024 Tons per ton Metallurgical (in millions) Committed, North America Priced Coking 1.5 157.04 Committed, North America Unpriced Coking Committed, Seaborne Priced Coking 5.2 140.68 Committed, Seaborne Unpriced Coking 1.1 Committed, Priced Thermal 0.9 30.92 Committed, Unpriced Thermal Thermal Committed, Priced 52.8 17.28 Committed, Unpriced 0.1 We have exposure to price risk for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course of production, such as diesel fuel, steel, explosives and other items. We manage our risk for these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers. We may sell or purchase forward contracts, swaps and options in the over-the-counter market in order to manage our exposure to price risk related to these items. We are exposed to price risk with respect to diesel fuel purchased for use in our operations. We anticipate purchasing approximately 30 to 35 million gallons of diesel fuel for use in our operations annually. To protect our cash flows from increases in the price of diesel fuel for our operations, we use forward physical diesel purchase contracts, purchased heating oil call options and New York Mercantile Exchange gulf coast diesel swaps and options. At September 30, 2024, the Company had protected the price of expected diesel fuel purchases for the remainder of 2024 with approximately 6 million gallons of heating oil call options with an average strike price of 3.10 per gallon. These positions are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and therefore, changes in the fair value are recorded immediately to earnings. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including commercial and employee injury claims. After conferring with counsel, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of these claims, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Item 1A. Risk Factors With the exception of the risk factors described and set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Risks Relating to the Merger The Merger may not be completed, and the Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms. The Merger is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Merger. These conditions may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may be delayed or may not be completed. In addition, if the Merger is not completed by August 20, 2025 (which date may be extended to November 20, 2025 in certain circumstances), either the Company or CONSOL may choose not to proceed with the Merger by terminating the Merger Agreement, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time, before or after stockholder approval. In addition, the Company and CONSOL may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances as described in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement limits the Company s ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger, may discourage other companies from trying to acquire the Company and, in specified circumstances, could require the Company to pay CONSOL a termination fee. The Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a competing proposal that might result in greater value to the Company s stockholders than the Merger, or may result in a potential acquirer of the Company proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire the Company than it might otherwise have proposed to pay. These provisions include a general prohibition on the Company soliciting or, subject to certain exceptions relating to the exercise of fiduciary duties by the Company s Board of Directors , entering into discussions with any third party regarding any competing proposal. Further, even if the Company s Board of Directors withholds, withdraws, qualifies or modifies its recommendation to stockholders with respect to the Company s merger-related stockholder proposals , unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company will still be required to submit such proposals to a vote by the Company s stockholders. The Merger A greement further provides that under specified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay CONSOL a cash termination fee of 82 million. Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the price of shares of Arch common stock, as well as the Company s future businesses and financial results. The Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Merger. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied or waived. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not be completed .

Table of Contents 
 If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including the failure to receive the required approvals of the Company s stockholders or CONSOL s stockholders, the Company s businesses and financial results may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, the Company would be subject to a number of risks, including as follows: the Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the market price of Arch common stock; the Company and its subsidiaries may experience negative reactions from their respective customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, landlords, joint venture participants and other third parties with whom they do business, which in turn could affect the Company s marketing operations or their ability to compete for new business or obtain renewals in the marketplace more broadly; the Company may experience negative reactions from employees; the Company will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees; and the Company will have expended time and resources that could otherwise have been spent on the Company s existing businesses and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to the Company, and the Company s ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected. Uncertainties associated with the Merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees of the Company and CONSOL, which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company following the Merger or, in the event the Merger is not completed, the Company. Each of the Company and CONSOL depends on the experience and industry knowledge of its officers and other key employees to execute its business plans. The success of the combined company after the Merger will depend in part on its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees of the Company and CONSOL may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the Merger or other concerns regarding the timing and completion of the Merger or the operations of the combined company following the Merger, any of which may have an adverse effect on the ability of the Company and CONSOL to retain or attract key management and other key personnel. If the Company or CONSOL is unable to retain personnel, including the Company s or CONSOL s key management, who are critical to the future operations of the companies, the Company and CONSOL could face disruptions in their operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs. In addition, the loss of key Company and CONSOL personnel could diminish the anticipated benefits of the Merger. No assurance can be given that the combined company following the Merger, will be able to retain or attract key management personnel and other key employees of the Company and CONSOL to the same extent that the Company and CONSOL have previously been able to retain or attract their own employees. These same risks apply to the ability of the Company to retain its key management personnel and other key employees, in the event the Merger is not completed. The business relationships of the Company and CONSOL may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Merger, which could have a material effect on the business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations of the Company or the combined company following the Merger. Parties with which the Company or CONSOL do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to current or future business relationships with the Company, CONSOL or the combined company following the Merger. The Company s and CONSOL s business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, landlords, joint venture participants and other third parties with whom they do business may attempt to delay or defer entering into new business relationships, negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than the Company, CONSOL or the combined company following the Merger. These disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on the 

 44 

Table of Contents 
 business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations of the Company, regardless of whether the Merger is completed, as well as a material and adverse effect on the combined company s ability to realize the expected cost savings and other benefits of the Merger. The risk, and adverse effects, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement subjects the Company to restrictions on its business activities prior to the effective time of the Merger. The Merger Agreement restricts the Company from entering into certain corporate transactions and taking other specified actions without the consent of CONSOL, and generally requires the Company to continue its operations in the ordinary course through the completion of the Merger. These restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time if completion of the Merger is delayed and could prevent the Company from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. The Company is expected to incur significant costs in connection with the Merger and integration of the two companies, which may be in excess of those anticipated by the Company. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with negotiating and completing the Merger and combining the operations of the two companies. These expenses have been, and will continue to be, substantial. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the M erger and include, among others, employee retention costs, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, severance and benefit costs, filing fees and debt restructuring costs. Many of these costs will be borne by the Company even if the Merger is not completed. The Company will also incur transaction costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. Expectations that the combined company will offset integration-related costs over time by the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. The costs described above, as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses, could adversely affect the financial condition, cash flows and operating results of the combined company following the completion of the Merger. Litigation relating to the Merger, if any, could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the Merger and/or substantial costs. Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition, merger or other business combination agreements like the Merger Agreement. Even if such a lawsuit is without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on the Company s and CONSOL s respective liquidity and financial condition. Lawsuits that may be brought against the Company, CONSOL or their respective directors could also seek, among other things, injunctive relief or other equitable relief, including a request to rescind parts of the Merger Agreement already implemented and to otherwise enjoin the parties from consummating the Merger. One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that no injunction by any governmental entity having jurisdiction over the Company, CONSOL or Merger Sub has been entered and continues to be in effect and no law has been adopted, in either case, that prohibits the closing of the Merger. Consequently, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Merger, that injunction may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed within the expected timeframe or at all, which may adversely affect the Company s and CONSOL s respective business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, either the Company or CONSOL may terminate the Merger Agreement if any governmental entity having jurisdiction over the Company, CONSOL or Merger Sub has issued any order, decree, ruling or injunction permanently prohibiting the closing of the Merger that has become final and nonappealable or if any law has been adopted that permanently prohibits the closing of the M erger, so long as the Company s (in the case of a termination by the Company) or CONSOL s or Merger Sub s (in the case of a termination by CONSOL) failure to fulfill any material covenant or agreement under the Merger

 Agreement has not been the cause of, materially contributed to or resulted in such order, decree, ruling, injunction or other action. There can be no assurance that any of the defendants would be successful in the outcome of any potential future lawsuits. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Merger is completed may adversely affect the combined company s business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. If the Merger is completed, the failure to integrate the businesses and operations of the Company and CONSOL successfully in the expected time frame may adversely affect the combined company s future results. The Company and CONSOL have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate independently. If the Merger is completed, their respective businesses may not be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Company employees or key CONSOL employees; the loss of customers, service providers, vendors or other business counterparties; the disruption of either company s or both companies ongoing businesses; inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays, or regulatory conditions associated with and following completion of the Merger; or higher-than-expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. In addition, at times the attention of certain members of either company s or both companies management and resources may be focused on completion of the Merger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations or other opportunities that may be beneficial, which may disrupt each company s ongoing operations and the operations of the combined company. Furthermore, if the Merger is completed, the board of directors and executive leadership of the combined company will consist of former directors from each of the Company and CONSOL and former executive officers from each of the Company and CONSOL, respectively. Combining the boards of directors and management teams of each company into a single board and a single management team could require the reconciliation of differing priorities and philosophies. If the Merger is completed, the combined company may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The success of the Merger, if it is completed, will depend, in part, on the Company s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the Company s and CONSOL s businesses and operational synergies. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, may not be realized or could have other adverse effects that the Company does not currently foresee, in which case, among other things, the Merger may not be accretive to free cash flow and may not generate significant discretionary cash flow to return to stockholders via share buybacks or other means. Some of the assumptions that the Company has made, such as the achievement of the anticipated benefits related to the geographic, commodity and asset diversification and the expected size, scale, inventory and financial strength of the combined company, may not be realized if the Merger is completed. The integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. In addition, there could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the Merger that could adversely impact the combined company. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds During the second quarter of 2022, our Board of Directors increased the remaining outstanding authorization for share repurchases to 500 million. In conjunction with announcement of the proposed merger with CONSOL, we have suspended share repurchases. No share repurchases were made in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

EXHIBIT 95 Mine Safety and Health Administration Safety Data We believe that Arch Resources, Inc. Arch Resources is one of the safest coal mining companies in the world. Safety is a core value at Arch Resources and at our subsidiary operations. We have in place a comprehensive safety program that includes extensive health safety training for all employees, site inspections, emergency response preparedness, crisis communications training, incident investigation, regulatory compliance training and process auditing, as well as an open dialogue between all levels of employees. The goals of our processes are to eliminate exposure to hazards in the workplace, ensure that we comply with all mine safety regulations, and support regulatory and industry efforts to improve the health and safety of our employees along with the industry as a whole. The operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations, orders and violations when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. We present information below regarding certain mining safety and health violations, orders and citations, issued by MSHA and related assessments and legal actions and mine-related fatalities with respect to our coal mining operations. In evaluating the above information regarding mine safety and health, investors should take into account factors such as: (i) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of a coal mine, (ii) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine, and (iii) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and in that process are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed or vacated. The table below sets forth for the three months ended September 30, 2024 for each active MSHA identification number of Arch Resources and its subsidiaries, the total number of: (i) violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard under section 104 of the Mine Act for which the operator received a citation from MSHA; (ii) orders issued under section 104(b) of the Mine Act; (iii) citations and orders for unwarrantable failure of the mine operator to comply with mandatory health or safety standards under section 104(d) of the Mine Act; (iv) flagrant violations under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act; (v) imminent danger orders issued under section 107(a) of the Mine Act; (vi) proposed assessments from MHSA (regardless of whether Arch Coal has challenged or appealed the assessment); (vii) mining-related fatalities; (viii) notices from MSHA of a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the Mine Act; (ix) notices from MSHA regarding the potential to have a pattern of violations as referenced in (viii) above; and (x) pending legal actions before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (as of September 30, 2024) involving such coal or other mine, as well as the aggregate number of legal actions instituted and the aggregate number of legal actions resolved during the reporting period.
