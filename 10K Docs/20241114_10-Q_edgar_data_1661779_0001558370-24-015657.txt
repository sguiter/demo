 STARTENGINE CROWDFUNDING, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) NOTE 1 NATURE OF OPERATIONS StartEngine Crowdfunding, Inc. (the Company was formed on March 19, 2014 Inception in the State of Delaware. The Company was originally incorporated as StartEngine Crowdsourcing, Inc. and changed to the current name on May 8, 2014. The Company s headquarters are located in Burbank, California. The Company aims to revolutionize the startup financing model by helping both accredited and non-accredited investors invest in private companies on a public platform. StartEngine Crowdfunding Inc. has wholly-owned subsidiaries, StartEngine Capital LLC, StartEngine Secure LLC, StartEngine Assets LLC and StartEngine Primary LLC. StartEngine Capital LLC is a funding portal registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), StartEngine Secure LLC is a transfer agent registered with the SEC. StartEngine Assets LLC was formed in 2020 to buy, hold and manage assets in various asset classes such as real estate, automobiles, luxury goods and royalty-producing intangible assets. StartEngine Primary LLC was formed in October 2017 and received approval to operate as a registered broker-dealer in July 2019. On April 16, 2020, StartEngine Primary LLC received approval to operate as an alternative trading system. Since 2023, the Company has been providing accredited investors the opportunity to purchase membership interests in funds SE Funds which own shares of venture capital backed, late-stage private companies via its StartEngine Private product offering. The SE Funds are managed by StartEngine Private Manager LLC and advised by StartEngine Adviser LLC, an exempt reporting adviser. The Company s mission is to empower thousands of companies to raise capital and create significant amounts of jobs over the coming years. Management Plans The Company s revenue producing activities commenced in 2015 with the approved start of Title IV of the JOBS Act, which created new rules for Regulation A, and increased since then with the start of Regulation Crowdfunding under Title III of the JOBS Act. Because this is a relatively new industry, there is a level of uncertainty about how fast the volume of activity will increase and how future regulatory requirements may change the landscape as well as the cost of maintaining our market share as well as entrance of other players. Because there is a level of uncertainty and because we are still in the early stages of these new regulations, the Company is expected to incur losses until such time that the volume of Regulation A, Regulation D and Regulation Crowdfunding campaigns and the investments in those campaigns is sufficient for revenues derived from those campaigns to cover its costs. These factors could indicate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has cash and cash equivalents of approximately million, which its management believes will cover losses for the foreseeable future. The Company s management believes that any substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern has been alleviated. On May 6, 2024, StartEngine Crowdfunding Inc. split its designated Common Stock and Preferred Stock on a 20 for 1 basis. The total number of shares of Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue was increased to shares after the split. The total number of shares of Preferred Stock that the Company is authorized to issue was increased to after the split. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect this stock split. Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements During the financial reporting process for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company identified a prior period accounting error related to the Company s estimate for stock investment write down; specifically, it was determined that the value of certain stocks needed to be written down. This write down was applied to the year-end numbers included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 in Form 10-K. To be in compliance with GAAP, the impairment needed to be conducted on a quarterly basis. The Company concluded that the error had no material impact to any prior interim period. Notwithstanding this conclusion, the Company corrected the errors by revising the consolidated 2023 accompanying consolidated interim financial statements and related notes to give effect to the correction of this error.

In all cases, there were sales of the stock to the public through Regulation Crowdfunding, Regulation A, or a Regulation D funding mechanism, but such sales are often not to the level that an active market existed or exists. After the sales, such shares are often illiquid, and a change in valuation is often difficult to determine due to the lack of information available. Information regarding these unobservable inputs could correspondingly change the value of these assets. For warrants, the Company also adjusts the expected life of certain warrants to account for potential liquidation events, as well as doubts regarding the ability for the issuer companies to continue as a going concern. The quantitative measure used is based upon Black-Scholes modeling. Significant judgment is required by Management in selecting unobservable inputs, and accordingly a change in the assumptions used for the valuation could cause the value to be significantly different. In general, increases in underlying share prices, expected life and volatility, increase the value of the warrants, whereas decreases would reduce the value. For Investments Stock, the primary and most significant unobservable input relates to the share value of the issuers. In all cases, there were sales of the stock to the public through Regulation Crowdfunding, Regulation A, or a Regulation D funding mechanism, but such sales are often not to the level that an active market existed or exists. After the sales, such shares are often illiquid, and a change in valuation is often difficult to determine due to the lack of information available.

Investments Private The Company purchases shares of venture capital backed, late-stage private companies and records the purchases at cost. The cost of the underlying asset includes the purchase price, and acquisition expenses, which include all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the evaluation, investigation, and acquisition of the underlying securities. The Company purchases the private company shares either directly or through other special purpose vehicles and after a certain period of time sells its investment to an SE Fund.

As the underlying building does not have a readily available fair market value, the company alternatively measures the investment at cost, minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments through income for observable price changes. To date, the investment has not had any observable price changes, and as such, has not been impaired. On August 8, 2024 the Company executed a contract to sell a partial membership of the building.

 for the purchased assets based on historical investment data for users of the StartEngine platform. In 2023, the Company received investments from users with accounts created from 2015-2023 and have seen a continuation of that trend in to 2024. As the Company continues to provide new offerings and work on outreach to users, we believe that this purchase will maintain its useful life for the duration. This amortization will begin in Q3 2023 and continue until the end of Q2 2030. As part of the acquisition of the SeedInvest business, the Company acquired a significant intangible asset in the form of a customer list. At the time of acquisition, the Company determined the fair value of the acquired assets, noting that approximately of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in the customer list. The value of intellectual property and various immaterial contracts with vendors was deemed insignificant, and no fair value was assigned to those assets. All contracts have since been canceled, and the SeedInvest webpage and domain are solely used as a redirect to the Company s site, where users must set up new accounts with the Company. The acquisition did not include any fixed assets, vehicles, equipment, machinery, tools, furnishings, computer hardware, or fixtures, as outlined in Section 2.1(b) of the Asset Purchase Agreement. In accordance with the guidance in FASB ASC 350-30-35-14, the Company evaluates the customer list for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives involves comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company considers various factors that may indicate impairment of the customer list, including but not limited to: 
 Declines in customer retention rates. Reductions in revenue per customer. Changes in market conditions affecting the value of the customer relationships. 
 Strategic shifts that alter the utility of the acquired customer list.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our most recent Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss certain factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our Company StartEngine Crowdfunding, Inc. was incorporated on March 19, 2014 in the State of Delaware. The Company was originally incorporated as StartEngine Crowdsourcing, Inc., but changed to the current name on May 8, 2014. The Company s revenue-producing activities commenced in 2015 with the effectiveness of the amendments to Regulation A under the Securities Act adopted in response to Title IV of the JOBS Act. Operations expanded in 2016, as Regulation Crowdfunding, adopted in response to Title III of the JOBS Act, went into effect. On June 10, 2019, our subsidiary, StartEngine Primary LLC, was approved for membership as a broker-dealer with FINRA. The Company s subsidiary, StartEngine Adviser LLC filed as an exempt reporting advisor with the SEC on January 8, 2024. Business and Trends For Regulation A offerings, our broker-dealer subsidiary is permitted to charge commissions to the companies that raise funds on our platform. Regulation A offerings are subject to a commission ranging between 4 and 7 and usually include warrants to purchase shares of the Company or the securities that are the subject of the offering. The amount of commission is based on the risks and other factors associated with the offering. Through StartEngine Primary, we can also charge commissions on Regulation D offerings hosted on our platform. During the periods covered in these financial statements we did not receive any Regulation D commissions. In Regulation Crowdfunding offerings, our funding portal subsidiary is permitted to charge commissions to the companies that raise funds on our platform. We typically charge 6 to 10 for Regulation Crowdfunding offerings on our platform. We also generate revenue from services, which include a consulting package for Regulation Crowdfunding issuers called StartEngine Premium priced at 15,000 to help companies who raise capital with Regulation Crowdfunding, as well as transfer agent services marketed as StartEngine Secure. We additionally charge a 1,000 fee for certain amendments we file on behalf of companies raising capital under Regulation Crowdfunding as well as fees to run the required bad actor checks for companies utilizing our services. The Company also receives revenues from other programs such as the StartEngine Venture club (formerly OWNers bonus) program and StartEngine Secondary. Our annual memberships for the StartEngine Venture Club bonus program are 275 per year. We launched StartEngine Secondary on May 18, 2020 and generate revenues by charging trade commissions to the sellers of the shares. Through September 30, 2024, twenty-seven additional companies are quoted on this platform. In Q3 2023 the Company began providing accredited investors the opportunity to purchase membership interests in funds SE Funds which own shares of venture capital backed, late-stage private companies via its StartEngine Private product offering. The SE Funds are managed by StartEngine Private Manager LLC and advised by StartEngine Adviser LLC, an exempt reporting adviser. Trend Information We are operating in a relatively new industry and there is a level of uncertainty about how fast the volume of activity will increase and how future regulatory requirements may change the landscape. We continue to innovate and introduce new products to include in our current mix as well as continuing to improve our current services such as providing liquidity for our investors and issuers. As we are a financial services company, our business, results of operations, and reputation are directly affected by elements beyond our control, such as economic and political conditions including unemployment rates, inflation and tax and interest rates, financial market volatility (such as we experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic), broad trends in business and finance, and changes in the markets in which such transactions occur (such as the bear markets that developed for equities in the second and third quarter of 2022), we might be disproportionately affected by declines in investor confidence caused by adverse economic conditions. On June 10, 2019, our subsidiary, StartEngine Primary LLC, was approved for membership as a broker-dealer with FINRA. Since our approval as a broker-dealer, we have experienced increased costs for payroll and training that we believe continue to increase relative to our revenue. We anticipate that this trend will continue into 2024 as the Company explores new avenues for revenue and growth. In addition, in April 2020 we received approval to operate an ATS. StartEngine Primary launched its ATS, branded as StartEngine

 Secondary on May 18, 2020. StartEngine Secondary has a limited operating history, and even though over 400 issuers have signed to be quoted on this platform, only twenty-two companies have been quoted on this platform to date, including the Company itself. Currently, for StartEngine Secondary, we generate revenues by charging trade commissions to the sellers of the shares and we intend to generate revenues by charging a 5 commission to the seller. We have experienced increased costs due to technology and operations related to the operation of our ATS. We anticipate operating the ATS will initially increase our overall expenses by 50,000 per month. Further, we anticipate receiving increased revenue related to offerings under Regulation A. On August 6, 2023, the Company launched StartEngine Private , a venture to provide accredited investors the opportunity to purchase membership interests in series which own shares of VC backed, and generally late-stage private companies(the underlying securities ). The Company treats the amount it receives for selling underlying securities as revenues, and the acquisition cost related to such underlying securities as cost of revenues. We additionally have engaged and trained and anticipate having to engage and train further additional compliance personnel, to better ensure continued compliance with FINRA and SEC regulatory requirements and also in order to expand our broker-dealer operations. Further we anticipate hiring additional sales and marketing personnel to help increase our customer base with respect to both issuers as well as investors Operating Results Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 The following table summarizes the results of our operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 Q3 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 Q3 2023 ).

 Our revenues during the three months ended were 9,578,992 which represented an increase of 3,877,075 or 68 , from revenues in the same period in 2023. The following are the major components of our revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 : 

Three Months Three Months Ended September 30, Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Regulation Crowdfunding platform fees 1,477,360 3,169,997 (1,692,637) Regulation A commissions 802,539 255,403 547,136 StartEngine Premium 504,500 739,380 (234,880) StartEngine Secure 379,320 428,772 (49,452) StartEngine Private 5,011,080 5,011,080 Venture Club (formerly OWNers Bonus) revenue 1,328,000 1,067,649 260,351 Other service revenue 76,193 40,716 35,477 Total revenues 9,578,992 5,701,917 3,877,075 The increase in total revenues in three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to StartEngine Private, which began generating revenue in Q4 2023. The 5,011,080 represents closings on 27 StartEngine Private offerings, and the Company plans to continue growing this revenue source in the future. Though this is a significant increase in revenues we note this is a lower margin product, see Cost of Revenue below. In addition, revenue was also impacted by the following: Decrease in Regulation Crowdfunding platform fees of 1,692,637. This is primarily due to fewer issuers raising on the platform in 2024. At the beginning of the year 2024, the Company shifted strategy to having fewer issuers raising with higher likelihood to succeed. While this strategy did bring the average raise per issuer from 329,775 in 2023 to 360,230 in 2024, the decrease in number of issuers had a larger effect on revenue than anticipated. While this process began in the beginning of 2024, the impact of this decision did not begin to materialize as a decrease in revenue until the end of Q2 2024 and throughout Q3 2024. As such the Company has adjusted its strategy to host more issuers on the platform starting in Q3 2024 onward. The Company also experienced the slow down in investments that affected all lines of business in Q3 2024 relating to slowing economic growth. I n Q3 2024 , the Company raised approximately 15.7 million for 103 issuers compared with Q3 2023 of raising approximately 29.8 million from 113 issuers. The top 5 raises in Q3 2024 raised 3.6 million vs 7.9 million for the top 5 issuers in Q3 2023. Increase in Regulation A commissions of 547,136, was due primarily to higher amounts raised from the top raises in Regulation A offerings. Regulation A revenue is more sensitive to revenue variance based on the performance of the top raisers, and while there were fewer Regulation A issuers in Q3 2024, the higher amount raised compared to Q3 2023 offset the decrease in number of issuers. In Q3 2024, the Company raised approximately 11.2 million for 5 issuers including 8.7 million from the top 2 issuers. In Q3 2023, the Company hosted Regulation A offerings for 8 issuers for a combined raise amount of 3.1 million including 1.9 million from the top 2 issuers. Decrease in StartEngine Premium revenue of 234,880 primarily due to an decrease in issuers charged for the service. Premium is collected upon the first disbursement for an issuer. As the Company has had fewer new issuers in 2024, there have been fewer initial disbursements in which Premium would be paid to the Company. Specifically, in Q3 2024, the Company had 43 issuers charged for Premium via disbursement compared to 57 in Q3 2023. Decrease in revenues of 49,452 from StartEngine Secure, primarily due to a decrease in number of issuers utilizing the service. Specifically, StartEngine Secure had 364 companies utilizing Secure as of September 30, 2024 compared with 600 companies as of September 30, 2023 . The Company had previously collected the Secure fees for the first year via disbursements and renewed on an annual basis, however in 2024 the Company switched to a monthly subscription model offering tiered services to incentivize continued use of the service as well as increase revenue generation. Due to this switch, the Company was able to mitigate loss on Secure revenue despite a significant decrease in total users.

 Increase in StartEngine Venture Club revenue of 260,351 related to increased sales of Venture Club during 2023 as the company adds greater focus towards growing this revenue source. Venture Club memberships are annual packages, which are recognized over 12 months, see Note 2 Revenue Recognition to the accompanying financial statements. Increase in other service revenue of 35,477 primarily from an increase in number of ancillary services including material amendments to issuer agreements in Q3 2024. Specifically, the Company recorded 70,670 in revenue from material amendments in Q3 2024 compared to 12,892 in Q3 2023. 

 Offerings can span multiple periods and the amount raised during the period is based on the amounts closed on during that period. Cost of Revenues Our cost of revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 5,411,753, which represented an increase of 3,695,838, or 215 , from the amounts during the same period in 2023 . The increase was primarily due to the addition of cost of revenue related to StartEngine Private, which began sales in the last quarter of 2023 and totaled 3,165,399 for Q3 2024. For StartEngine Private, cost of revenues includes the costs of purchasing the stock as well as commission for sales of the issuance, and our gross margin for this product in Q3 2024 was 29 . Additionally, credit card fees increased 123,611 due to the company incurring more transaction fees on behalf of issuers in connection with Regulation A and Regulation Crowdfunding offerings. Our gross margin in the third quarter of 2024 decreased to 44 compared to 70 during the same period in 2023. Operating Expenses Our total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 10,959,736 , which represented an increase of 2,543,383, or 30 , from the expenses in the same period in 2023. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to the following: Increase in general and administrative expenses of 980,849 was primarily due to amortization of the company s SeedInvest intangible asset of 857,143. Increase in sales and marketing expenses of 1,100,837 were primarily due to an increase in salary expense of 532,115 as the Company hired more sales staff to bring in additional business, as well as an increase stock-based compensation of 365,375 as the number of employees with vesting stock options increased from 2023 to 2024. Finally, an increase in market research expense of 118,811 in additional efforts to determine methods to increase investments in the platform. Increase of research and development expenses of 207,085 driven by an increase in stock-based compensation of 277,517 as the number of employees with vesting stock options increased from 2023 to 2024. Increase in write down of shares received by 254,612 due to additional companies being written down from 2023 to 2024 in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2203. 
 Other Expense (Income), net Our other income, net during the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 20,718, which represented cashback earned from our credit cards during the period as well as interest earned in the Company s money-market accounts. During the same period in 2023 our other income, net was 20,286. Net Loss (Income) Net loss attributable to stockholders totaled 6,785,964 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2,336,433 compared to the net loss attributable to shareholders of 4,449,531 recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Though the Company notes this is a significant increase in revenues we also note this is a lower margin product, see Cost of Revenue below. In addition, revenue was also impacted by the following: Decrease in Regulation Crowdfunding platform fees of 1,632,944. This is primarily due to fewer issuers raising on the platform in 2024. At the beginning of the year 2024, the Company shifted strategy to having fewer issuers raising with higher likelihood to succeed.

Increase in Regulation A commissions of 368,199, were due primarily to higher amounts raised from Regulation A offerings. In nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised approximately 6.8 million for 7 issuers including 4.1 million from the top 3 issuers.

Increase in sales and marketing expenses of 2,586,666 was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation by 1,256,476 as the number of employees with vesting stock options increased from 2023 to 2024. Additionally, advertising expense increased 517,967 from 2023 to 2024 as the Company was unable to capitalize advertising expense relating to it s own raise, which will not begin until Q4 2024. Finally, salaries related expenses increased 258,895 as the Company hired more sales staff to bring in additional business. Increase in research and development expenses of 1,536,458 driven by an increase in employee payroll of 360,482 as the company increases headcount of engineers to develop the company s platform and additional services. Additionally, there was increase in stock-based compensation by 1,174,736 as the number of employees with vesting stock options increased from 2023 to 2024. Decrease in write down of shares received for fees of 40,924. 
 Other Expense (Income), net Our other income, net during nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 43,301, which represented cashback received from the Company s credit cards. During the same period in 2023 our other income, net other income was 65,462 which primarily represented cash back from our credit card program. Net Loss (Income) Net loss attributable to stockholders totaled 13,828,694 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3,266,379 compared to the net loss attributable to shareholders of 10,562,315 recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include the value of marketable securities, the value of stock and warrants received as compensation and collectability of accounts receivable. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. It is reasonably possible that changes in estimates will occur in the near term. A significant portion of the Company s assets relate to investments in stock and warrants received as compensation from issuer companies undertaking Regulation Crowdfunding or Regulation A offerings. As described in Note 2, in the accompanying financial statements, stock and warrants require significant unobservable inputs, primarily related to the underlying stock price of the security received which may include marketability discounts. Warrants have further unobservable inputs related to the estimated life. In all cases, there were sales of the stock to the public through Regulation Crowdfunding or Regulation A funding mechanism, but such sales are often not to the level that an active market existed or exists. Once the funding round is concluded it is difficult to ascertain the fair value of the issuer shares or the status of the issuer s financial health, unless additional rounds of financing are undertaken in a public setting, or the issuer reports reliable and regular information publicly. Any change in the underlying shares would impact on the valuation of the related investments. Shares held are generally illiquid. Valuations require significant management judgment related to these unobservable inputs. As many of the companies that undertaking Regulation Crowdfunding and Regulation A are considered emerging growth companies, require significant capital to maintain or commence operations, and often contain warnings regarding substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, it is reasonable to conclude that through the passage of time, a significant portion of the stock and warrants held by the Company will ultimately be deemed worthless, decline in value, or in the case of warrants, expire without exercise. Similar to traditional venture capital results, it is reasonable to conclude that only a small portion of each investment may ever increase in value. Investments Warrant Assets In connection with negotiated platform fee agreements, we may obtain warrants giving us the right to acquire stock in companies undergoing Regulation A offerings. We hold these assets for prospective investment gains. We do not use them to hedge any economic risks nor do we use other derivative instruments to hedge economic risks stemming from these warrants. We account for warrants in certain private and public (or publicly traded under the provisions of Regulation A) client companies as derivatives when they contain net settlement terms and other qualifying criteria under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. In general, the warrants entitle us to buy a specific number of shares of stock at a specific price within a specific time period. Certain warrants contain contingent provisions, which adjust the underlying number of shares or purchase price upon the occurrence of certain future events. Our warrant agreements typically contain net share settlement provisions, which permit us to receive at exercise a share count equal to the intrinsic value of the warrant divided by the share price (otherwise known as a cashless exercise). These warrants are recorded at fair value and are classified as Investments - warrants on our consolidated balance sheet at the time they are obtained, and remeasured each reporting period. The grant date fair values of warrants received in connection with services performed are deemed to be revenue and recognized upon receipt. Any changes in fair value from the grant date fair value of warrants will be recognized as increases or decreases to investments on our consolidated balance sheets and as a component of operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. In the event of an exercise for shares, the basis or value in the securities is reclassified from Investment - warrants to marketable securities or non-marketable securities, as described below, on the consolidated balance sheet on the latter of the exercise date or corporate action date. The shares in public companies, or companies that trade over-the-counter as allowed by Regulation A, are classified as marketable securities (provided they do not have a significant restriction from sale). The shares in private companies without an active trading market are classified as non-marketable securities.

Table of Contents 
 The fair value of the warrants portfolio is a critical accounting estimate and is reviewed each reporting period. We value our warrants using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model, which incorporates the following significant inputs, in addition to certain adjustments for general lack of liquidity: An underlying asset value, which is estimated based on current information available in valuation reports, including any information regarding subsequent rounds of funding or performance of a company. Stated strike price, which can be adjusted for certain warrants upon the occurrence of subsequent funding rounds or other future events. Price volatility or risk associated with possible changes in the warrant price. The volatility assumption is based on historical price volatility of publicly traded companies within indices or companies similar in nature to the underlying client companies issuing the warrant. The expected remaining life of the warrants in each financial reporting period. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the Treasury yield curve and is calculated based on the risk-free interest rates that correspond closest to the expected remaining life of the warrant on the date of assessment. 
 Investments - Stock In connection with negotiated platform fee agreements, the Company obtains shares of stock in its customers. Our accounting for investment our customers stock depends on several factors, including the level of ownership, and power to control. We base our accounting for such securities on: (i) whether the issuer has made an offering in the current year, (ii) if so, the valuation of the stock in the offering, and (iii) if not, the Company will write down the stock value at a flat 33 rate. As the stock received from customers has no readily determinable fair values and generally represent small amounts of ownership in our customers, the Company accounts for this stock received using the cost method, plus adjustments for gross up, less write downs in accordance with ASC 321-10-35-2. Collectibles The Company records collectibles at cost in accordance with the Company s policy. These long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we believe that we purchase these assets in arms-length transactions at fair value and such transactions are evidence of fair market value in the near term. For collectibles, over time, and as trends change and economic factors affect various markets for which we hold assets, the estimation of certain assets that do not trade in a regular market may be difficult to assess for fair value. Certain assets may be subject to market manipulation or overproduction that could affect the underlying value of like or similar items. The quality of authentication bodies may affect future valuation. If there are limited data points to assess fair value, especially for one-of-a-kind collectibles, we may not identify impairments in a timely manner. Many of the collectibles have value that is in the eye of the beholder. Accordingly, there is significant uncertainty to what these assets would be valued at in subsequent arms-length transactions. Real Estate The company values this interest via the adjusted cost measurement alternative per ASC 321-10-35-2, noting it records the initial measurement at fair value, and in subsequent reporting periods, reports changes in the fair value of such equity investments in net income. As the underlying building does not have a readily available fair market value, the company alternatively measures the investment at cost, minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments through income for observable price changes.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Statement of Cash Flows The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our condensed Statements of Cash Flows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash received (used in) operating activities (4,899,710) (3,170,898) (1,728,812) Net cash received (used in) investing activities 209,837 426,597 (216,760) Net cash received by financing activities 242,476 3,113,638 (2,871,162) Cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,899,710 as compared to 3,170,898 for the same period in 2023. Our net loss attributable to stockholders was 13,828,694 and 10,562,315 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash used by operating activities in Q3 2024 was primarily due to the decrease of deferred revenue by 1,647,907 related to recognizing annual purchases of StartEngine Venture Club as well as the transition of StartEngine Secure purchases from annual purchases recognized over 12 months, to monthly subscription purchases. Additionally, accrued liabilities decreased 1,050,066 as the Company reduced its Ramp card usage as well as a decrease in accounts receivable of 747,687 due to less revenue generated. These decreases were offset by an increase amortization of the SeedInvest acquisition increased 1,922,662 as well as an increase in stock-based compensation by 3,039,619 due to increased headcount. Cash received by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 209,837, as compared to cash received in investing activities of 426,597 in the same period in 2023. As of September 6, 2023, the Company has temporarily suspended it Collectibles program. The cash provided in 2023 primarily relates to collectibles sales. In 2024, the Company received 225,000 for the sale of the partial membership of the building. Cash provided by financing activities was 242,476 and 3,113,638 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The changes primarily relates to the fact that StartEngine s Regulation A offering terminated in November 2023.

 Balance Sheet The following table summarizes our assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 as compared as of December 31, 2023: 

September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Assets Current assets: Cash 8,208,901 12,656,298 Marketable securities 1,856 1,856 Accounts receivable, net of allowance 928,477 193,696 Other current assets 986,288 720,767 Total current assets 10,125,522 13,572,617 Property and equipment, net 125,239 119,723 Investments - warrants 195,487 195,487 Investments - stock 9,069,365 8,623,212 Investments - Private 4,912,225 4,357,083 Investments - Collectibles 2,466,196 2,446,121 Investments - Real Estate 1,911,458 2,136,628 Due from related party 209,360 209,190 Intangible assets 19,320,763 21,892,192 Other assets 33,850 42,138 Total assets 48,369,465 53,594,391 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable 367,321 278,691 Accrued liabilities 5,248,425 4,456,756 Deferred revenue 2,752,682 3,520,150 Total current liabilities 8,368,428 8,255,597 Total liabilities 8,368,428 8,255,597 The Company s current assets decreased by 3,447,095 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in cash in the amount of 4,447,397 driven by increase in expenses related to salaries as well as software purchases. This was offset by an increase in Accounts Receivable by 734,781 as the Company had a large volume of invoices issued at quarter end which were collected in Q4. The Company s long-term assets decreased by 1,777,831 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. This was driven primarily by a 2,571,429 decrease in intangible assets stemming from the SeedInvest IP purchase amortization offset by an increase in investments stock by 494,138 related to equity compensation from issuers as well as an increase in StartEngine Private investments by 555,142 related to purchases. Current liabilities increased by 112,831 which is primarily due to an increase in Accounts Payable by 88,630 for invoices paid by the Company in Q4. Liquidity and Capital Resources We do not currently have any significant loans or available credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s current assets were 10,125,522. To date, our activities have been funded from our revenues, investments from our founders, the previous sale of Series Seed Preferred Shares, Series A Preferred Shares, Series T Preferred Shares, and our Common Stock in our Regulation A and Regulation CF offerings. The Company began a new Regulation A raise for itself on November 1, 2024.

 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including arrangements that would affect the liquidity, capital resources, market risk support, and credit risk support or other benefits. The Company currently has no material commitments for capital expenditures. We believe we have the cash, marketable securities through future equity offerings, other current assets available, revenues, and access to funding that will be sufficient to fund operations until the Company starts generating positive cash flows from normal operations. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 229.10(f)(1). ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact there are resource constraints and management are required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our principal financial officer, has evaluated as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer, who also serves as our Principal Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company discovered certain material weaknesses that resulted in errors in its previously reported financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the Company made certain corrections to previously reported financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, and determined that a restatement based on the corrections made was not necessary; however, it has been noted in the 2023 financial statements. Management continues to evaluate the material weaknesses discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K, has created a remediation plan that it has already begun implementing and continues to finalize that plan's implementation. The Company continues to evaluate its warrant process to ensure the previously disclosed material weaknesses are addressed. Additionally, the Company has implemented a more thorough reconciliation process for accrued liabilities to ensure accuracy at period end. Assurance as to when all remediation efforts will be complete cannot be provided and the material weaknesses cannot be considered remedied until the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Management cannot provide assurances that the measures that have been taken to date, and are continuing to be implemented, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses identified or to avoid potential future material weaknesses.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time we may be involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. Except as described below, the Company is not currently involved in any material litigation or threatened litigation. The Company was recently involved in an arbitration suit with an issuer whose offering was being conducted on the Company platform, StartEngine Capital. In 2021, the Company terminated the issuer s offering and refunded investors for the amount previously raised prior to the termination. The issuer brought a claim against the Company for improperly relying on a recent SEC enforcement against a different crowdfunding portal in determining their course of action against the issuer. The Company and the issuer entered arbitration proceedings in July 2023. The matter was resolved on January 19, 2024 and payment of the settlement was resolved in March 2024. The settlement amount totaled 2.1 million of which the Company paid 200,000 with the remaining 1,900,000 covered by the Company s liability insurance policy. The matter is now considered closed. Item 1A. Risk Factors Risk Factors Related to the Company and its Business We are engaged in an industry that continues to develop and rapidly change, which requires our company to be flexible in executing its business plans. We have not yet generated yearly profits, and may not do so in the near future. StartEngine was formed in 2014 and is still working on fine tuning its business plan to one that will enable it to generate profits on an annual basis and to maintain profitability. Though our core business model of operating our funding portal and broker-dealer services have been receiving revenues for nearly eight years and three years, respectively, we are still evolving aspects of business model, including modifying our revenue models, adding additional products (e.g., StartEngine Secondary and our securitization products), and modifying our current offerings in light of regulatory changes and/or interactions with regulators (see, Item 1. Legal Proceedings ). Accordingly, the Company s operating history may not be indicative of future prospects. Our current and proposed operations are subject to all the business risks associated with businesses in industries that are developing and rapidly changing. These include likely fluctuations in operating results as the Company reacts to developments in its market, manages its growth, and develops new services as well as the entry of competitors into the market. These include likely fluctuations in operating results as the Company reacts to developments in its market, manages its growth, and develops new services as well as the entry of competitors into the market. We will only be able to pay dividends on any shares once our directors determine that we are financially able to do so. Since inception, StartEngine has not generated sufficient revenues to cover operational expenses. There is no assurance that we will be consistently profitable in the next three years or generate sufficient revenues to pay dividends to the holders of our shares. We operate in a regulatory environment that is evolving and uncertain. The regulatory framework for online capital formation or crowdfunding is relatively new. The regulations that govern our operations have been in existence for a limited period. Further, there are constant discussions among legislators and regulators with respect to changing the regulatory environment. New laws and regulations could be adopted in the United States and abroad. Further, existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would impact our operations, including how we communicate and work with investors and the companies that use our platform s services and the types of securities that our clients can offer and sell on our platform. For instance, in prior years, there have been several attempts to modify the current regulatory regime. Some of those suggested reforms could make it easier for anyone to sell securities (without using our services). Any such changes would have a negative impact on our business.

 We operate in a highly regulated industry. We are subject to extensive regulation and failure to comply with such regulation could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, our subsidiary StartEngine Capital LLC is registered as a funding portal; our subsidiary StartEngine Secure LLC is registered as a transfer agent; and our subsidiary StartEngine Primary LLC is registered as a broker-dealer and operates an alternative trading system under the brand StartEngine Secondary . As a funding portal and broker-dealer, we have to comply with stringent regulations, and the operation of our funding portal, broker-dealer and alternative trading system services exposes us to a significant amount of liability. Furthermore, new lines of business may subject us to other regulatory regimes, such those regulating investment advisers, including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, if we fail to remain in compliance with certain exemptions. Regulated entities are frequently subject to examination, constraints on their business, and in some cases fines. We have seen increased regulations in this industry from regulators (both federal and state) and FINRA. In light of this, we expect increased compliance costs as well as potential subjecting us to additional liabilities. In addition, some of the restrictions and rules applicable to our subsidiaries could adversely affect and limit some of our business plans of other parts of our business. We were approved as a broker-dealer in 2019, launched our alternative trading system in 2020, became a carrying broker-dealer in 2021, became an exempt reporting adviser in 2024, and are still in the process of adapting our business model and pricing structure. As a broker-dealer, we not only are subjected to federal and state requirements but also have need to comply with the requirements of FINRA, the self-regulatory organization, that apply to broker-dealers and the regulations that apply to the operation of alternative trading systems. In addition, we have expanded the scope of our operation including launching our alternative trading system in May 2020, and became a carrying broker-dealer at the end of September 2021, which increased our net capital requirements. In 2023, we launched StartEngine Private, which required us to file as an exempt reporting adviser in early 2024 and may require us to become a registered investment adviser in the future. We are still in the process of adapting to these changes, but there have been and will be increased costs, including the need to hire personnel with specific qualifications and pay them in accordance with their experience. We are subjected to periodic examinations and we will be required to change aspects of our business processes and communications in response to the findings of those examinations. Becoming a broker-dealer and/or reporting adviser has and will continue to lead to increases in our compliance costs as well as increases in our exposure to liabilities, including subjecting us to liability for misstatements made by issuers utilizing our services. We may be liable for misstatements made by issuers. Under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, issuers making offerings through our funding portal may be liable for including untrue statements of material facts or for omitting information that could make the statements misleading. This liability may also extend in Regulation Crowdfunding offerings to funding portals, such as our subsidiary. Further, as a broker-dealer, we may be liable for statements by issuers utilizing our services in connection with Regulation A and Regulation D offerings. Even though due diligence defenses may be available; there can be no assurance that if we were sued we would prevail. Further, even if we do succeed, lawsuits are time consuming and expensive, and being a party to such actions may cause us reputational harm that would negatively impact our business. Moreover, even if we are not liable or a party to a lawsuit or enforcement action, some of our clients have been and will be subject to such proceedings. Any involvement we may have, including responding to document production requests, may be time-consuming and expensive as well. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could impair the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business, impair investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our access to the capital markets and cause the price of our common stock to decline and subject us to regulatory penalties. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we maintain internal control over financial reporting that meets applicable standards. We may err in the design or operation of our controls, and all internal control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, there can be no assurance that all control issues have been or will be detected. If we are unable, or are perceived as unable, to produce reliable financial reports due to internal control deficiencies, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and operating results, which could result in a negative market reaction and a decrease in our stock price.

 During preparation for financial reporting related to the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company discovered certain errors in previously reported financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company s management conducted an investigation with the Company s independent auditors. As a result of this investigation, the Company determined that several accounts required correction to be in accordance with US GAAP. In addition, certain footnotes to such financial statements were required as a result of such changes. Accordingly, the Company made certain corrections to previously reported financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. Although management concluded that the adjustments to prior year financial statements are not material, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as defined by Sections 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, was not effective as of December 31, 2023, due to the following identified material weaknesses: - Material asset and liability general ledger accounts were not reconciled to support schedules; - Investment securities were not counted or reconciled to detail records; - Stock and warrants held as investments were not valued using fair value accounting or cost method less adjustments for estimated impairments (stock investments) or using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model (warrant investments) per the Company s stated policies. Also, period end procedures did not include revaluing investments under Company policies and the inclusion of sufficient detail in the support schedules and general ledger accounts to draft financial statement disclosures that properly list investments in the fair value hierarchy, reconcile changes in level 3 investments, and present that variables used in valuing investments; - Financial spreadsheets used to support prepaid assets lacked adequate review and were susceptible to formula and manual input errors; and - Payroll was recorded on a cash basis, rather than an accrual basis, during the fiscal year. 
 Management has included a report on its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, including a description of identified material weaknesses, remediation efforts resulting in changes to internal control over financial reporting, and plans for further remediation in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, available on the SEC s EDGAR database at: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1661779/000155837024012726/stgc-20231231x10ka.htm. If we identify new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we may be late with the filing of our periodic reports, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. As a result of such failures, we could also become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and become subject to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could harm our reputation, financial condition or divert financial and management resources from our core business, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Our compliance is focused on U.S. laws and we have not analyzed foreign laws regarding the participation of non-U.S. residents. Some of the investment opportunities posted on our platform are open to non-U.S. residents. We have not researched all the applicable foreign laws and regulations, and we have not set up our structure to be compliant with foreign laws. It is possible that we may be deemed in violation of those laws, which could result in fines or penalties as well as reputational harm. This may limit our ability in the future to assist companies in accessing money from those investors, and compliance with those laws and regulations may limit our business operations and plans for future expansion. StartEngine s product offerings are relatively new in an industry that is still quickly evolving. The principal securities regulations that work with, Rule 506(c), Regulation A and Regulation Crowdfunding, have only been in effect in their current form since 2013, 2015 and 2016, respectively. StartEngine s ability to continue to penetrate the market remains uncertain as potential issuer companies may choose to use different platforms or providers (including, in the case of Rule 506(c) and Regulation A, using their own online platform), or determine alternative methods of financing. Investors may decide to invest their money elsewhere. Further, our potential market may not be as large, or our industry may not grow as rapidly, as anticipated. With a smaller market than expected, we may have fewer customers. Success will likely be a factor of investing in the development and implementation of marketing campaigns, subsequent adoption by issuer companies as well as investors, and favorable changes in the regulatory environment. Finally, as more competitors enter the market, it will become more difficult to obtain business. We have an evolving business model. Our business model is one of innovation, including continuously working to expand our product lines and services to our clients, such as our expansion into the transfer agent and broker-dealer space as well as our foray into becoming an alternative trading system and acting as an administrative manager for companies. It is unclear whether these services will be successful. Further, we continuously try to offer additional types of services, and we cannot offer any assurance that any of them will be successful. From time to time we may also modify aspects of our business model relating to our service offerings. We cannot offer any assurance that these or any other modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to the business. We may not be able to manage this evolution effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. The Company has also started business via StartEngine Private: The Company provides accredited investors the opportunity to purchase membership interests in funds SE Funds which own shares of venture capital backed, late-stage private companies via its StartEngine Private product offering. As we grow our business, we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we are able to increase the scope of our business offerings, our customer base, the volume of our transactions and grow our business, we will face business risks commonly associated with rapidly growing companies, including the risk that existing management, information systems and financial and internal controls may be inadequate to support our growth. We cannot predict whether we will be able to respond on a timely basis, or at all, to the changing demands that our growth may impose on our existing management and infrastructure. For example, increasing demands on our infrastructure and management could cause any of the following to occur or increase: inadequate internal controls required for a regulated entity; inadequate financial controls needed as we transition to become a reporting company; delays in our ability to handle the volume of customers, including issuers; and failure to properly review and supervise personnel to make sure we are compliant with our duties as regulated entities. This risk is illustrated by the fact that, during preparation for financial reporting related to the year ended December 31, 2023, and based on review from the auditors, the Company discovered certain errors (specifically for warrant and stock valuation, accrued liabilities, and accounts receivable) in its previously reported financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company s management has concluded that, in light of these errors, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 were not effective. To address these material weaknesses, management has devoted, and plans to continue to devote, significant effort and resources to the remediation and improvement of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. While the Company has processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements, management has 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 enhanced these processes in the past year by enhancing the process by which the Company reviews and presents financial statements, and has also invested in accounting software to ensure more accurate reporting. Management s report on internal control over financial reporting, a description of the material weaknesses identified, resulting changes to internal control over financial reporting, and continued plans for remediation can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, under Item 9A Controls and Procedures in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, available on the SEC s EDGAR database at: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1661779/000155837024012726/stgc-20231231x10ka.htm . See also the above risk factor, We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to remediate the material weaknesses, or any other material weaknesses that we identify if the future, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. If we continue to have issues and/or fail to adapt our management, information systems and financial and internal controls to our growth, or if we encounter other unexpected difficulties, our business, financial condition and operating results will suffer. We are primarily reliant on one main type of service. Most of current services are variants on one type of service providing a platform for online capital formation and ancillary services. Our revenues are therefore dependent upon the market for online capital formation. We depend on key personnel and face challenges recruiting needed personnel. Our future success depends on the efforts of a small number of key personnel, including our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Howard Marks, and our compliance, engineering and marketing teams. Expanding our compliance team in response to the growth in our business and the regulatory issues we have faced to date, is essential to our success, and recruiting and training compliance personnel will place demands on financial and management resources. Our software engineer team, as well as our marketing team led by Johanna Cronin, are critical to continually innovate and improve our products while operating in a highly regulated industry. In addition, due the specialized expertise required, we may not be able to recruit the individuals needed for our business needs. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to operate and be innovative. StartEngine and its providers are vulnerable to hackers and cyber attacks. As an internet-based business, we may be vulnerable to hackers who may access the data of our investors and the issuer companies that utilize our platform. Further, any significant disruption in service on the StartEngine platform or in its computer systems could reduce the attractiveness of the StartEngine platform and result in a loss of investors and companies interested in using our platform. Further, we rely on a third-party technology provider to provide some of our back-up technology as well as act as our escrow agent. Any disruptions of services or cyber attacks either on our technology provider or on StartEngine could harm our reputation and materially negatively impact our financial condition and business. StartEngine currently relies on two vendors for escrow services. We currently rely on Bryn Mawr Trust Company and Kingdom Trust to provide escrow services. Any change in these relationships will require us to find another escrow agent and escrow bank. This may cause us delays as well as additional costs in transitioning our technology. We are dependent on general economic conditions. Our business model is dependent on investors investing in the companies presented on our platforms. Investment dollars are disposable income. Our business model is thus dependent on national and international economic conditions. Adverse national and international economic conditions may reduce the future availability of investment dollars, which would negatively impact our revenues and possibly our ability to continue operations. It is not possible to accurately predict the potential adverse impacts on the Company, if any, of current economic conditions on its financial condition, operating results and cash flow.

 We face significant market competition. We facilitate online capital formation. Though this is a relatively new market, we compete against a variety of entrants in the market as well likely new entrants into the market. Some of these follow a regulatory model that is different from ours and might provide them competitive advantages. New entrants could include those that may already have a foothold in the securities industry, including some established broker-dealers. Further, online capital formation is not the only way to address helping start-ups raise capital, and the Company has to compete with a number of other approaches, including traditional venture capital investments, loans and other traditional methods of raising funds and companies conducting crowdfunding raises on their own websites. Additionally, some competitors and future competitors may be better capitalized than us, which would give them a significant advantage in marketing and operations. Moreover, as we continue to expand our offerings, including providing administrative services to issuers, securitizing various asset classes and transfer agent services, we will continue to face headwinds and compete with companies that are more established and/or have more financial resources than we do and/or new entrants bringing disruptive technologies and/or ideas. Finally, the Company faces increasing competition via StartEngine Private which is the Company s new venture in which the Company provides accredited investors the opportunity to purchase membership interests in funds SE Funds which own shares of venture capital backed, late-stage private companies via its StartEngine Private product offering. As new competitors enter the market, acquisition of shares will become more difficult. We may not be able to protect all of our intellectual property. Our profitability may depend in part on our ability to effectively protect our proprietary rights, including obtaining trademarks for our brand names, protecting our products and websites, maintaining the secrecy of our internal workings and preserving our trade secrets, as well as our ability to operate without inadvertently infringing on the proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain future protections for our intellectual property or defend our current trademarks and future trademarks and patents. Further, policing and protecting our intellectual property against unauthorized use by third parties is time-consuming and expensive, and certain countries may not even recognize our intellectual property rights. There can also be no assurance that a third party will not assert infringement claims with respect to our products or technologies. Any litigation for both protecting our intellectual property or defending our use of certain technologies could have material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, regardless of the outcome of such litigation. Our revenues and profits (if any) are subject to fluctuation. It is difficult to accurately forecast our revenues and operating results, and these could fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors. These factors may include adverse changes in: number of investors and amount of investors dollars, the success of world securities markets, general economic conditions, our ability to market our platform to companies and investors, headcount and other operating costs, and general industry and regulatory conditions and requirements. The Company s operating results may fluctuate from year to year due to the factors listed above and others not listed. At times, these fluctuations may be significant and could impact our ability to operate our business. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers and could decrease demand for our services. Risk Factors Related to the Common Stock Voting control is in the hands of a few large stockholders. Voting control is concentrated in the hands of a small number of stockholders. Our CEO and our Chairman of the Board currently hold approximately 40 of our voting shares in aggregate, including shares of our Common Stock and (on an as-converted basis) shares of our Series Seed Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series Seed Preferred Stock; and two other shareholders, SE Agoura 

 42 

Table of Contents 
 Investment LLC and The Lee Miller Trust UA 09/05/2020, own approximately 21 and 11 , respectively, of our voting shares in aggregate. None of SE Agoura Investments LLC, The Lee Miller Trust UA 09/05/2020 or their beneficial owners serve on our Board or as employees of our Company. Those four shareholders (the Controlling Stockholders in aggregate control approximately 70 of our voting shares and approximately 52 of our preferred stock. Other than the Controlling Stockholders, holders of our Common Stock are generally not be able to influence our policies or any other corporate matter, including the election of directors, changes to our Company s governance documents, expanding the employee option pool, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major action requiring stockholder approval. Some of the larger stockholders include, or have the right to designate, executive officers and directors of our Board. These few people and entities make all major decisions regarding the Company. Future fundraising may affect the rights of investors. In order to expand, the Company is likely to raise funds again in the future, either by offerings of securities or through borrowing from banks or other sources. The terms of future capital raising, such as loan agreements, may include covenants that give creditors greater rights over the financial resources of the Company. Holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled to potentially significant liquidation preferences over holders of our Common Stock if we are liquidated, including upon a sale of our company. Holders of our outstanding Preferred Stock have liquidation preferences over holders of Common Stock. This liquidation preference is paid if the amount a holder of Preferred Stock would receive under the liquidation preference is greater than the amount such holder would have received if such holder s shares of Preferred Stock had been converted to Common Stock immediately prior to the liquidation event. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series T Preferred Stock are entitled to liquidation preferences superior to Series Seed Preferred Stock. If a liquidation event, including a sale of our company, were to occur that resulted in a distribution of less than approximately 8 million, the holders of our Preferred Stock could be entitled to all proceeds of cash distributions. There is a limited current market for our Common Stock. Currently, the only marketplace for our Common Stock is and will be our alternative trading system or ATS branded as StartEngine Secondary. To date, we only have limited experience selling our shares on StartEngine Secondary; and trading of our securities will only be available on StartEngine Secondary during limited periods, including periods where we do not have an open offering. To date, there has not been frequent enough trading to establish a market price. The limited volume of trading means that investors should assume that they may not be able to liquidate their investment for some time or to liquidate at their desired price. Further, it is unlikely that they will be able to pledge their shares as collateral. Investors will need to keep records of their investment for tax purposes. As with all investments in securities, investors who sell the Common Stock will probably need to pay tax on the long- or short-term capital gains that you realize if sold at a profit or set any loss against other income. If investors do not have a regular brokerage account, or their regular broker will not hold the Common Stock for them (and many brokers refuse to hold Regulation A securities for their customers) there will be nobody keeping records for investors for tax purposes and they will have to keep their own records, and calculate the gain on any sales of any securities they sell. The price for our Common Stock may be volatile. To date, there has not been enough trading of our shares to establish a market price. The market price of our Common Stock may be highly volatile, if and when any trading begins again in the future and there is sufficient volume of trading to establish a market price, is likely to be continue to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following: We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Our ability to obtain working capital financing. Additions or departures of key personnel.

 Sales of our shares. Our ability to execute the business plan. Operating results that fall below expectations. Regulatory developments. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our securities. As a result, investors may be unable to resell your securities at a desired price. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information. trading and Trading . During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company s officers or directors have entered into a contract, established a plan, or issued instructions that provides for the purchase or sale of any equity securities of the Company intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act.
