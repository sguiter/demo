 Note 1: 
 global businesses - Smart Infrastructure Solutions and Automation Solutions. As Belden continues to advance forward with solutions focused on data infrastructure, we renamed our reportable segments during the three months ended September 29, 2024 

As of and during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, we utilized Level 1 inputs to determine the fair value of cash equivalents. We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023.

As of September 29, 2024, we were party to standby letters of credit, surety bonds, and bank guaranties totaling million, million, and million, respectively. 

In March 2024, the SEC issued a final climate disclosure rule, which requires registrants to disclose climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. The final rule also requires certain disclosures related to risk management and governance over climate-related risks, material climate targets and goals, and material Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. For calendar year companies, the ruling requires certain disclosures in annual reports for the year ending December 31, 2025. On April 4, 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the final rule pending the completion of judicial review of cases pending in the Eighth Circuit. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the final rule on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

 Depending on the terms of an arrangement, we may defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received because we have to satisfy a future performance obligation. Consideration allocated to support services under a support and maintenance contract is typically paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the service. Consideration allocated to professional services is recognized wh en or as the services are performed depending on the terms of the arrangement. Our contract terms for support, maintenance, and professional services typically require payment within one year or less of when the services will be provided. As of September 29, 2024, total deferred revenue was million, and of this amount, million is expected to be recognized within the next twelve months, and the remaining million is long- term and is expected to be recognized over a period greater than twelve months.

million of the deferred revenue balance at September 29, 2024, and of this amount million is expected to be recognized in the next twelve months, and the remaining million is long-term and will be recognized over a period greater than twelve months. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any material contract assets recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 We expense sales commissions as incurred when the duration of the related revenue arrangement is one year or less. We capitalize sales commissions when the original duration of the related revenue arrangement is longer than one year, and we amortize it over the related revenue arrangement period. Capitalized sales commissions as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were not material.

Voleatech is reported within the Automation Solutions segment and is not material to our financial position or results of operations. 
 On June 30, 2024, we acquired Precision Optical Technologies, Inc. Precision with cash on hand for million, net of cash acquired.

 The above purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of individual assets and liabilities becomes available. The preliminary measurement of receivables, inventory, intangible assets, goodwill, deferred income taxes, and other assets and liabilities are subject to change. A change in the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired will change the amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. The preliminary fair value of acquired receivables is million , which is equivalent to its gross contractual amount. A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments we have used in estimating the preliminary fair values assigned to each class of acquired assets and assumed liabilities could materially affect the results of our operations.

 The amortizable intangible assets reflected in the table above were determined by us to have finite lives. The useful life for the developed technology intangible asset was based on the estimated time that the technology provides us with a competitive advantage and thus approximates the period and pattern of consumption of the intangible asset. The useful life for the customer relationship intangible asset was based on our forecasts of estimated sales from recurring customers. The useful life for the trademarks was based on the period of time we expect to continue to go to market using the trademarks. 
 Our consolidated revenues and income before taxes for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 included million and million, respectively, from Precision. For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, income before taxes included million of severance and other restructuring costs, million of amortization of intangible assets, and million of cost of sales related to the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value for Precision.

 The above unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what our results of operations would have been had we completed the acquisition on the date assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. Pro forma adjustments exclude cost savings from any synergies resulting from the acquisition.

Note 4: 
 global businesses: Smart Infrastructure Solutions and Automation Solutions. As Belden continues to advance forward with solutions focused on data infrastructure, we renamed our reportable segments during the three months ended September 29, 2024 from Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Automation Solutions to Smart Infrastructure Solutions and Automation Solutions, respectively. The composition of the segments did not change as a result of these name changes. 
 Each of the global businesses represents a reportable segment. The key measures of segment profit or loss are Segment Revenues and Segment EBITDA. Segment Revenues represent non-affiliate revenues. Segment EBITDA excludes certain items, including depreciation expense; amortization of intangibles; asset impairment; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; adjustments related to acquisitions and divestitures; and other costs. We allocate corporate expenses to the segments for purposes of measuring Segment EBITDA. Corporate expenses are allocated on the basis of each segment s relative EBITDA prior to the allocation. 
 
 Our measure of segment assets does not include cash, goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets, or corporate assets. All goodwill is allocated to reporting units of our segments for purposes of impairment testing. Inter-company revenues between our segments is not material.

million because they are anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of million and million, respectively, because they are anti-dilutive. 
 In addition, for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of million and million, respectively, because the related performance conditions have not been satisfied. Fo r the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of million and million, respectively, because the related performance conditions have not been satisfied. 
 For purposes of calculating basic earnings per share, unvested restricted stock units are not included in the calculation of basic weighted average shares outstanding until all necessary conditions have been satisfied and issuance of the shares underlying the restricted stock units is no longer contingent. Necessary conditions are not satisfied until the vesting date, at which time holders of our restricted stock units receive shares of our common stock. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, unvested restricted stock units are included to the extent that they are dilutive. In determining whether unvested restricted stock units are dilutive, each issuance of restricted stock units is considered separately. Once a restricted stock unit has vested, it is included in the calculation of both basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.

 to years; some of which include extension and termination options. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably certain as of the commencement date of the lease. We have a few short-term operating leases with terms less than twelve months - these leases are not recorded on our balance sheet and the overall rent expense is not material. 
 We also have certain lease contracts that contain both lease and non-lease components. We have elected the practical expedient to account for these components together as a single, combined lease component. T he rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. As a result, we utilize the incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments, which is unique to each leased asset, and is based upon the term of the lease, commencement date of the lease, local currency of the leased asset, and the credit rating of the legal entity leasing the asset. 
 
 Our lease agreements do not contain material residual value guarantees. Our variable lease expense was approximately million and million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the t hree and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively.

 In addition, we guaranteed the lease payments for certain property leases of a former subsidiary with expiration dates extending up to 2035. These lease guarantees were retained by Belden and not transferred to the buyer of the former subsidiary. As of September 29, 2024, the fixed, remaining base rent payments were approximately million. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a liability for expected, future payments of million and million, respectively. The liability is based on certain assumptions, such as receiving a level of sublease income, that we continually reassess on an ongoing basis. We will update the estimated liability balance for changes in assumptions as needed.

 Gain on Sale of Assets 
 During the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, we sold our property in Ontario, Canada as part of a sale and leaseback transaction for million, net of transaction costs and recognized a million pre-tax gain on sale. This gain on sale was excluded from Segment EBITDA for our Automation Solutions segment.

Item 2: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 Belden Inc. (the Company, us, we, or our) is a leading global supplier of network infrastructure and digitization solutions built around 2 global businesses - Smart Infrastructure Solutions and Automation Solutions. As Belden continues to advance forward with solutions focused on data infrastructure, we renamed our two reportable segments during the three months ended September 29, 2024 from Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Automation Solutions to Smart Infrastructure Solutions and Automation Solutions, respectively. The composition of the segments did not change as a result of these name changes. Our mission is to build the foundation for a digital world that makes the digital journey simpler, smarter and secure. 
 Belden is moving beyond connectivity, from what we make to what we make possible through a performance-driven portfolio, forward-thinking expertise and purpose-built solutions. We are aligned with attractive secular growth markets, positioned to provide comprehensive solutions that drive customer outcomes, focused on new product innovation and technology leadership, and committed to sustainable ESG practices. Our current business goals are to: 
 Achieve mid-single-digit annual revenue growth; 
 Deliver incremental Adjusted EBITDA margins between 25 to 30 ; 
 Generate free cash flow margin approaching 10 ; 
 Execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy while maintaining net leverage around 1.5x; and 
 Drive Adjusted EPS to at least 8.00 by 2025 with annual growth of 10 to 12 thereafter. 
 
 Trends and Events 
 The following trends and events during 2024 have had varying effects on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Foreign Currency 
 Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, Indian rupee and Swiss franc. Generally, as the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are negatively impacted as our foreign denominated revenues and earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at a lower rate. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are positively impacted. Approximately 41 of our consolidated revenues during the quarter ended September 29, 2024 were to customers outside of the U.S. 
 In addition to the translation impact described above, currency rate fluctuations have an economic impact on our financial results. As the U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, it results in a relative price increase or decrease for certain of our products that are priced in U.S. dollars in a foreign location. 
 Inflation 
 D uring periods of inflation, if we are unable to raise prices timely and sufficiently to recover our material costs, our earnings could decline. Furthermore, inflation may impact labor, energy, and other costs. We monitor inflation pressures and proactively implement selling price increases or cost control measures as appropriate. 
 Commodity Prices 
 Our operating results can be affected by changes in prices of commodities, primarily copper and compounds, which are components in some of the products we sell. Generally, as the costs of inventory purchases increase due to higher commodity prices, we raise selling prices to customers to cover the increase in costs, resulting in higher sales revenue but a lower gross profit percentage. Conversely, a decrease in commodity prices would result in lower sales revenue but a higher gross profit percentage. Selling prices of our products are affected by many factors, including end market demand, capacity utilization, overall economic conditions, and commodity prices. T here is no exact measure of the effect of changing commodity prices, as there are thousands of transactions in any given quarter, each of which has various factors involved in the individual pricing decisions. Therefore, all references to the effect of copper prices or other commodity prices are estimates. 

-21- 

Channel Inventory 
 Our operating results also can be affected by the levels of Belden products purchased and held as inventory by our channel partners and customers. Our channel partners and customers purchase and hold the products they bought from us in their inventory in order to meet the service and on-time delivery requirements of their customers. Generally, as our channel partners and customers change the level of products they buy from us and hold in their inventory, it impacts our revenues. Comparisons of our results between periods can be impacted by changes in the levels of channel inventory. We use information provided to us by our channel partners and make certain assumptions based on our sales to them to determine the amount of products they bought from us and hold in their inventory. As such, all references to the effect of channel inventory changes are estimates. 
 Market Growth and Market Share 
 The markets in which we operate can generally be characterized as highly competitive and highly fragmented, with many players. We monitor available data regarding market growth, including independent market research reports, publicly available indices, and the financial results of our direct and indirect peer companies, in order to estimate the extent to which our served markets grew or contracted during a particular period. We generally expect that our unit sales volume will increase or decrease consistently with the market growth rate. Our strategic goal is to transition to a solutions provider and target faster growing geographies, applications, and trends within our end markets, in order to achieve growth that is higher than the general market growth rate. To the extent that we exceed the market growth rates, we consider it to be the result of capturing market share. 
 
 Voleatech GmbH Acquisition 
 On September 16, 2024, we acquired Voleatech for 5.0 million 5.6 million), net of cash acquired. The acquisition includes a potential earn-out up to 3.0 million based upon certain targets over three years, which will be accounted for as compensation cost. Voleatech, based in Germany, is known for their VT AIR Next Gen Firewall and expands Belden's Firewall product portfolio and overall planning of security in OT networking. Voleatech is reported within the Automation Solutions segment. See Note 3. 
 Precision Optical Technologies Acquisition 
 On June 30, 2024, we acquired Precision for 289.6 million, net of cash acquired. Precision, based in New York, is a leading supplier of value-added optical transceivers with proprietary software, firmware configurations, and related components. Precision is reported within the Enterprise Solutions segment. See Note 3. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 During the three months ended September 29, 2024 , we repurchased 0.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 20.1 million at an average price per share of 110.84. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024 , we repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 78.0 million at an average price per share of 90.98. See Note 15. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows that are or would be considered material to investors. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 During the nine months ended September 29, 2024: 
 We did not change any of our existing critical accounting policies from those listed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K; 
 No existing accounting policies became critical accounting policies because of an increase in the materiality of associated transactions or changes in the circumstances to which associated judgments and estimates relate; and 
 There were no significant changes in the manner in which critical accounting policies were applied or in which related judgments and estimates were developed.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8.9 million and decreased 9.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2023. The increase in the three months ended September 29, 2024 was primarily attributable to expenses from the operations of companies acquired in 2024. The decrease in the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was primarily attributable to the benefits realized from our productivity initiatives. 
 Research and development expenses decreased 2.2 million and 7.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2023 primarily due to the timing of projects.

 For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, we recognized income tax expense of 11.1 million and 30.5 million representing effective tax rates of 17.1 and 17.9 , respectively. The effective tax rates were primarily impacted by the effect of our foreign operations, including statutory tax rates differences and foreign tax credits. See Note 12. 
 
 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 (In thousands, except percentages) Revenues 654,926 626,807 4.5 1,794,937 1,960,841 (8.5) Adjusted EBITDA 112,530 115,202 (2.3) 296,692 349,832 (15.2) as a percent of revenues 17.2 18.4 16.5 17.8 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA decreased 2.7 million in the three months ended September 29, 2024 from the comparable period of 2023 primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation, partially offset by earnings from acquisitions and benefits realized from our productivity improvement initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 53.1 million in the nine months ended September 29, 2024 from the comparable period of 2023 primarily due to the decline in revenues as discussed above, partially offset by favorable mix and benefits realized from our productivity improvement initiatives. 
 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we provide non-GAAP operating results adjusted for certain items, including: asset impairments; accelerated depreciation expense due to plant consolidation activities; acquisition-related expenses, such as the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value, and transaction costs; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; gains (losses) recognized on the disposal of businesses and assets; amortization of intangible assets; gains (losses) on debt extinguishment; certain gains (losses) from patent settlements; discontinued operations; and other costs. We adjust for the items listed above in all periods presented, unless the impact is clearly immaterial to our financial statements. When we calculate the tax effect of the adjustments, we include all current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with the adjusted measure of pre-tax profitability. 
 We utilize the adjusted results to review our ongoing operations without the effect of these adjustments and for comparison to budgeted operating results. We believe the adjusted results are useful to investors because they help them compare our results to previous periods and provide important insights into underlying trends in the business and how management oversees our business operations on a day-to-day basis. As an example, we adjust for acquisition-related expenses, such as amortization of intangibles and impacts of fair value adjustments because they generally are not related to the acquired business' core operating performance. As an additional example, we exclude the costs of restructuring programs, which can occur from time to time for our current businesses and/or recently acquired businesses. We exclude the costs in calculating adjusted results to allow us and investors to evaluate the performance of the business based upon its expected ongoing operating structure. We believe the adjusted measures, accompanied by the disclosure of the costs of these programs, provides valuable insight. 
 Adjusted results should be considered only in conjunction with results reported according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The following tables reconcile our GAAP results to our non-GAAP financial measures:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Significant factors affecting our cash liquidity include (1) cash from operating activities, (2) disposals of businesses and tangible assets, (3) cash used for acquisitions, restructuring actions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, and senior subordinated note repurchases, and (4) our available credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements. We expect our operating activities to generate cash in 2024 and believe our sources of liquidity are sufficient to fund current working capital requirements, capital expenditures, contributions to our retirement plans, share repurchases, senior subordinated note repurchases, quarterly dividend payments, and our short-term operating strategies. However, we may require external financing in the event we complete a significant acquisition. Our ability to continue to fund our future needs from business operations could be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: economic conditions worldwide, customer demand, competitive market forces, customer acceptance of our product mix, and commodities pricing. 
 The following table is derived from our Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statements: 
 Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities 177,357 159,993 Investing activities (366,244) (145,497) Financing activities (84,815) (167,403) Effects of currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (360) (3,798) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents (274,062) (156,705) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 597,044 687,676 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 322,982 530,971 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 177.4 million in the nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to 160.0 million in the year ago period. Despite a decrease in net income, operating cash flows increased 17.4 million compared to the prior year due to a 52.0 million improvement in operating assets and liabilities that was primarily driven by favorable changes in receivables. During the first nine months of 2023, receivables were a use of cash of 48.9 million compared to a source of cash of 3.2 million in 2024.

 Our cash and cash equivalents balance was 323.0 million as of September 29, 2024. Of the total cash balance, 200.5 million was held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. Substantially all of the foreign cash and cash equivalents are readily convertible into U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies. Our strategic plan does not require the repatriation of foreign cash in order to fund our operations in the U.S., and it is our current intention to permanently reinvest the foreign cash outside of the U.S. If we were to repatriate the foreign cash to the U.S., we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes in accordance with applicable U.S. tax rules and regulations as a result of the repatriation. 
 Our outstanding debt obligations as of September 29, 2024 consisted of 1,228.0 million of senior subordinated notes. Additional discussion regarding our various borrowing arrangements is included in Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
