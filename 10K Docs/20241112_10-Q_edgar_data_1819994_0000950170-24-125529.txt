The Company has not observed a significant deterioration in credit quality of these securities, which are highly rated with moderate to low credit risk. Declines in value are largely attributable to current global economic conditions. The securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments, and the fair values are expected to recover as they approach maturity. The Company does not intend to sell the securities, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities, before the respective recoveries of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not recognized an allowance for credit losses on any marketable securities in an unrealized loss position.

aggregate principal amount of its Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the Notes ). The Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture (the Indenture ), dated as of February 6, 2024, between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the Trustee ). The Notes are the Company s senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with the Company s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes in right of payment; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company s existing and future secured indebtedness, including borrowings under its equipment financing agreement, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company s subsidiaries. The Notes accrue interest at a rate of per annum, in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2024 . The Notes mature on , unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Before November 1, 2028, noteholders have the right to convert their Notes only during the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock exceeds of the conversion price for each of at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, (ii) during the five consecutive business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price per principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such trading day, (iii) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions specified in the Indenture or (iv) if the Company calls such Notes for redemption. From and after November 1, 2028, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company s election. The initial conversion rate is shares of common stock per principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time. As of September 30, 2024, the Notes were not convertible at the option of the holder. As of September 30, 2024, there was outstanding under the Notes, before unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of . As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate under the Notes was . Capped Call Transactions In connection with the pricing of the Notes, on February 1, 2024 and February 2, 2024, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the Capped Call Transactions with certain financial institutions. Collectively, the Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the Notes. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was . The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset the potential dilution to the Company s common stock upon exercise of the Notes and/or the Company s election to offset the cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Notes upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market price per share of the Company s common stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions (which initially corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions), with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions have an initial cap price of per share of the Company s common stock, which represents a premium of 100 over the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock on February 1, 2024. The Capped Call Transactions do not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as they are indexed to the Company s stock. The premiums paid for the Capped Call Transactions have been included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital within shareholders equity.

The tax provisions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were computed using the estimated effective tax rates projected to be applicable for domestic and international taxable jurisdictions for the full year as adjusted for discrete items arising during each quarter. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to a full valuation allowance against our US deferred tax assets, as well as the impact of discrete items that may occur in any given year but which are not consistent from year-to-year. The Company is not currently under examination by the IRS, state and local, or foreign tax authorities. Due to its net operating loss carryforwards, the Company remains subject to examination for U.S. federal and state jurisdictions for all years beginning with the year ended March 31, 2016. The Company s foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to examination within four years from the end of the tax year during which the tax return was filed. In April 2024, the Company effectively settled its uncertain tax position relating to its New Zealand subsidiary and recognized a benefit of as part of the income tax provision booked during the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

operating segments, Launch Services and Space Systems. Each of these operating segments represents a reportable segment. Launch Services provides launch and launch related services to customers on a dedicated mission or ride share basis. Space Systems is comprised of spacecraft engineering and design services, spacecraft components, spacecraft manufacturing and on-orbit mission operations. Although many of the Company s contracts with customers contain elements of Space Systems and Launch Services, each reporting segment is managed separately to better align with customer s needs and the Company s growth plans. The chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on gross profit. For contracts with customers that contain both Space Systems and Launch Services elements, revenues for each reporting segment are generally allocated based upon the overall costs incurred for each of the reporting segments in comparison to total overall costs of the contract.

 Overview 
 Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success. We deliver reliable launch services, spacecraft design services, spacecraft components, spacecraft manufacturing and other spacecraft and on-orbit management solutions that make it faster, easier and more affordable to access space. 
 While our business has historically been centered on the development of small-class launch vehicles and the related sale of launch services, we are currently innovating in the areas of medium-class launch vehicles and launch services, space systems design and manufacturing, on-orbit management solutions, and space data applications. Each of these initiatives addresses a critical component of the end-to-end solution and our value proposition for the space economy: 
 Launch Services is the design, manufacture, and launch of orbital rockets to deploy payloads to various Earth orbits and interplanetary destinations. 

Space Systems is the design and manufacture of spacecraft components and spacecraft program management services, space data applications and mission operations. 

Electron is our orbital small launch vehicle that was designed from the ground up to accommodate a high launch rate business model to meet the growing and dynamic needs of our customers for small launch services. Since its maiden launch in 2017, Electron has become the leading small spacecraft launch vehicle delivering 197 spacecraft to orbit for government and commercial customers across 49 successful missions through September 30, 2024. In 2023, Electron was the second most frequently orbital launched rocket by companies operating in the United States and maintained Rocket Lab as the fourth most frequent orbital launcher globally. Our launch services program has seen us develop many industry-leading innovations, including 3D printed electric turbo-pump rocket engines, fully carbon composite first stage fuel tanks, a private orbital launch complex, a rocket stage that can be configured to convert into a highly capable spacecraft on orbit, and the potential ability to successfully recover a stage from space, providing a path to reusability. 
 In March 2021, we announced plans to develop our reusable-ready medium-capacity Neutron launch vehicle which will increase the payload capacity of our space launch vehicles to approximately 15,000 kg for expendable launches to low Earth orbit and lighter payloads for reusable configurations and into higher orbits. Neutron will be tailored for commercial and U.S. government constellation launches and ultimately configurable for and capable of human space flight, enabling us to provide crew and cargo resupply to the International Space Station. Neutron will also provide a dedicated service to orbit for larger civil, defense and commercial payloads that need a high level of schedule control and high-flight cadence. Neutron is expected to have the capability of launching nearly all of the spacecraft configurations that we expect to be launched through 2029 and we expect to be able to leverage Electron s flight heritage across various vehicle subsystems designs, launch complexes and ground station infrastructure.

Our space systems initiatives are supported by the design and manufacture of our family of advanced configurable spacecraft along with a range of components, software and services for spacecraft, including reaction wheels, star trackers, radios, separation systems, solar solutions, command and control spacecraft software, high voltage space grade battery solutions, and additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub-system functions. We entered this market with our acquisition of leading spacecraft components manufacturer Sinclair Interplanetary, and have since expanded our market participation with the acquisitions of Planetary Systems Corporation, SolAero Holdings, Inc. and aerospace software firm Advanced Solutions, Inc. Each of these strategic acquisitions brought incremental vertically-integrated capabilities for our own family of advanced configurable spacecraft and also enabled Rocket Lab to deliver high-volume manufacturing of critical spacecraft components and software solutions at scale prices to the broader spacecraft merchant market. The family of advanced configurable spacecraft, which are configurable for a range of low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit and interplanetary missions enable us to offer an end-to-end mission solution encompassing launch, full spacecraft manufacturing, ground services and mission operations to provide customers with streamlined access to orbit with Rocket Lab as a single mission partner. 
 Recent Developments 
 Neutron Update 
 We have made significant progress across Neutron s structures and infrastructure, including the completion of construction on the rocket s Assembly, Integration, and Test (A.I.T.) facility in Virginia. We have doubled engine testing cadence for Archimedes over the quarter at Rocket Lab s engine test site in Mississippi, alongside strong production execution at our Engine Development Complex in California which included multiple engines manufactured, assembled, and shipped for engine testing. We signed a launch service agreement for two dedicated Neutron launches with a confidential commercial satellite constellation customer. 
 Key Metrics and Select Financial Data 
 We monitor the following key financial and operational metrics that assist us in evaluating our business, measuring our performance, identifying trends and making strategic decisions. 
 Launch Vehicle Build-Rate and Launch Cadence 
 We built approximately eight launch vehicles 2021, approximately 12 launch vehicles in 2022 and approximately 11 launch vehicles in 2023. We built approximately 10 launch vehicles through the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We launched six vehicles in 2021, nine vehicles in 2022 and ten vehicles in 2023. We have launched 11 vehicles through the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and launched 12 vehicles through November 12, 2024. Growth rates between launches and total launch service revenue are not perfectly correlated because our total revenue is affected by other variables, such as the revenue per launch, which can vary considerably based on factors such as unique orbit and insertion requirements, payload handling needs, launch location, time sensitivity of mission completion and other factors. We believe that the growth in our build rate and launch rate is a positive indicator of our ability to scale our launch operations. 
 Revenue Growth 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 We generated 104.8 million and 67.7 million in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a year-on-year increase in revenue of approximately 55 . This year-on-year increase primarily resulted from space systems revenue growth of 37.5 million, offset by a decrease in launch revenue of 0.4 million due to a lower revenue per launch. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 We generated 303.8 million and 184.6 million in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a year-on-year increase in revenue of approximately 65 . This year-on-year increase primarily resulted from space systems revenue growth of 99.6 million and launch revenue growth of 19.6 million due to a higher launch cadence with 11 launch missions completed in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus nine launch missions completed in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and higher revenue value per launch.

Table of Contents 

Revenue and Cost Value Per Launch 
 Revenue and cost value per launch represents the average revenue and cost per launch contract attributable to launches that occurred during a period. Revenue and cost value per launch can be a useful metric to provide insight into general competitiveness and price sensitivity in the marketplace. Revenue and cost value per launch can vary considerably, based on factors such as unique orbit and insertion requirements, payload handling needs, launch location, time sensitivity of mission completion and other factors, and as such may not provide absolute clarity with regards to pricing and competitive dynamics in the marketplace. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our revenue value per launch was 7.0 million and 7.1 million, respectively. Meanwhile, cost per launch for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5.0 million and 5.2 million, respectively. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our revenue value per launch was 7.5 million and 7.0 million, respectively. Meanwhile, cost per launch was 5.5 million and 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, excluding a 2.1 million benefit from non-recurring employee retention credit to Launch Services cost of revenue and a 4.1 million benefit from non-recurring reversal of provision made for contract losses that were credited to Launch Services cost of revenue in the in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Backlog 
 Backlog represents future revenues that we would recognize in connection with the completion of all contracts and purchase orders that have been entered into by our customers but have not yet been fulfilled, excluding any customer options for future products or services that have not yet been exercised. Contracts for launch services and spacecraft builds typically include termination rights that may be exercised by customers upon advanced notice and payment of a specified termination fee. Our backlog increased from 1,046.1 million as of December 31, 2023 to 1,047.6 million as of September 30, 2024, of which 326.4 million is related to Launch Services and 721.2 million is related to Space Systems. The increase was primarily a result of bookings during the period, partially offset by recognizing revenue on contracts during the period. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Ability to sell additional launch services, space systems service and spacecraft components to new and existing customers 
 Our results will be impacted by our ability to sell our launch services, space systems services, and spacecraft components to new and existing customers. We have successfully launched Electron 49 times delivering 197 spacecraft to orbit, including one suborbital launch, through September 30, 2024. We have flight hardware and spacecraft that have flown on over 1,700 missions, including legacy missions enabled by Sinclair Interplanetary (acquired April 2020), Advanced Space Solutions, Inc (acquired October 2021), Planetary Space Corporation (acquired November 2021) and SolAero Technologies (acquired January 2022). Our growth opportunity is dependent on our ability to expand our addressable launch services market with larger volumetric and higher mass payload capabilities of our in-development medium-capacity Neutron launch vehicle, which will address large commercial and government constellation launch opportunities. Our growth opportunity is also dependent on our ability to win spacecraft constellation missions and expand our portfolio of strategic spacecraft components. Our ability to sell additional products to existing customers is a key part of our success, as follow-on purchases indicate customer satisfaction and decrease the likelihood of competitive substitution. To sell additional products and services to new and existing customers, we will need to continue to invest significant resources in our products and services. 
 Ability to improve profit margins and scale our business 
 We intend to continue to invest in initiatives to improve our operating leverage and significantly ramp production. We believe continued reduction in costs and an increase in production volumes will enable the cost of launch vehicles to decline and improve our gross margins. Our ability to achieve our production-efficiency objectives could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors including, among other things, lower-than-expected facility utilization rates, manufacturing and production cost overruns, increased purchased material costs and unexpected supply-chain quality issues or interruptions. 
 Government expenditures and private enterprise investment into the space economy 
 Government expenditures and private enterprise investment has fueled the growth in our target markets. We expect the continued availability of government expenditures and private investment for our customers to help fund purchases of our products and services will remain. This is an important factor in our company s growth prospects.

Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Our revenues are derived from a combination of long-term fixed price contracts for launch services and spacecraft builds, and purchase order based spacecraft components sales. Revenues from long-term contracts are recognized using either the point-in-time or over-time method of revenue recognition. Point-in-time revenue recognition results in cash payments being initially accrued to the balance sheet as deferred revenue as contractual milestones are accomplished and then recognized as revenue once the final contractual obligation is completed. Over-time revenue recognition is based on an input measure of progress based on costs incurred compared to estimated total costs at completion. Each project has a contractual revenue value and an estimated cost. The over-time revenue is recognized based on the percentage of the total project cost that has been realized. 
 Estimating future revenues and associated costs and profit is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment, including management s assumptions regarding our future operational performance as well as general economic conditions. Frequently, the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and, as such, revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be affected to the extent that estimated costs to complete are revised, delivery schedules are delayed, performance-based milestones are not achieved or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded. Accordingly, our recorded revenues and operating profit from period to period can fluctuate significantly depending on when the point-in-time or over-time contractual obligations are achieved. In the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract, the total amount of such loss is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues consists primarily of direct material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, other personnel-related expenses, which include salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, reserves for estimated warranty costs, freight expense and depreciation expense. Cost of revenues also includes charges to write-down the carrying value of inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value, including on-hand inventory that is either obsolete or in excess of forecasted demand. We expect our cost of revenues to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we sell more launch services and space systems solutions. As we grow into our current capacity and execute on cost-reduction initiatives, we expect our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue to decrease over time. 
 Because direct labor costs and manufacturing overhead comprise a significant portion of cost of revenues, increasing our production rate resulting in greater absorption of these costs is our most critical cost reduction initiative. Increasing our production rate is a cross-functional effort involving sales and business development, manufacturing, engineering, supply chain and finance. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Research and Development, net 
 Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, design software licenses, validation and testing expense, prototype parts and materials, facilities and depreciation expense. We intend to continue to make significant investments in developing new products and enhancing existing products, including but not limited to our medium capacity Neutron launch vehicle, Electron s first stage recovery, and family of advanced configurable spacecraft features and capabilities, as well as expanding our portfolio of spacecraft components and subsystems. Research and development expense will be variable relative to the number of products that are in development, validation or testing. However, we expect it to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our sales, marketing, supply chain, finance, legal, human resources and administrative personnel, as well as the costs of customer service, information technology, risk management and related insurance, travel, allocated overhead and other marketing, communications and administrative expenses. We also expect to further invest in our corporate infrastructure and incur additional expenses associated with operating as a public company, including increased legal and accounting costs and compliance costs. As a result, we expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods but decline as a percentage of total revenue over time. 
 Interest Income (Expense), Net 
 Interest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest expense incurred on debt and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments balances and marketable securities. 
 Gain (Loss) on Foreign Exchange 
 Gain (loss) on foreign exchange relates to currency fluctuations that generate foreign exchange gains or losses on invoices denominated in currencies other than the United States U.S. Dollar.

We recorded income tax expense of 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and income tax expense of 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was (1.9) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (3.4) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to a full valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets, as well as the impact of discrete items that may occur in any given year but which are not consistent from year-to-year.

The effective tax rate was (0.1) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (2.0) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since inception, we have funded our operations with proceeds from sales of our capital stock, convertible senior notes, term note debt, research and development grant proceeds, and cash flows from the sale of our products and services. As of September 30, 2024, we had 292.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and 211.2 million of marketable securities. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are for investment in new products and technologies, the expansion of existing manufacturing facilities, working capital, debt service, acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies and general corporate needs. 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and payments from customers will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months, although we may choose to take advantage of opportunistic capital raising or refinancing transactions at any time. We will continue to invest in increasing production and expanding our product offerings through acquisitions. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

Material Cash Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding 416.2 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under our convertible senior notes and equipment financing agreement, of which 11.8 million was scheduled to become due in the following twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, our total minimum lease payments was 103.0 million, of which 10.6 million is due in the following twelve months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations at September 30, 2024, refer to Note 11, Loan Agreements, and Note 14, Leases, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 45.5 million. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our launch cadence, traction in the market with our space systems offerings, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the introduction of new and enhanced products, the continuing market adoption of our products, the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces and the number of acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies we pursue, if any. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued product innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations and financial condition. 
 Additionally, we expect our capital and operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with ongoing activities as we: 
 increase our investment in marketing, sales and distribution infrastructure for our existing and future products and services; 

develop additional new products and enhancements to existing products; 

obtain, maintain and improve our operational, financial and management performance; 

hire additional personnel; 

obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and 

continue to operate as a public company. 

Indebtedness 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was 355.0 million outstanding under our 4.250 Convertible Senior Notes due 2029, before unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of 10.1 million. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, there was 61.2 million outstanding under the Trinity Loan Agreement, before unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of 2.5 million.

Table of Contents 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 80.4 million was primarily driven by 46.6 million of net cash used in investing activities related to purchases and maturities of marketable securities and 45.5 million of capital equipment and infrastructure investments, partially offset by 11.8 million of proceeds on disposal of assets, net primarily related to the sale of a helicopter. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 256.5 million was primarily related to 355.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, partially offset by 48.9 million of repayments on Trinity Loan Agreement, 43.2 million purchase of capped calls related to the issuance of convertible senior notes and 12.2 million of debt issuance costs. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our audited financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and inflation. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of each of our subsidiaries is either its local currency or the U.S. dollar. The assets and liabilities of each of our subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date and operations accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the relevant period. Increases or decreases in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies may positively or negatively affect revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accounted for as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity. Gains or losses due to transactions in foreign currencies are reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations under the line item Loss on foreign exchange. Materially all of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars and we have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency risk to date, although we may choose to do so in the future. As such, a 10 or greater move in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar could have a material impact on our financial results and position. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 292.5 million, comprised primarily of operating accounts and money market instruments and 211.2 million invested in marketable securities, comprised of commercial paper, corporate debt securities, bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury bills and notes and asset backed securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures it could diminish our margin thereby limiting our profits, especially if we are not able to fully offset such higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Our management believes that there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.

II. Equity Retainers 

All grants of equity retainer awards to Outside Directors pursuant to this Policy will be automatic and nondiscretionary and will be made in accordance with the following provisions: 
 (a) Value . For purposes of this Policy, Value means with respect to (i) any award of stock options the grant date fair value of the option (i.e., Black-Scholes Value) determined in accordance with the reasonable assumptions and methodologies employed by the Company for calculating the fair value of options under ASC Topic 718; and (ii) any award of restricted stock and restricted stock units the product 

of (A) the average closing market price on the NASDAQ (or such other market on which the Company s Common Stock is then principally listed) of one share of the Company s Common Stock over the trailing 30-trading day period ending on the last day immediately prior to the grant date and (B) the aggregate number of shares pursuant to such award. 

a. Sale Event Acceleration . In the event of a Sale Event (as defined in the Company s 2021 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, the 2021 Plan )), the equity retainer awards granted to Outside Directors pursuant to this Policy shall become 100 vested and exercisable. 

b. Initial Grant . Upon initial election to the Board of Directors, each new Outside Director will receive an initial, one-time grant of restricted stock units (the Initial Grant with a Value of 360,000, that vests in three equal annual installments over three years; provided, however, that all vesting ceases if the Outside Director resigns from our Board of Directors or otherwise ceases to serve as a director, unless the Board of Directors determines that the circumstances warrant continuation or acceleration of vesting. This Initial Grant applies to Outside Directors who are first elected to the Board of Directors effective as of or subsequent to the Effective Date. 

c. Annual Grant . On the date of the Company s Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each Outside Director who will continue as a member of the Board of Directors following such Annual Meeting of Stockholders will receive a grant of restricted stock units on the date of such Annual Meeting (the Annual Grant with a Value of 180,000, that vests in full on the earlier of (i) the one-year anniversary of the grant date or (ii) the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders; provided, however, that all vesting ceases if the Outside Director resigns from our Board of Directors or otherwise ceases to serve as a director, unless the Board of Directors determines that the circumstances warrant continuation or acceleration of vesting. If a new Outside Director joins our Board of Directors on a date other than the date of the Company s Annual Meeting of Stockholders, then upon initial election or appointment to the Board of Directors, such Outside Director will be granted a pro-rata portion of the Annual Grant based on the number of days between such Outside Director s election or appointment (as applicable) and the first June 15 th following such election or appointment (as applicable) as the numerator and 365 as the denominator (the Pro-Rated Annual Grant ). The Pro-Rated Annual Grant will vest in full on the earlier of (i) the one-year anniversary of the grant date of the Annual Grant for the other Outside Directors, and (ii) the date of the Company s next Annual Meeting of Stockholders; provided, however, that all vesting ceases if the Outside Director resigns from our Board of Directors or otherwise ceases to serve as a director, unless the Board of Directors determines that the circumstances warrant continuation or acceleration of vesting. 

III. Expenses 

The Company will reimburse all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Outside Directors in attending meetings of the Board of Directors or any Committee thereof. 
 IV. Maximum Annual Compensation 

The aggregate amount of compensation, including both equity compensation and cash compensation, paid to any Outside Director in a calendar year period shall not exceed (i) 1,000,000 in the first calendar year an individual becomes an Outside Director and (ii) 650,000 in any other year (or in each case, such other limits as may be set forth in Section 3(b) of the 2021 Plan or any similar provision of a successor plan). For this purpose, the amount of equity compensation paid in a calendar year shall be determined based on the grant date fair value thereof, as determined in accordance with ASC Topic 718 or its successor provision, but excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions.
