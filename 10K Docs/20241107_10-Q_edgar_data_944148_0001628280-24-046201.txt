 million, including million recorded as contingent consideration. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded million in total revenue from those acquisitions. None of the acquisitions are considered material, individually or in the aggregate. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed the sale of CBIZ KA Consulting Services, LLC, which was a component of our National Practice segment. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a gain of million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The gain was recorded in "Gain on sale of operations, net" on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Proceeds from the sale were classified as cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 Range of effective rates - 
 - 
 
 We had approximately million of available funds under the 2022 credit facility at September 30, 2024, net of outstanding letters of credit of million. Available funds under the 2022 credit facility are based on a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as defined in the 2022 credit facility, and are reduced by letters of credit, other indebtedness and outstanding borrowings under the 2022 credit facility. Under the 2022 credit facility, loans are charged an interest rate consisting of a base rate or term SOFR rate plus an applicable margin, letters of credit are charged based on the same applicable margin, and a commitment fee is charged on the unused portion of the 2022 credit facility. 
 The 2022 credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants customary for facilities of this type, including restrictions on indebtedness, liens or other encumbrances, making certain payments, investments, or to sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of assets, or to merge or consolidate with an unaffiliated entity. The 2022 credit facility also limits our ability to make dividend payments. Historically, we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock. Our Board of Directors has discretion over the payment and level of dividends on common stock, subject to the limitations of the 2022 credit facility and applicable law. The 2022 credit facility contains a provision that, in the event of a defined change in control, the 2022 credit facility may be terminated and all amounts outstanding may become due and payable. In addition, the 2022 credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain requirements with respect to (i) a total leverage ratio and (ii) minimum interest coverage ratio which may limit our ability to borrow up to the total commitment amount. As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all covenants. 
 Refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion on the 2022 credit facility. 
 The 2022 credit facility was amended and restated on November 1, 2024 in connection with the closing of the Transaction (as defined below). Refer to Note 12, Subsequent Events, for more information. 
 Other Line of Credit - We have an unsecured million line of credit by and among CBIZ Benefits and Insurance, Inc. and Huntington National Bank. We utilize this line to support our short-term funding requirements of payroll client fund obligations due to the investment of client funds, rather than liquidating client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. The line of credit did t have a balance outstanding at September 30, 2024. On August 1, 2024, we renewed the line of credit and it will now terminate on July 31, 2025.

 million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, we provide license bonds to various state agencies to meet certain licensing requirements. The amount of license bonds outstanding was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Legal Proceedings - On December 19, 2016, CBIZ Operations, Inc. ("CBIZ Operations") was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Zotec Partners, LLC Zotec in the Marion County Indiana Superior Court. After various amendments, the lawsuit asserted claims under Indiana law for securities, statutory and common law fraud or deception, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, and vicarious liability against CBIZ Operations and a former employee of CBIZ MMP in connection with the sale of the CBIZ MMP medical billing practice to Zotec. The plaintiff claimed that CBIZ Operations had a duty to disclose the fact, unknown to employees of CBIZ Operations at the time of the transaction, that the former employee had a financial arrangement with a Zotec vendor at the time CBIZ Operations sold CBIZ MMP to Zotec. The plaintiff sought damages of up to million out of the million transaction price. Trial was held in October 2021. The jury found in favor of CBIZ on all fraud, contract and other claims before it. On November 14, 2022, the trial court ruled in favor of CBIZ and against Zotec s claim for statutory securities fraud. The court also ruled in favor of CBIZ on its counterclaim for indemnification under contract. The trial court conducted a hearing on December 12, 2023, to consider evidence regarding the amount of damages owed by Zotec to CBIZ on the counterclaim. On March 12, 2024, the court awarded CBIZ million on its counterclaim. On April 10, 2024, Zotec filed a notice of appeal. 
 On November 10, 2023, CBIZ was named as a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts by an individual claiming to be an employee of a CBIZ client whose personally identifiable information PII was compromised and stolen during a cyberattack CBIZ experienced on or about May 31, 2023. As a result of this incident, hackers were able to access and download certain files from CBIZ s MOVEit Transfer server. The lawsuit alleges that CBIZ and Progress Software Corporation, the owner of MOVEit Transfer, failed to adequately secure and safeguard the individual s, and similarly situated employees of CBIZ s clients, PII from unauthorized access. The lawsuit seeks various remedies, including actual, compensatory, and punitive damages, along with injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys fees. 
 On December 8, 2023, CBIZ was named as a defendant in a second putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts by an individual making similar claims and seeking similar remedies as in the first lawsuit regarding the cyberattack CBIZ experienced on or about May 31, 2023. 
 Both cases were transferred into a multidistrict litigation, styled as In Re: MOVEit Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, pending in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the MDL ). To date, the MDL has over cases against over different defendants, all with claims arising out of the cyberbreach by hackers of Progress Software Corporation s MOVEit Transfer software. The cases in the MDL, including the cases against CBIZ, are in their earliest stages, with a stay in place until the MDL Court issues a scheduling order. Due to the early stage of litigation, the Company is not able to determine or predict the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits nor reasonably provide an estimate or range of the possible outcome or losses, if any. 
 In addition to the items disclosed above, the Company is, from time to time, subject to claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. We cannot predict the outcome of all such matters or estimate the possible loss, if any. Although the proceedings are subject to uncertainties in the litigation process and the ultimate disposition of these proceedings is not presently determinable, we intend to vigorously defend these matters. 
 Refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion on the Company's commitments and contingencies.

 At September 30, 2024, unrealized losses on the securities were not material and have not been recognized as a credit loss because the bonds are investment grade quality and management is not required or does not intend to sell prior to an expected recovery in value.

 Interest Rate Swaps - We utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure associated with our floating-rate debt under the 2022 credit facility, or the forecasted acquisition of such liability. We do not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion on our interest rate swaps.

The 2019 Plan, which expires in 2029, permits the grant of various forms of stock-based awards. A maximum of million stock options, restricted stock or other stock-based compensation awards may be granted. The terms and vesting schedules for the stock-based awards vary by type and date of grant. Shares subject to award under the 2019 Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or treasury shares.

Performance Share Units PSUs PSUs are earned based on our financial performance over a contractual term of and the associated expense is recognized over that period based on the fair value of the award. A cliff vesting schedule of the PSUs is dependent upon the Company s performance relative to pre-established goals based on an earnings per share target (weighted and total growth in revenue (weighted ). The fair value of PSUs is calculated using the market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. For performance achieved above specified levels, the recipient may earn additional shares of stock, not to exceed of the number of PSUs initially granted.

 practice groups: Financial Services, Benefits and Insurance Services, and National Practices. The business units have been aggregated based on the following factors: similarity of the products and services provided to clients; similarity of the regulatory environment in which they operate; and similarity of economic conditions affecting long-term performance. The business units are managed along these segment lines. A general description of services provided by each practice group is provided in the table below. 
 Financial Services Benefits and Insurance Services National Practices Accounting and Tax Employee Benefits Consulting Information Technology Managed Networking and Hardware Services Financial Advisory Payroll / Human Capital Management Healthcare Consulting Valuation Property and Casualty Insurance Risk and Advisory Services Retirement and Investment Services Government Healthcare Consulting 
 Corporate and Other - Included in Corporate and Other are operating expenses that are not directly allocated to the individual business units. These expenses primarily consist of certain health care costs, gains or losses attributable to assets held in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, stock-based compensation, consolidation and integration charges, certain professional fees, certain advertising costs, and other various expenses. 
 Accounting policies of the practice groups are the same as those described in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Upon consolidation, intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated, thus inter-segment revenue is not included in the measure of profit or loss for the practice groups. Performance of the practice groups is evaluated on income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) excluding those costs listed above, which are reported in Corporate and Other . 
 Segment information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented below. We do not manage our assets on a segment basis, therefore segment assets are not presented below.

Subsequent Events to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the Transaction and related 2024 Credit Facilities. 
 Strategic Use of Capital 
 Our overall business objective continues to focus on making strategic acquisitions that allow us to strengthen our presence in existing markets, expand into high growth industries, and broaden our services to our existing offerings. As a result of the Transaction and related 2024 Credit Facilities as described in Note 12. Subsequent Events to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we have 1,465.5 million outstanding debt under the 2024 Credit Facilities as of November 1, 2024. To achieve our business objective of making strategic acquisitions, our current priority for use of capital is to maximize cash flow to pay down debt, which will allow us more liquidity to make strategic acquisitions in the future. In addition, we believe that repurchasing shares of our common stock can be a prudent use of our financial resources, and that investing in our stock is an attractive use of capital and an efficient means to provide value to our stockholders. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed three acquisitions for 22.5 million in cash. We also repurchased 0.2 million shares of our common stock for tax withholding purposes at a total cost of approximately 11.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the CBIZ Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 5.0 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program ), which may be suspended or discontinued at any time and expires on March 31, 2025. The shares may be purchased in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, and pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. Privately negotiated transactions may include purchases from our employees, officers and directors, in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC rules. CBIZ management will determine the timing and amount of the purchases based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors.

 Interest Expense 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our average debt balance and weighted average effective interest rate were 350.7 million and 5.37 , respectively, compared to 398.3 million and 5.53 for the same period of 2023. The decrease in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by a lower interest rates and lower average debt balance. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our average debt balance and interest rate were 362.1 million and 5.40 , respectively, compared to 368.2 million and 5.16 for the same period of 2023. The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by a higher weighted average effective interest rate.

 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income (expense), net includes a net gain of 8.4 million associated with the deferred compensation plan. For the same period in 2023, other income (expense), net includes a net loss of 3.5 million associated with the deferred compensation plan. Excluding the impact of the deferred compensation plan from other income (expense), net would result in a decrease of 8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to higher expense related to contingent consideration fair value adjustments of 5.1 million, as a result of assuming 5.3 million contingent purchase price liabilities from CBIZ CPAs P.C., and higher other expenses of 1.7 million. In addition, we recorded 1.4 million of gains from the sale of certain assets in 2023 which did not recur in 2024. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income (expense), net includes a net gain of 20.6 million associated with the deferred compensation plan. For the same period in 2023, other income (expense), net includes a net gain of 7.7 million associated with the deferred compensation plan. Excluding the impact of the deferred compensation plan from the other income (expense), net would result in a decrease of 8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to higher expense related to contingent consideration fair value adjustments of 4.3 million, as a result of assuming 5.3 million contingent purchase price liabilities from CBIZ CPAs P.C, and higher other expenses of 2.1 million. In addition, we recorded 1.6 million of gains from the sale of certain assets in 2023 which did not recur in 2024.

The increase in the effective tax rate for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a lower tax benefit recognized related to stock-based compensation expense during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, which adversely affected the effective tax rate as related to pre-tax income. 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 28.1 , compared to an effective tax rate of 27.9 for the same period in 2023. The slight increase in the effective tax rate for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a lower tax benefit recognized related to stock-based compensation expense during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, which adversely affected the effective tax rate as related to pre-tax income. This increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the tax effect of lower non-deductible expenses and lower state expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.

LIQUIDITY 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operating activities and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements while our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. We historically maintain low cash levels and apply any available cash to pay down the outstanding debt balance. 
 We historically experience a use of cash to fund working capital requirements during the first quarter of each fiscal year. This is primarily due to the seasonal accounting and tax services period under the Financial Services practice group, as well as payment of accrued employees' incentives programs. Upon completion of the seasonal accounting and tax services period, cash provided by operations during the remaining three quarters of the fiscal year substantially exceeds the use of cash in the first quarter of the fiscal year. 
 Accounts receivable balances increase in response to the first nine months' revenue generated by the Financial Services practice group. A significant amount of this revenue is billed and collected in subsequent quarters. Days sales outstanding DSO represent accounts receivable and unbilled revenue (net of realization adjustments) at the end of the period, divided by trailing twelve months' daily revenue. We provide DSO data because such data is commonly used as a performance measure by analysts and investors and as a measure of our ability to collect on receivables in a timely manner. Trailing-twelve-month DSO, including the impact of acquisitions, was 97 days and 96 days at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. DSO at December 31, 2023 was 78 days. 
 The following table presents selected cash flow information. For additional details, refer to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 The balances in funds held for clients and client fund obligations can fluctuate with the timing of cash receipts and the related cash payments. The nature of these accounts is further described in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Financing Activities - Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 85.2 million and primarily consisted of 24.9 million in net proceeds from the credit facility, partially offset by 11.4 million cash used in share repurchases for tax withholding purposes, a 47.6 million net decrease in client fund obligations and 50.9 million in contingent consideration payments related to prior acquisitions. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 18.4 million and primarily consisted of 66.2 million in share repurchases, a 49.6 million net decrease in client fund obligations and 40.1 million in contingent consideration payments related to prior acquisitions. The use of cash was partially offset by 129.0 million in net proceeds from the credit facility and 8.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Credit Facility - At September 30, 2024, we had 337.3 million outstanding under the 2022 credit facility as well as 3.2 million outstanding letters of credit. Available funds under the 2022 credit facility, based on the terms of the commitment, were approximately 252.0 million at September 30, 2024. The weighted average interest rate under the 2022 credit facility was 5.40 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.16 for the same period in 2023. The 2022 credit facility allows for the allocation of funds for future strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the 2022 credit facility. As a result of the Transaction and related 2024 Credit Facilities as described in Note 12. Subsequent Events, to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we have 1,465.5 million of outstanding debt under the 2024 Credit Facilities as of November 1, 2024. 
 Debt Covenant Compliance - Under the 2022 credit facility, we are required to meet certain financial covenants with respect to (i) total leverage ratio and (ii) minimum interest charge coverage ratio. We are in compliance with our financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. Our ability to service our debt and to fund future strategic initiatives will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future. For further discussion regarding our 2022 credit facility and debt as well as our 2024 Credit Facilities, refer to Note 4, Debt and Financing Arrangements and Note 12, Subsequent Events, respectively, to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Use of Capital - Our overall business objective continues to focus on making strategic acquisitions that allow us to strengthen our presence in existing markets, expand into high growth industries, and broaden our services to our existing offerings. As a result of the Transaction and related 2024 Credit Facilities as described in Note 12. Subsequent Events to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we have 1,465.5 million of outstanding debt under the 2024 Credit Facilities as of November 1, 2024. To achieve our business objective of making strategic acquisitions, our current priority for use of capital is to maximize cash flow to pay down debt, which will allow us more liquidity to make strategic acquisitions in the future. In addition, we also have the financing flexibility and the capacity to actively repurchase shares of our common stock. We believe that repurchasing shares of our common stock can be a prudent use of our financial resources, and that investing in our stock is an attractive use of capital and an efficient means to provide value to our stockholders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed three acquisitions for 22.5 million in cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also repurchased 0.2 million shares of our common stock for tax withholding purposes at a total cost of approximately 11.4 million. 
 Cash Requirements - Cash requirements for the remainder of 2024 and beyond will include the repayment of outstanding debt and related interest, making strategic acquisitions, funding seasonal working capital requirements, making contingent purchase price payments for previous acquisitions, share repurchases, income tax payments, and capital expenditures. We believe that cash provided by operations, as well as available funds under our 2024 Credit Facilities will be sufficient to meet cash requirements for the remainder of 2024 and beyond. Refer to Note 12. Subsequent Events to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the 2024 Credit Facilities. 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 We maintain administrative service agreements with independent CPA firms (as described more fully under Item 1. Business Financial Services and in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023), which qualify as variable interest entities.

 We have various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Generally, these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, related to matters such as title to assets sold and certain tax matters. Payment by us under such indemnification clauses is generally conditioned upon the other party making a claim. Such claims are typically subject to challenge by us and to dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount and, in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement. Historically, we have not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2024, we are not aware of any material obligations arising under indemnification agreements that would require payment. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As more information becomes known, these estimates and assumptions could change, which would have an impact on actual results that may differ materially from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions. We have not made any changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 Refer to Note 2, New Accounting Pronouncements, to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including without limitation, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" regarding our financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives for future performance are forward-looking statements. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements are commonly identified by the use of such terms and phrases as "intends", "believes", "estimates", "expects", "projects", "anticipates", "foreseeable future", "seeks", and words or phrases of similar import in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated services, sales efforts, expenses, and financial results. 
 From time to time, we may also provide oral or written forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in any other public statements that we make, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to 
 40 

differ materially from those projected. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: we may be more sensitive to revenue fluctuations than other companies, which could result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock; payments on accounts receivable may be slower than expected, or amounts due on receivables or notes may not be fully collectible; we are dependent on the services of our executive officers, other key employees, producers and service personnel, the loss of whom may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; restrictions imposed by independence requirements and conflict of interest rules may limit our ability to provide services to clients of the attest firms with which we have contractual relationships and the ability of such attest firms to provide attestation services to our clients; our goodwill and intangible assets could become impaired, which could lead to material non-cash charges against earnings; certain liabilities resulting from acquisitions are estimated and could lead to a material non-cash impact on earnings; governmental regulations and interpretations are subject to changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our clients, our business, our business services operations, our business models, or our revenue; changes in the United States healthcare or public health environment, including new healthcare legislation or regulations, may adversely affect the revenue and margins in our or our clients businesses; we are subject to risks relating to processing customer transactions for our payroll and other transaction processing businesses; cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors or clients could materially and adversely affect our business; we are subject to risk as it relates to software that we license from third parties; we could be held liable for errors and omissions, contract claims, or other litigation judgments or expenses; the future issuance of additional shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock; our principal stockholders may have substantial control over our operations; we require a significant amount of cash for interest payments on our debt and to expand our business as planned; terms of our credit facility may adversely affect our ability to run our business and/or reduce stockholder returns; our failure to satisfy covenants in our debt instruments could cause a default under those instruments; we are reliant on information processing systems and any failure of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; we may not be able to acquire and finance additional businesses which may limit our ability to pursue our business strategy; the business services industry is competitive and fragmented; if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted; and there is volatility in our stock price. 
 
 With respect to the recently completed Transaction as described in Note 12. Subsequent Events to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the possibility that anticipated benefits and/or synergies of the Transaction will not be achieved in a timely manner or at all; the possibility that the costs of the Transaction and/or liabilities assumed will be more significant than anticipated; the possibility that integration will prove more costly and/or time consuming than anticipated; the possibility that the Transaction could disrupt ongoing plans and operations of the parties or their respective relationships with clients, other business partners and employees; the effects of the increased leverage of the Company following the Transaction; and the other risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Such forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. 
 Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. A more detailed description of risk factors may be found in our periodic filings with the SEC, including in Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our filings with the SEC, such as quarterly, periodic and annual reports.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our floating rate debt under the 2022 credit facility exposes us to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are different. A change in the Federal Funds Rate, or the reference rate set by Bank of America, N.A., would have affected the rate at which we could borrow funds under the 2022 credit facility. The balance outstanding under our 2022 credit facility at September 30, 2024 was 337.3 million, of which 187.3 million was subject to rate risk. If market rates were to increase or decrease 100 basis points from the levels at September 30, 2024, interest expense would have increased or decreased approximately 1.9 million annually. 
 We do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments. We periodically use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure. The interest rate swaps effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk, primarily through converting portions of our floating rate debt under the 2022 credit facility to a fixed rate basis. These agreements involve the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have the following interest rate swaps outstanding (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 Notional Amount Fixed Rate Expiration Interest rate swap 50,000 0.834 4/14/2025 Interest rate swap 30,000 1.186 12/14/2026 Interest rate swap 20,000 2.450 8/14/2027 Interest rate swap 25,000 3.669 4/14/2028 Interest rate swap 25,000 4.488 10/14/2028 
 Management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as we deem appropriate under certain operating and market conditions. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 As described within Note 12. Subsequent Events to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, on November 1, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Credit Facilities. The 2024 Credit Facilities amended and restated the 2022 credit facility. The interest rate under the 2024 Credit Facilities is a floating rate based on certain base rate or Term SOFR, plus an applicable spread. As of November 1, 2024, outstanding debt under the 2024 Credit Facilities was 1,465.5 million, of which 1,315.5 million is subject to rate risk. If market rates were to increase or decrease 100 basis points from the levels at November 1, 2024, interest expense would increase or decrease approximately 13.2 million annually. 
 In connection with the services provided by our payroll operations, funds collected from our clients accounts in advance are segregated and may be invested in short-term investments, such as corporate and municipal bonds. In accordance with our investment policy, all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of the initial acquisition, and are classified as available-for-sale securities. At each respective balance sheet date, these investments are adjusted to fair value with fair value adjustments being recorded to other comprehensive income or loss and reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the respective period. If an investment is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to credit loss, then the adjustment is recorded to "Other income (expense), net" in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Refer to Note 6, Financial Instruments, and Note 7, Fair Value Measurements, to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these investments and the related fair value assessments. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure Controls as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation Controls Evaluation was done with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ). Disclosure Controls are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the 
 42 

time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure Controls include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Although our Disclosure Controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of a control system are met. Further, any control system reflects limitations on resources, and the benefits of a control system must be considered relative to its costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within CBIZ have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of a control. A design of a control system is also based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. 
 Conclusions 
 Our Disclosure Controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and, based upon the Controls Evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, CBIZ s Disclosure Controls were effective at that reasonable assurance level. 
 (b) Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 43 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. As of 
 the date hereof, we are not engaged in any legal proceedings that are reasonably expected, individually or in the 
 aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash 
 flows. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC. These risks could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of CBIZ. 
 
 On November 1, 2024, we completed the Transaction. Refer to Note 12. Subsequent Events to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the Transaction. Risks related to the Transaction follow: 
 
 If we are unable to successfully integrate Marcum, or integration efforts prove disruptive, it could result in the combined business failing to meet our expectations. 
 
 The success of the Transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate Marcum with our current operations. The Transaction is our largest acquisition to date, and the size and complexity of the Transaction creates inherent challenges, risk and uncertainty in the integration process. If we are not able to successfully integrate Marcum, operationally and culturally, the anticipated benefits of the Transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer or cost more to realize than expected.The process of integrating Marcum s operations will likely require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. Our management team may also encounter unforeseen difficulties in managing the integration process. It is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of our and Marcum s ongoing businesses, the loss of client relationships or difficulties in generating new client relationships and inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices and policies that could adversely impact our operations. Disruption and distraction caused by this process could also prevent us from pursuing, or otherwise divert resources and attention from, otherwise attractive business and growth opportunities. Any of these risks may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the price of our common stock. 
 
 Our business could be adversely affected if Marcum does not perform to our expectations or we underestimate the liabilities we are assuming. 
 
 Even if we successfully integrate Marcum, there can be no assurance we will realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction. While our management and advisors have spent significant time and resources evaluating Marcum s business, it is difficult to predict future performance and the benefits from a Transaction involving large and complex organizations. In addition, we assumed Marcum s liabilities other than specified excluded liabilities that were not contributed by Marcum to MAG prior to closing of the Transaction. It is possible that we may have underestimated the liabilities that we assumed, or we may have assumed liabilities that are unknown or that we did not foresee and were not excluded from Marcum s contribution to MAG. If the liabilities that we assumed are more than we anticipate, or insurance coverage is not available to us in sufficient amounts to cover the liabilities that we assumed, it could increase the effective cost of the Transaction and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. The performance and benefits that we ultimately achieve may be influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transaction, at all or in the expected timeframe, or become responsible for costs or liabilities that we did not foresee, our business could be adversely affected. 
 
 The price of our common stock could be adversely impacted if we do not perform to expectations following the Transaction. 
 
 The market price of our common stock could be adversely affected if we do not perform to our own and investor expectations. We are a larger and more complex organization following the closing of the Transaction, and in order to maintain and earn the trust of our investors, we will have to effectively execute on our strategy to integrate 
 44 

Marcum and achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Transaction. This process will take time, and it will be necessary to effectively communicate our progress and strategy to investors over the short and long term. If we experience challenges or delays in this process, it could adversely impact, or cause volatility in, our operating results. It could also result in a decrease in investor confidence and have an adverse impact to the market price of our common stock or cause increased volatility in trading prices. 
 
 The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. 
 
 Our success following the Transaction will depend on the continued contributions of officers, business unit leaders and other key employees. The integration process may result in the loss of key personnel, whether such loss is through resignation or other causes, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel. In order to obtain the benefits of the Transaction, the Company will need to retain the services of Marcum partners and other key personnel. The Transaction will result in changes for these partners and other key personnel, in terms of compensation structure and form (subject to compliance with the Merger Agreement), organizational and leadership structure, culture and otherwise, as they have moved from working in a private organization to a publicly traded company, and it is uncertain how they will react. In addition, the Transaction could result in disruption and changes for the Company s existing key personnel, and it is also uncertain how they will react. Although most of our key personnel are subject to non-compete and other restrictive covenants and Marcum partners entered into restrictive covenant agreements in connection with the Transaction, in light of the competitive employment environment and risks related to the enforcement of restrictive covenants, we cannot assure you that these agreements will be effective and that we will be able to retain the services of such personnel. The loss of such personnel or an inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel may impair the Company s ability to achieve its financial goals or realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. Further, the replacement of any key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the Company s business objectives. 
 
 Our increased leverage following the Transaction may adversely impact our business. 
 
 We incurred substantial indebtedness to fund the Transaction. As a result, our debt to EBITDA ratio has increased significantly following the closing. If we do not perform in accordance with our expectations following the Transaction, we could be unable to reduce our debt to EBITDA ratio to consistent with our prior levels, whether in anticipated timeframes or at all. We could also face difficulties servicing and complying with the covenants and other terms of our debt instruments. The 2024 Credit Facilities provide for floating-rate indebtedness, so increases in interest rates could result in higher interest expense and/or additional hedging costs. In addition, if we are unable to reduce our levels of indebtedness following the Transaction, we may be unable to pursue business and growth opportunities and uses of capital that would be beneficial to us and our shareholders, such as additional acquisitions and share repurchases. 
 
 The significant number of shares issuable as the stock consideration in the Transaction may adversely impact our stock price. 
 
 There can be no assurance the Transaction will be accretive to earnings per share, at all or in expected timeframes. If we do not perform as expected following the Transaction or costs or assumed liabilities are greater than anticipated, our earnings per share could be adversely impacted by the significant increase in outstanding shares. In addition, although restrictions on resale under applicable securities laws will prevent sales in at least the six months following closing, Marcum partners are not subject to contractual limitations on their ability to resell shares once they receive them. While the delivery of the stock consideration in installments over approximately four years may mitigate the potential for sales of a large volume at any particular time, persistent selling, or the perception of persistent selling, could adversely impact the market price of our common stock. 
 
 Our current shareholders have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the Transaction. 
 
 Once fully issued, the stock consideration issuable in the Transaction is expected to constitute approximately 22 of our outstanding shares of common stock, without giving effect to any subsequent issuances, repurchases or other changes in the number of shares outstanding. As a result, our current shareholders will own a meaningfully smaller percentage of the Company than they currently own, and collectively will have less ability to influence the Company s management and policies. In addition, to the extent that Marcum partners retain a significant portion of the shares that are issued to them, they will collectively have significant influence on any matters requiring a vote of shareholders. 
 45 

Restrictions imposed by independence requirements and conflict of interest rules, as well as the nature and terms of our current Administrative Services Agreements, limit our ability to provide services to clients of the attest firms with which we have contractual relationships and the ability of such attest firms to provide attestation services to our clients. 
 
 Restrictions imposed by independence requirements and state accountancy laws and regulations preclude us from rendering audit and other attest services (other than internal audit services). As such, we and our subsidiaries maintain joint-referral relationships and Administrative Services Agreements with independent licensed CPA firms under which audit and other attest services may be provided to our clients by such CPA firms. The CPA firms are owned by licensed CPAs, a vast majority of whom are employed by us. 
 
 As a condition to closing the Transaction, CBIZ CPAs completed the Attest Purchase by purchasing from Marcum substantially all of Marcum s attest business assets, subject to certain exclusions. We expect the Attest Purchase to significantly increase the attest services covered under our existing Administrative Services Agreement with CBIZ CPAs and the revenues that we generate through this agreement. 
 
 Under the Administrative Services Agreement with CBIZ CPAs and our other Administrative Services Agreements, we provide a range of services to the CPA firms, including: functions such as professional staff, office management, bookkeeping, and accounting; preparing marketing and promotion materials; and providing office space, computer equipment, systems support and administrative support. Services are performed in exchange for a fee. Fees earned by us under the Administrative Services Agreements are recorded as revenue in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. In the event that accounts receivable and unbilled work in process become uncollectible by the CPA firms, the service fee due to us is reduced on a proportional basis. 
 
 The Administrative Services Agreements do not provide us with control over the associated CPA firms, which are independent parties. As such, the continuation of the associations with these CPA firms is subject to the terms and lengths of the various Administrative Services Agreements, and the ability of the parties to work cooperatively together. Our ability to provide non-attest services to clients that receive attest services from the associated CPA firms may be contingent on our ability to extend the Administrative Services Agreements as they expire, and the ability and willingness of the CPA firms to retain their attest clients. Further, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction will depend in significant part upon maintaining our relationship with CBIZ CPAs and its ability to integrate Marcum s attest business assets in an efficient and effective manner. Similar to risks associated with our ability to integrate Marcum s non-attest business, the size and complexity of the Transaction creates inherent challenges, risk and uncertainty in the integration process. Any inability by CBIZ CPAs to successfully and timely integrate Marcum s attest business assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations following the closing of the Transaction. 
 
 With respect to CPA firm clients that are required to file audited financial statements with the SEC, the SEC staff has informed us that, under Regulation S-X, it considers the Company to be an associated entity of the CPA firms with which CBIZ has contractual relationships. Accordingly, we do not hold any financial interest in, nor do we enter into any business relationship with, an SEC-reporting attest client that the CPA firm performing an audit could not maintain. Further, we do not provide any non-audit services to an SEC-reporting attest client that the CPA firm performing an audit could not provide under the auditor independence restrictions set out in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules and requirements of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB ). As a result, the acquisition and integration of Marcum s attest assets into CBIZ CPAs and Marcum s non-attest assets into the Company will result in conflicts and independence impairments that will likely require certain services to be terminated and result in a loss of revenue. Although we conducted due diligence on conflicts and independence issues in connection with the Transaction, it is possible that the conflicts and independence issues, and potential loss of revenue, could be more significant than anticipated. However, applicable professional standards generally permit us to provide additional services to privately held companies, in addition to those services which may be provided to SEC-reporting attest clients of a CPA firm. We and the CPA firms have implemented policies and procedures designed to enable us to maintain independence and freedom from conflicts of interest in accordance with applicable standards. In the past, given the pre-existing limits set by us on our relationships with SEC-reporting attest clients of associated CPA firms, and the limited number and size of such clients, the imposition of independence restrictions under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, SEC rules or interpretations, and PCAOB standards did not materially affect our revenues. Following the Attest Purchase, there will be a significant increase in the number of SEC-reporting attest clients of CBIZ CPAs (from very few or none in recent periods to well over 100 following the Attest Purchase). As a result, it may be more challenging to manage conflicts of interest and independence restrictions and these challenges could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations. SEC staff has further informed us that independence rules that apply to clients that receive 
 46 

attest services under SEC and PCAOB standards from such CPA firms would prohibit such clients from holding any shares of our common stock. 
 
 There can be no assurance that following the policies and procedures implemented by us and the CPA firms will enable us and the CPA firms to avoid circumstances that would cause us and them to lack independence from an SEC-reporting attest client; nor can there be any assurance that state, United States Government Accountability Office or United States Department of Labor accountancy authorities will not impose additional restrictions on the profession. To the extent that the CPA firms for whom we provide staffing, administrative and other services are affected, we may experience a decline in fee revenue from these businesses as well as expenses related to addressing independence concerns. To date, revenues derived from providing services in connection with attestation engagements of the attest firms performed for SEC-reporting clients have not been material, but we expect they will significantly increase following the Attest Purchase. 
 
 Recent SEC and PCAOB sanctions against Marcum may adversely impact our performance and reputation. 
 
 On June 21, 2023, Marcum agreed to pay an aggregate of 13.0 million as a result of charges by the SEC and the PCAOB. In addition, Marcum was censured and required to adhere to several undertakings, including retaining an independent consultant to review and evaluate its audit, review and quality control policies and procedures. The charges against Marcum related to quality control failures and violations of audit standards in connection with audit work for a large number of special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) clients, as well as other clients. Following the Attest Purchase, Marcum s attest business is subject to CBIZ CPAs system of quality control, and there is uncertainty as to how CBIZ CPAs quality control procedures will impact the ability of Marcum s attest business to profitably retain and grow client business over time. In addition, CBIZ CPAs system of quality control procedures could be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny following the Transaction as a result of the events described above. Whether as a result of any such scrutiny or for other reasons, it is possible CBIZ CPAs could determine additional investments in control procedures are appropriate following the Attest Purchase. Any additional investments or the implementation of any additional control procedures could impact our profitability going forward. There also may be adverse reputational impacts as a result of the SEC and PCAOB order that may adversely affect CBIZ CPAs and us following the closing of the Transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 
 If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting following the Transaction, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may decline. 
 
 We and Marcum have maintained separate internal control over financial reporting with different financial reporting processes and systems. In addition, Marcum was a private company and not subject to the enhanced public company requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting. Marcum has identified certain material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions, post-retirement obligations, financial statement footnote disclosures and cost assessments and the corresponding impact on revenue on a project level basis. As Marcum s internal control over financial reporting has not previously been subject to audit, additional material weaknesses could be discovered. Marcum also has not had to prepare quarterly financial information in the format that will be required for the Company s public filings and in the timeframe in which it will be necessary. We will have to integrate Marcum s internal controls and financial reporting processes and systems with ours. We may encounter difficulties and unanticipated issues in combining our respective accounting systems due to the complexity of the financial reporting processes and because Marcum has not previously been subject to public company financial reporting obligations. We may also identify errors or misstatements that could require adjustments or restatements to financial statements. If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting following the Transaction, we may be unable to produce financial statements within required time periods or fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may decline. 
 
 Cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving our or Marcum s computer systems or the systems of one or more of our or Marcum s vendors could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 
 Our systems, and Marcum s systems, like others in the industries we serve, are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, and are subject to potential disruption caused by such activities. Companies like ours are subject to frequent attacks on their systems. Such attacks may have various goals, from seeking confidential information to causing operational disruption. We have experienced cyber-attacks and other security breaches in the past. Although to date such activities have not resulted in material disruptions to our operations or materially affected our business strategy, 
 47 

results of operations or financial condition, no assurance can be provided that we will not experience material disruptions or suffer material adverse effects in the future. Any future significant violations of our data security privacy could result in the loss of business, litigation, regulatory investigations, penalties, ongoing expenses related to notifications and client credit monitoring and support, and other expenses, any of which could damage our reputation and adversely affect the growth of our business. 
 
 Additional events or cyberattacks in the future could exacerbate the foregoing risks and create additional challenges to maintaining client relationships and our reputation. While we have deployed resources that are responsible for maintaining what we consider to be appropriate levels of cybersecurity, and while we utilize third-party technology products and services to help identify threats and protect our information technology systems and infrastructure against security breaches and cyber-incidents, we do not believe such resources or products and services can provide absolute protection against all potential risks and incidents. In addition, while we have reviewed Marcum s cybersecurity measures as part of our consideration of the Transaction, they also cannot provide absolute protection against all potential risks and incidents and it is possible that we could be exposed to vulnerabilities following the Transaction that we did not foresee or anticipate. 
 
 We make risk-based decisions on the measures to implement, and our responsive and precautionary measures may not be adequate or effective to prevent, identify, or mitigate attacks by hackers, foreign governments, or other actors or breaches caused by employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions and will need to continue to do so following the Transaction. We and Marcum are also dependent on security measures that some of our third-party vendors and customers are taking to protect their own systems and infrastructures. In the past, our third-party vendors have experienced issues with their security measures. Although to date such issues have not resulted in material disruptions or materially affected our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, no assurance can be provided that we will not experience material disruptions or suffer material adverse effects in the future if our third-party vendors do not maintain adequate security measures, do not require their subcontractors to maintain adequate security measures, do not perform as anticipated and in accordance with contractual requirements, or become targets of cyber-attacks. 
 
 Managing cybersecurity risks is a challenging process, and combining our systems and processes with those of Marcum could create additional complexity and challenges. If we fail to integrate our and Marcum s security measures in a timely and effective manner, it could potentially result in a temporary increase in cybersecurity risks during the transition period. 
 
 Rapid technological changes could significantly impact our competitive position, client relationships and operating results and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction. 
 
 The professional business services industry has been and continues to be impacted by significant technological changes and innovation, enabling companies to offer services competitive with ours. Those technological changes may (i) reduce demand for our services, (ii) enable the development of competitive products or services, or (iii) enable our current customers to reduce or bypass the use of our services. Additionally, rapid changes in artificial intelligence, block chain-based technology, automation and related innovations are increasing the competitiveness landscape. 
 
 The ability of our combined organization following the Transaction to invest in technology and data analytics in order to serve our client base was a key rationale for the Transaction. While this provides opportunities, it also can expose us to elevated risk if we do not effectively manage these investments, which may be significant. If we are not successful in anticipating or responding to technological changes, we may not generate a return on these investments and demand for our services could be further reduced by advanced technologies being deployed by our competitors. In some cases, we depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support. If these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us, our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected. 
 
 Our goodwill and other intangible assets could become impaired, which could lead to material non-cash charges against earnings and a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 1.03 billion in the aggregate. On a pro forma basis after the Transaction, this value significantly increased. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, and ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, we assess these assets, including client lists, to determine if there is any indication of impairment. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transaction, significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, adverse changes 
 48 

resulting from new governmental regulations, negative impact on client list due to loss of customers, impact on client list due to declining revenue of existing customers, divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments. Any impairment of goodwill or intangible assets would result in a non-cash charge against current earnings, which could lead to a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Given the significant increase in goodwill and intangible assets following the Transaction, the potential magnitude of any such impairment could also be significant. 
 
 The Transaction could exacerbate the other existing business risk that we face. 
 
 Following the Transaction, we will continue to be subject to the other business risks that we currently face as described in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, it may be more challenging to effectively manage and mitigate these risks as a result of the significant resources that will be dedicated to the integration of the Transaction. Disruptions or distractions as a result these efforts could make the risks we already face more likely to be realized, or subject us to additional risks. As part of our integration efforts, we will also need to ensure that our risk management policies and controls are appropriate for a larger and more complex organization. This will be an inherently challenging process that will take time, and we could be subject to elevated risks if we are not successful or are delayed in implementing effective policies and controls. In addition, the expanded size and complexity of our business after the Transaction, as well as changes to the nature of our business, could increase the magnitude of some of the risks we face. There are substantial uncertainties associated with all of the foregoing, and any these risks may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock pr ice. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 (a) Recent sales of unregistered securities 
 In connection with the Transaction, we agreed to issu e 14.3 million shares of our common stock to Marcum s partners in installments over approximately four years, commencing on January 2, 2025. Refer to Note 12. Subsequent Events to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the Transaction. The offering and sale of the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the Transaction was made in reliance on the exemption from registration requirements provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 117 thousand shares of our common stock were issued as payment for contingent consideration for previous acquisitions. The foregoing shares were issued in transactions not involving a public offering in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The persons to whom the shares were issued had access to full information about the Company and represented that they acquired the shares for their own account and not for the purpose of distribution. The certificates for the shares contain a restrictive legend advising that the shares may not be offered for sale, sold, or otherwise transferred without having first been registered under the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act. 
 (b) Issuer purchases of equity securities 
 On February 7, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the continuation of the Share Repurchase Program, which has been renewed annually for the past twenty years. It was effective beginning March 31, 2024, from which the amount of shares to be purchased was reset to five million, and expires one year from the effective date. This authorization allows us to purchase shares of our common stock (i) in the open market, (ii) in privately negotiated transactions, or (iii) under Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. 
 Privately negotiated transactions may include purchases from our employees, officers and directors, in accordance with SEC rules. Rule 10b5-1 trading plans allow for repurchases during periods when we would not normally be active in the trading market due to regulatory restrictions. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time. 
 Shares repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program during the three months ended September 30, 2024 (reported on a trade-date basis) are summarized in the table below (amounts in thousands, except per share data). Average price paid per share includes fees and commissions.
