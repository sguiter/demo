 Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included loans with a specific allowance and certain bank property held for sale, both measured based on the fair value of collateral. The unobservable inputs were the additional adjustments applied by management to the appraised values to reflect such factors as non-current appraisals and revisions to estimated time to sell. These adjustments are determined based on qualitative judgments made by management on a case-by-case basis and are not observable inputs, although they are used in the determination of fair value. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loans held-for-sale classified as Level 3 represented loans held-for-sale in less liquid markets requiring significant management assumptions when determining fair value.

 Unrealized losses on investment securities resulted from changes in market interest rates. The Corporation s portfolio is comprised of securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises. As such, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investments. Further, the Corporation does not intend to sell the investments, and it is not more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell the investments before recovery of amortized costs. No allowance for credit losses was recorded on securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Interest receivable on investment securities totaled million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023 and was included in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The investment securities portfolio included floating-rate securities with a fair value of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 There were sales, calls or write-downs of investment securities available-for-sale during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023.

 NOTE 5 - 
 Retail Bank Wealth Management Total 
 The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter 2024. The Corporation first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Qualitative factors included economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance and performance of the Corporation's stock, among other events and circumstances. At the conclusion of the qualitative assessment in third quarter 2024, the Corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 
 Analyzing goodwill includes consideration of various factors that involve a degree of uncertainty, including the impacts of monetary policy actions, foreign developments, and unanticipated legislative or regulatory changes, among other factors that could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible equity ratio or liquidity position.

 billion of interest rate swaps used in cash flow hedges of certain BSBY-indexed loans and reclassify amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings. For each de-designated swap, settlement of interest payments and changes in fair value were recorded as risk management hedging losses within noninterest income instead of net interest income until re-designation. As all impacted swaps were re-designated as of April 1, 2024, there was no impact to noninterest income for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. A total of million in net losses were included in noninterest income as a result of the de-designations, consisting of million during the first quarter 2024 and million during the fourth quarter 2023. 
 Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flows that continued to be probable of occurring were amortized out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings, which resulted in pre-tax losses of million recorded in interest and fees on loans during both three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. Additionally, the fair value of swaps at re-designation date were accreted back into accumulated other comprehensive income, resulting in benefits of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The amortization of probable cash flows and fair value accretion resulted in net losses of million and million included in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 BSBY cessation and the related de-designation and re-designation of interest rate swaps led to net increases in accumulated other comprehensive income of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 For more information on accumulated net losses on cash flow hedges, refer to Note 9. 
 Risk management hedging income (loss) also includes price alignment income, which is income received on payments made to a central clearing party for centrally cleared derivatives. Positions are settled daily based on derivative fair values and the party receiving net settlement amounts pays price alignment, based on an earning rate, to the party making settlement payments. Price alignment income totaled million and million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Customer-Initiated and Other 
 The Corporation enters into derivative transactions at the request of customers and generally takes offsetting positions with dealer counterparties to help mitigate the inherent market risk. Income primarily results from the spread between the customer derivative and the offsetting dealer position. 
 For customer-initiated foreign exchange contracts where offsetting positions have not been taken, the Corporation manages the remaining inherent market risk through individual foreign currency position limits and aggregate value-at-risk limits. Position and value-at-risk limits are established annually and monitored daily. For foreign exchange derivative contracts which were not offset or where the Corporation holds a position within the limits described above, the Corporation did not recognize any net gains or losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Corporation did not recognize any gains or loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Bankcard, revolving credit and home equity loan commitments Total unused commitments to extend credit Standby letters of credit Commercial letters of credit 
 The Corporation maintains an allowance to cover current expected credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Unused Commitments to Extend Credit 
 Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to a customer, provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total contractual amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Corporation. Commercial and other unused commitments are primarily variable rate commitments. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments included million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023 for expected credit losses inherent in the Corporation s unused commitments to extend credit. 
 Standby and Commercial Letters of Credit 
 Standby letters of credit represent conditional obligations of the Corporation which guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. Commercial letters of credit are issued to finance foreign or domestic trade transactions. These contracts expire in decreasing amounts through the year. The Corporation may enter into participation arrangements with third parties that effectively reduce the maximum amount of future payments which may be required under standby and commercial letters of credit. These risk participations covered million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of the billion and billion of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The carrying value of the Corporation s standby and commercial letters of credit, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled million at September 30, 2024, including million in deferred fees and million in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. At December 31, 2023, the comparable amounts were million, million and million, respectively.

 Other Credit-Related Financial Instruments 
 The Corporation enters into credit risk participation agreements, under which the Corporation assumes credit exposure associated with a borrower s performance related to certain interest rate derivative contracts. The Corporation is not a party to the interest rate derivative contracts and only enters into these credit risk participation agreements in instances in which the Corporation is also a party to the related loan participation agreements for such borrowers. The Corporation manages its credit risk on the credit risk participation agreements by monitoring the creditworthiness of the borrowers, which is based on the normal credit review process as if the Corporation had entered into the derivative instruments directly with the borrower. The notional amount of such credit risk participation agreements reflects the pro-rata share of the derivative instrument, consistent with its share of the related participated loan. The total notional amount of the credit risk participation agreements was approximately billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the fair value was insignificant at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The maximum estimated exposure to these agreements, as measured by projecting a maximum value of the guaranteed derivative instruments, assuming 100 percent default by all obligors on the maximum values, was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the event of default, the lead bank has the ability to liquidate the assets of the borrower, in which case the lead bank would be required to return a percentage of the recouped assets to the participating banks. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average remaining maturity of outstanding credit risk participation agreements was 4.6 years. 
 In 2008, the Corporation sold its remaining ownership of Visa Class B shares and entered into a derivative contract. Under the terms of the derivative contract, the Corporation will compensate the counterparty primarily for dilutive adjustments made to the conversion factor of the Visa Class B shares to Class A shares based on the ultimate outcome of litigation involving Visa. Conversely, the Corporation will be compensated by the counterparty for any increase in the conversion factor from anti-dilutive adjustments. The fair value of the derivative liability, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 million at September 30, 2024, compared to billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease of approximately million in net deferred tax assets resulted primarily from decreases to deferred tax assets related to hedging gains and losses, net unrealized losses on investment securities available-for-sale and an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to defined benefit plans. Included in deferred tax assets at September 30, 2024 were million of state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and million of federal foreign tax carryforwards, compared to 2 million and 5 million at December 31, 2023, respectively. State NOL carryforwards expire between and and federal foreign tax credit carryforwards expire between and . The Corporation believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from federal foreign tax credits and certain state NOL carryforwards will not be realized and, accordingly, maintained a federal valuation allowance of million at September 30, 2024, compared to 5 million at December 31, 2023. The Corporation maintained a state valuation allowance of million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The determination regarding valuation allowance was based on evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences to absorb the deferred tax assets and assumptions made regarding future events. 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into certain transactions that have tax consequences. From time to time, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other tax jurisdictions may review and/or challenge specific interpretive tax positions taken by the Corporation with respect to those transactions. The Corporation believes its tax returns were filed based upon applicable statutes, regulations and case law in effect at the time of the transactions. The IRS or other tax jurisdictions, an administrative authority or a court, if presented with the transactions, could disagree with the Corporation s interpretation of the tax law. 
 Based on current knowledge and probability assessment of various potential outcomes, the Corporation believes that current tax reserves are adequate, and the amount of any potential incremental liability arising is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary.

 million at September 30, 2024. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters in which the Corporation is involved, taking into account the Corporation s best estimate of such losses for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters for which such estimate can be made. For certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters, the Corporation does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Corporation s estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the legal proceedings and regulatory matters (including the fact that many are currently in preliminary stages), the existence in certain legal proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Corporation) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the legal proceedings and regulatory matters (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such legal proceedings and regulatory matters. Accordingly, the Corporation s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate. 
 In the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the Corporation's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 For information regarding income tax contingencies, refer to Note 12.

 major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the Finance segment. Business segment results are produced by the Corporation s internal management accounting system. This system measures financial results based on the internal business unit structure of the Corporation. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. The management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each business segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. From time to time, the Corporation may make reclassifications among the segments to more appropriately reflect management's current view of the segments, and methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on business unit structure and methodologies in effect at September 30, 2024. 
 The following discussion provides information about the activities of each business segment. A discussion of the financial results and the factors impacting performance can be found in "Business Segments" in the "Strategic Lines of Business" section of the financial review. 
 The Commercial Bank meets the needs of small and middle market businesses, multinational corporations and governmental entities by offering various products and services including commercial loans and lines of credit, deposits, cash management, payment solutions, card services, capital market products, international trade finance and letters of credit.

These forward-looking statements are predicated on the beliefs and assumptions of the Corporation's management based on information known to the Corporation's management as of the date of this report and do not purport to speak as of any other date. Forward-looking statements may include descriptions of plans and objectives of the Corporation's management for future or past operations, products or services and forecasts of the Corporation's revenue, earnings or other measures of economic performance, including statements of profitability, business segments and subsidiaries as well as estimates of credit trends and global stability. Such statements reflect the view of the Corporation's management as of this date with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks materialize or should underlying beliefs or assumptions prove incorrect, the Corporation's actual results could differ materially from those discussed. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include credit risks (changes in customer behavior; unfavorable developments concerning credit quality; and declines or other changes in the businesses or industries of the Corporation's customers); market risks (changes in monetary and fiscal policies; fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing; and transitions away from the Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield Index towards new interest rate benchmarks); liquidity risks (the Corporation's ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity; reductions in the Corporation's credit rating; and the interdependence of financial service companies and their soundness); technology risks (cybersecurity risks and heightened legislative and regulatory focus on cybersecurity and data privacy); operational risks (operational, systems or infrastructure failures; reliance on other companies to provide certain key components of business infrastructure; the impact of legal and regulatory proceedings or determinations; losses due to fraud; and controls and procedures failures); compliance risks (changes in regulation or oversight, or changes in the Corporation s status with respect to existing regulations or oversight; the effects of stringent capital requirements; and the impacts of future legislative, administrative or judicial changes to tax regulations); strategic risks (damage to the Corporation's reputation; the Corporation's ability to utilize technology to efficiently and effectively develop, market and deliver new products and services; competitive product and pricing pressures among financial institutions within the Corporation's markets; the implementation of the Corporation's strategies and business initiatives; management's ability to maintain and expand customer relationships; management's ability to retain key officers and employees; and any future strategic acquisitions or divestitures); and other general risks (changes in general economic, political or industry conditions; negative effects from inflation; the effectiveness of methods of reducing risk exposures; the effects of catastrophic events, including pandemics; physical or transition risks related to climate change; changes in accounting standards; the critical nature of the Corporation's accounting policies, processes and management estimates; the volatility of the Corporation's stock price; and that an investment in the Corporation's equity securities is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC). The Corporation cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not all-inclusive. For discussion of factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors beginning on page 14 of the Corporation's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. The Corporation does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made.

 Net interest income increased 1 million to 534 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 533 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, while net interest margin decreased 6 basis points to 2.80 percent during the same period. Net interest income was impacted by an increase of 1.3 billion in deposits held with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), declines of 589 million in short-term borrowings and 233 million in medium- and long-term debt and the impact of one additional day in the quarter, offset by a 1.8 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits, the net impact of lower short-term rates, lower nonaccrual loan interest and a 210 million decline in loan volume. The decrease in net interest margin reflected higher interest-bearing deposit costs and lower nonaccrual interest, partially offset by higher deposits held with the FRB and the decline in debt balances.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses, which includes the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, was 14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to no provision in the previous quarter. The allowance for credit losses increased 3 million to 720 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 717 million at June 30, 2024, reflecting changes in loan portfolio composition and a relatively consistent economic outlook. As a percentage of total loans, the allowance for credit losses increased 5 basis points to 1.43 at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.38 at June 30, 2024. Net loan charge-offs were 11 million for both three-month periods, reflecting improvements in Corporate Banking and Mortgage Banker Finance, offset by a decline in Energy net recoveries. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was an expense of 3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a benefit of 6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and a summary of nonperforming assets are presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.

 (a) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 
 Noninterest income decreased 14 million to 277 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, driven by a decrease in risk management hedging income mostly from lower price alignment income due to changes in cash balances held with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), as well as a loss on a derivative related to Visa's Class B shares, partially offset by increases in deferred compensation asset returns (offset in noninterest expenses) and capital markets income, as well as smaller increases in other categories. The decrease in cash balances held with the CME resulted in an increase in FRB deposits (reported within interest-bearing deposits with banks), which resulted in a corresponding increase to interest income. Other noninterest income is detailed in the table below.

 (a) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in other noninterest income and the corresponding change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. 
 (b) The three months ended September 30, 2024 included a 5 million loss, while the three months ended June 30, 2024 included a 6 million gain, both pertaining to a derivative related to Visa's Class B shares.

 Noninterest expenses increased 7 million to 562 million, primarily due to increased salaries and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance expense (mostly driven by changes to the special assessment estimates by the FDIC). Salaries and benefits expense included increases in deferred compensation asset returns (mostly offset in other noninterest income) and staff additions, as well as impacts from an additional day in the quarter, higher incentive compensation and stock-based compensation. Other noninterest expenses included an increase in operational losses, partially offset by a decrease in consulting expenses.

Table of Contents 

 Noninterest income decreased 76 million to 804 million, driven by a decrease in risk management hedging income, which included 39 million in losses related to BSBY cessation, partially offset by an increase in price alignment income received for centrally cleared derivative positions, as well as declines in card fees (mostly government card interchange fees) and fiduciary income, partially offset by an increase in brokerage fees. Other noninterest income for the 2024 period included a 5 million negotiated vendor payment, while other noninterest income for the 2023 period was reduced by 5 million in losses on assets held for sale. 
 The following table presents certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

 Noninterest expenses increased 79 million to 1.7 billion, due to increases in salaries and benefits expense, FDIC insurance expense (related to special assessment), software expense and occupancy expense, partially offset by a decline in other noninterest expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits expense reflected the impact of annual merit-based salary increases and staff additions, as well as increases in deferred compensation expense (mostly offset in other noninterest income), staff insurance and payroll taxes, partially offset by lower severance costs. Other noninterest expenses included decreases in litigation-related expenses and non-salary pension expense, as well as a contract termination cost recorded in the 2023 period, partially offset by gains on the sale of real estate recorded in the 2023 period. 

STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS 
 The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2023 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology.

Table of Contents 

 Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP) funding credits and charges. The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. Due to the longer-term nature of implied maturities, FTP crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. As a result of applying matched funding, interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds, as well as the volume of deposits at the associated FTP crediting rates. Generally, in periods of rising interest rates, FTP charge rates for funding loans and FTP crediting rates on deposits will increase, with FTP crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than FTP charge rates for funding loans. Conversely, in periods of declining interest rates, FTP charge rates for funding loans and FTP crediting rates on deposits will decrease, with FTP crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than FTP charge rates for funding loans. 
 Business Segments 
 The following sections present a summary of the performance of each of the Corporation's business segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year.

 n/m - not meaningful 
 Average loans decreased 3.1 billion, and included decreases in Equity Fund Services and general Middle Market, as well as Mortgage Banker Finance due to the exit from this line of business, partially offset by an increase in Commercial Real Estate. Average deposits decreased 1.4 billion, primarily driven by lower noninterest-bearing deposits, with the largest declines in Technology and Life Sciences, Energy and Mortgage Banker Finance. 
 The Commercial Bank's net income decreased 80 million to 824 million. Net interest income decreased 144 million due to higher interest expense on deposits and higher allocated net FTP charges. The provision for credit losses decreased 59 million, reflecting changes in portfolio composition, lower loan balances and an improved economic outlook. Net charge-offs increased 31 million to 32 million, driven by general Middle Market, partially offset by improvements in Energy and Technology and Life Sciences. Noninterest income decreased 18 million primarily due to lower capital markets income and card fees, partially offset by a 5 million negotiated vendor payment recorded in the first quarter of 2024. Noninterest expenses increased 21 million, primarily reflecting increases in salaries and benefits expense and FDIC insurance expense (related to special assessment), partially offset by lower operational losses and litigation and regulatory-related expenses.

 Average loans decreased 184 million, while average deposits decreased 302 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. Wealth Management's net income decreased 16 million to 61 million. Net interest income decreased 18 million, primarily due to higher interest expense on deposits and higher allocated net FTP charges, partially offset by an increase in loan income. Noninterest income decreased 17 million, primarily driven by lower investment fees and insurance commissions, while noninterest expenses decreased 23 million, reflecting lower salaries and benefits expense (related to November 2023 change in presentation consistent with contractual terms with new investment program partner resulting in a net decrease to commission costs, with the offset recorded in noninterest income) and litigation and regulatory-related expenses, partially offset by higher operational losses and outside processing fee expense.

 Average deposits, which primarily consist of centrally-managed brokered time deposits fully insured by the FDIC, decreased 267 million. Net loss for the Finance and Other category increased 180 million to 480 million. Net interest expense increased 118 million, reflecting the impact of interest rate swaps (which are centrally managed) as well as increased balances from higher-cost funding sources. Noninterest income decreased 37 million primarily due to risk management hedging losses related to BSBY cessation, partially offset by an increase in price alignment income received for centrally cleared derivative positions. Noninterest expenses increased 59 million, reflecting increases in salaries and benefits expense and consulting fees, as well as gains recorded on the sale of real estate in the 2023 period, partially offset by an improvement in non-salary pension expense.

 (b) Consists of approximately 23,000 shares purchased related to deferred compensation plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and is not considered part of the Corporation's repurchase program. 
 On October 22, 2024, the Corporation resumed repurchasing its common shares under its previously established share repurchase program by entering into an accelerated share repurchase ASR agreement to repurchase 100 million of its common stock. Under the terms of the ASR agreement, the Corporation received an initial delivery of common shares representing approximately 80 of the expected total to be repurchased. Subject to certain adjustments pursuant to the ASR agreement, the final number of shares repurchased and delivered under the ASR agreement will be based on the volume weighted average share price of the Corporation's common stock during the term of the transaction, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Since the inception of the share repurchase program in 2010, a total of 97.2 million shares have been authorized for repurchase. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase program, which may be effectuated through open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, structured repurchase agreements with third parties and/or otherwise, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and actual amount of additional share repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation's earnings generation, capital needs to fund future loan growth and market conditions. 
 The Corporation has a long-term CET1 capital ratio target of approximately 10 percent with capital deployment. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation's estimated CET1 capital ratio was 11.97 percent, up from 11.09 percent at December 31, 2023.

 Common shareholders equity included 2.4 billion in accumulated other comprehensive losses, with approximately 2.0 billion of those losses relating to balances recorded in total assets, comprised of valuation adjustments to available-for-sale securities and pension assets, as well as related deferred tax assets. These amounts impacted the common shareholders equity ratio by 267 basis points; the impact on the tangible common equity ratio using the same calculation method was 271 basis points. Average common shareholders' equity and return on average common shareholders' equity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.5 billion and 10.88 , respectively, compared to 4.9 billion and 2.17 , respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2023. 
 Basel III Endgame Framework 
 On July 27, 2023, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, commonly referred to as Basel III Endgame (the Capital Proposal) that would significantly increase the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations with total assets of 100 billion or more. The Capital Proposal would align the regulatory capital calculation and the calculation of risk-weighted assets across large banking organizations subject to the Capital Proposal and require Category III and IV banking organizations to include most components of AOCI, including net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, in their regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Proposal was subject to a public comment period, which ended on January 16, 2024. If adopted as proposed, the Capital Proposal would include a three-year transition period beginning July 1, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had total assets of 79.7 billion. While the Capital Proposal would not apply to the Corporation as it is currently proposed, if the Corporation becomes subject to the requirements of the Capital Proposal in the future or becomes subject to any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity, such requirements could limit the Corporation s ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or require Comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital, which would have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial condition and results of operations. If subject to the Capital Proposal, the estimated impact related to proposed inclusion of most components of AOCI would be an approximate 285 basis point decrease to common equity tier-1 capital based on September 30, 2024 financials. 
 
 RISK MANAGEMENT 
 The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-18 through F-34 in the Corporation's 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses decreased 8 million from 728 million at December 31, 2023 to 720 million at September 30, 2024.

 The following table presents metrics of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans.

 The economic forecasts informing the current expected credit loss (CECL) model reflects the FRB's pivot to monetary policy recalibration and lower interest rates, consumer spending growth moderation and slower, albeit continued, growth of the real economy. Inflation is gradually moderating as a modest margin of slack capacity opens in the labor market. Energy prices are projected to level off despite continued crosswinds from the Russia-Ukraine and Mideast wars, as U.S. crude production holds near a record high. Residential real estate property prices are expected to rise at more moderate rates, while commercial real estate prices face headwinds, both reflecting the long and variable lags of the FRB's tighter monetary policy prior to the beginning of rate cuts in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Downside risks to growth from geopolitical risks, cost-of-living pressures on household finances and less expansionary fiscal policy are projected to collectively contribute to slower growth in 2024 and 2025. Reduced demand for office space and subdued economic activity in the central business districts of major metro areas persist as drags on the broader economy. The FRB's gradual rate cuts driven by a softening labor market and disinflation aim to contain the risk of recession. 
 These factors shaped the 2-year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the Corporation in its CECL estimate at September 30, 2024. The U.S. economy is projected to grow at a below-trend rate through 2024 and 2025, before gradually normalizing to its trend growth rate. The unemployment rate is expected to hold below 5 percent and oil prices are expected to decline, while interest rate forecasts reflect market expectations and guidance from the FRB available during the third quarter of 2024. The following table summarizes select variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the CECL estimate at September 30, 2024. 
 Economic Variable Base Forecast Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth Growth slows to 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter 2024 before recovering to approximately 2.0 percent by the end of the forecast period. 
 Unemployment rate Expected to hold at approximately 4.2 percent through fourth quarter 2025 followed by a modest decline in 2026 to 4.1 percent by the end of the forecast period. 
 Spread of Corporate BBB bond to 10-year Treasury bond 
 Spread widens to 2.1 percent during second half of 2025 before normalizing to approximately 2.0 percent by third quarter 2026. 
 Oil Prices Prices generally decline from 77 per barrel to approximately 73 per barrel over the forecast period. 
 
 Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding assumptions used as inputs to the forecast, the Corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios, including more benign and more severe economic forecasts. In a more severe scenario, real GDP is projected to contract through the second quarter 2025, subsequently recovering growth of 1.7 percent by the end of the forecast period. Oil prices fall to below 58 per barrel by first quarter 2026 followed by an increase to 63 per barrel by the end of the forecast period, while the unemployment rate remains elevated through the end of the forecast period. Selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses of approximately 361 million as of September 30, 2024. However, factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario. The Corporation monitors evolving economic conditions for impacts to the allowance for credit losses. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation s loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses, which totaled 686 million at September 30, 2024, was relatively stable compared to 688 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors, designed to estimate current expected credit losses, to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools. The allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis. Individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows.

Table of Contents 

 Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 
 The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors, determined in a manner similar to business loans, multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments totaled 34 million and 40 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section and pages F-51 through F-52 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2023 Annual Report.

Loans past due 90 days or more was 21 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 20 million at December 31, 2023. Loans past due 30-89 days decreased 51 million to 147 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 198 million at December 31, 2023. Loans past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest as a percentage of total loans were 0.33 percent and 0.42 percent at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. An aging analysis of loans included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising past due loans. 
 The following table presents a summary of total criticized loans. The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Criticized loans on nonaccrual status are individually subjected to quarterly credit quality reviews, and the Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans. A table of loans by credit quality indicator included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising total criticized loans. Criticized loans were relatively flat compared to June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. The Corporation has concentrations of credit risk with the commercial real estate and automotive industries. All other industry concentrations, as defined by management, individually represented less than 10 percent of total loans at September 30, 2024.

 Commercial Real Estate Lending 
 At September 30, 2024, the Corporation's commercial real estate portfolio represented 37 percent of total loans. The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in millions) Commercial Real Estate business line (a) Other (b) Total Commercial Real Estate business line (a) Other (b) Total Real estate construction loans 3,571 288 3,859 4,570 513 5,083 Commercial mortgage loans 6,196 8,578 14,774 4,727 8,959 13,686 Total commercial real estate 9,767 8,866 18,633 9,297 9,472 18,769 
 (a) Primarily loans to real estate developers. 
 (b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. 
 The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled 18.6 billion at September 30, 2024. Commercial real estate loans made to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, totaled 9.8 billion, or 52 percent of total commercial real estate loans, an increase of 470 million compared to December 31, 2023. The Commercial Real Estate business line at September 30, 2024 was predominantly secured by multi-family and industrial properties, comprising 50 and 28 of the portfolio, respectively, with only 4 secured by office properties. 
 Commercial real estate loans in other business lines totaled 8.9 billion, or 48 percent of total commercial real estate loans, at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 606 million compared to December 31, 2023. These loans consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. Generally, loans previously reported as real estate construction are classified as commercial mortgage loans upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. 
 The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. There were 36 million in criticized real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line and 2 million in other business lines at September 30, 2024, compared to 86 million in the Commercial Real Estate business line and 12 million in other business lines at December 31, 2023. 
 For the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, as well as the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no net charge-offs of real estate construction loans. 
 Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled 392 million and 378 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In other business lines, 556 million and 395 million of commercial mortgage loans were criticized at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with the increase primarily in senior housing properties, largely managed in the Corporate Banking line of business. Senior housing loans totaled 722 million at September 30, 2024, of which 44 were criticized, compared to 796 million at December 31, 2023, of which 11 were criticized. 
 Commercial mortgage net charge-offs were 9 million and 5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, commercial mortgage net charge-offs were 14 million, compared to none for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell. 
 Residential mortgages totaled 1.9 billion at September 30, 2024, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the 1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, 36 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2024, an increase of 17 million compared to December 31, 2023. The home equity portfolio totaled 1.8 billion at September 30, 2024, of which 95 percent was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and 5 percent were in amortizing status. Of the 1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, 25 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2024. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at September 30, 2024. 
 Energy Lending 
 The Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that are included entirely in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line are engaged in exploration and production (E P) and midstream. E P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated prices (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. Approximately 95 of loans in the Energy business line are Shared National Credits (SNC), which are facilities greater than or equal to 100 million shared by three or more federally supervised institutions, reflecting the Corporation's focus on larger middle market companies that have financing needs that generally exceed internal individual borrower credit risk limits. The Corporation seeks to develop full relationships with SNC borrowers. 
 The following table summarizes information about loans in the Corporation's Energy business line.

 Loans in the Energy business line totaled 1.3 billion, or less than 3 percent of total loans, at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 70 million compared to December 31, 2023. Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was 3.3 billion at September 30, 2024 (a utilization rate of 39 percent) and 3.3 billion at December 31, 2023 (a utilization rate of 42 percent). There were no nonaccrual or criticized Energy loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 4 million at December 31, 2023. There were no Energy net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net recoveries of 9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Energy net recoveries were 9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net recoveries of 1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Leveraged Loans 
 Certain loans in the Corporation's commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions. These loans are typically used for mergers, acquisitions, business recapitalizations, refinancing and equity buyouts. To help mitigate the risk associated with these loans, the Corporation focuses on middle market companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral, the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants. During the underwriting process, cash flows are stress-tested to evaluate the borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates. 
 The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans. 
 The following tables summarize information about HR C I loans, which represented 5 percent of total loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 There were 14 million in net charge-offs of leveraged loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Market and Liquidity Risk 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times. 
 The Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. Corporate Treasury helps mitigate market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions. 
 The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of scenarios, including both idiosyncratic and market-wide in nature, which vary in terms of duration and severity. The Corporation's evaluation as of September 30, 2024 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events. 
 In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations, such as debt service, dividend payments and normal operating expenses, over a period of no less than 12 months. The Corporation had liquid assets of 1.3 billion on an unconsolidated basis at September 30, 2024. 
 Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at September 30, 2024 was 56 percent fixed-rate, 35 percent overnight to 30-day rate, 6 percent 90-day and greater rates and 3 percent prime. The composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. Other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio. 
 The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. 
 Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.

 Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates 
 The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base-case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model assumptions. Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns. Additionally, the analysis assumes that all loan hedges qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis. Model assumptions in the sensitivity scenarios at September 30, 2024 included for the rising rate scenarios, a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances, and for the declining rate scenarios, a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances. In addition, both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels, an incremental interest-bearing deposit beta of approximately 47 , deposit mix shifts based on historical observations, partial reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps. 
 The average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was 15.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 with an average yield of 2.17 and effective duration of 5.6 years. 
 The table below details components of the variable-rate loan swap portfolio at September 30, 2024.

 (a) Years to maturity calculated from a starting date of September 30, 2024. 
 (b) Includes forward starting swaps of 6.1 billion starting in fourth quarter 2024. Excluding forward starting swaps, the weighted average yield was 2.51 . 
 (c) Excludes 5.6 billion of bridge swaps used for BSBY transition purposes by the CME. See "BSBY Cessation" section for more information. 
 The analysis also includes interest rate swaps that convert 6.8 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt and FHLB advances to variable rates through fair value hedges. Additionally, included in this analysis are 15.0 billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of 51 basis points at September 30, 2024. This base-case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which short-term rates rise or decline 100 or 200 basis points (with a floor of zero percent) in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change of 50 or 100 basis points over the period. 
 The table below, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.

 Sensitivity to both rising and declining interest rates decreased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 due to changes in balance sheet mix dynamics.

Table of Contents 

 At September 30, 2024, additional sensitivity scenarios applied the rising and declining 100 basis point scenario assumptions with a 60 incremental deposit beta relative to the base case scenario to assess the impact of the Corporation's deposit beta assumptions. In these rising and declining scenarios, net interest income decreased by 50 million and increased by 31 million, respectively, due to a more rapid repricing pace compared to the standard model assumptions. 
 Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates 
 In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 or 200 basis point shock with a floor of zero percent. 
 The table below, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollar amounts in millions) Amount Amount Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points (586) (5 Rising 100 basis points (567) (4 Declining 100 basis points 700 5 Declining 100 basis points 794 6 Rising 200 basis points

 The sensitivity of economic value of equity to rising and declining rates was largely unchanged from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 BSBY Cessation 
 On November 15, 2023, the Bloomberg Index Services Limited (Bloomberg) announced that it will discontinue publishing BSBY on November 15, 2024; accordingly, the Corporation was required to de-designate 7.0 billion of interest rate swaps used in cash flow hedges of certain BSBY-indexed loans and reclassify amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings. For each de-designated swap, settlement of interest payments and changes in fair value were recorded as risk management hedging losses within other noninterest income instead of net interest income until re-designation. All impacted swaps were re-designated as of April 1, 2024. 
 BSBY cessation negatively impacted interest income on commercial loans by 9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of re-designated interest rate hedges. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had 22.8 billion of exposure to BSBY-based products, including 12.4 billion in loans and 10.4 billion in interest rate swaps. The Corporation ceased originating BSBY-based products and is working to convert BSBY-based loans to other indices as repricing opportunities occur. The Corporation expects any BSBY-based contracts that do not organically transition to SOFR by November 15, 2024, will transition to SOFR through existing fallback language, which for loans is the first repricing date after BSBY cessation occurs in November 2024. For interest rate swaps, the Corporation plans to enact the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Definition and Benchmark Supplement language, as applicable. 
 In the third quarter of 2023, as part of the transition from BSBY to SOFR, the CME converted existing BSBY swaps into two swaps: a short-dated BSBY swap (bridge swap) and a forward starting SOFR swap (surviving swap). The two swaps are designed to cover the same period of time as the original BSBY swap. As a result of this approach, the conversion resulted in a temporary 9.3 billion increase in notional balances when compared to the former BSBY-based swaps cleared through the CME, which consisted of 5.6 billion in cash flow swaps and 3.7 billion in customer-initiated swaps. This temporary increase in notional amounts due to the bridge swaps is expected to resolve in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Sources of Liquidity 
 The Corporation maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations while taking into account potential commitment draws and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. The majority of the Corporation's balance sheet is funded by customer deposits. Cash flows from loan repayments, increases in deposit accounts (including brokered deposits), activity in the securities portfolio and wholesale funding channels serve as the Corporation's primary liquidity sources. 
 The Corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources. Available liquidity includes cash, FHLB advances and FRB borrowing through the discount window, as well as the market value of unencumbered investment securities, which, if needed, could be utilized as collateral for FHLB advances and FRB borrowings. The Corporation has pledged a portion of its investment securities portfolio to access wholesale funding as needed. 
 The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related loans, certain government agency-backed securities and other eligible assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB and the fair value of pledged assets, as well as applicable FHLB haircuts. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Bank had pledged real estate-related loans totaling 22.5 billion and investment securities totaling 6.4 billion to the FHLB, which provided for up to 17.3 billion of collateralized borrowing with the FHLB. 
 The FRB provides liquidity through its discount window, where banks may borrow funds based on the discounted fair value of pledged assets. At September 30, 2024, the Bank pledged 20.3 billion of loans to the FRB, which provided for up to 16.8 billion of collateralized borrowing through the discount window. 
 The table below details the Corporation's sources of available liquidity at September 30, 2024.

 (b) Market value of available-for-sale investment securities that the Corporation can pledge or sell without third-party consent. 
 The Corporation may also use brokered deposits and external debt as additional sources of funding, and maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission through which it may issue securities. The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise unsecured funding at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital, earnings and other relevant factors related to the Corporation and the Bank. As of September 30, 2024, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank, as well as long-term deposits at the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

 Deposit Concentrations and Uninsured Deposits 
 The Corporation's uninsured deposits are well-diversified between geographies, industries and customers. At September 30, 2024, the Retail Bank and general Middle Market segments, both highly diversified and granular, accounted for 38 and 27 of the total deposit base, respectively. Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences comprised 6 and 5 each of total deposits, respectively, which were the largest deposit concentrations of the more specialized business lines. 
 Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollar amount in millions) 
 Amount Percentage of total deposits Amount Percentage of total deposits Total uninsured deposits, as calculated per regulatory guidelines 31,926 51 31,485 47 Less: affiliate deposits (3,839) (4,064) Total uninsured deposits, excluding affiliate deposits 28,087 45 27,421 41 
 Time deposits otherwise uninsured, which consist of foreign office time deposits, totaled 25 million at September 30, 2024 and all mature in three months or less. Collateralized deposits, consisting of trust deposits as well as deposits of public entities and state and local government agencies, totaled 361 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 687 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Direct Express Debit MasterCard Program 
 In July 2024, the Bank received preliminary notification that it was not selected to continue serving as financial agent supporting the Direct Express Debit MasterCard Program for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Treasury), following the contract expiration on January 2, 2025. As financial agent, the Bank has been the exclusive issuer of the Direct Express prepaid debit card for federal benefit recipients. The contract provides for a potential extension of the contract term for up to three years past January 2, 2025, to facilitate an orderly transition. Under the contract, Treasury will use reasonable efforts to notify the Bank by December 3, 2024, of its exercise of the transition period extension option. While the length of the transition is currently unknown, the Corporation believes it may take some time given the scale and complexity of the program as well as its own transition experience. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, average deposits related to the Direct Express program were 3.4 billion, all of which were noninterest-bearing. Card fee income related to the Direct Express program was 137 million and 30 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Outside processing expenses related to the Direct Express program were 138 million and 29 million, respectively, for the same periods. The Corporation cannot currently predict the impact that the loss of this contract and the related deposits could have on its financial statements as it will be subject to many factors, including the timing, costs and extent of securing any necessary alternative sources of funding. However, such impact could be material.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The Corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2023 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2023, the most critical of these estimates related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-35 through F-38 in the Corporation's 2023 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting estimates as disclosed in the Corporation's 2023 Annual Report.

 SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA 
 The Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. Tangible common equity is used by the Corporation to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk. Common equity tier 1 capital ratio removes preferred stock from the Tier 1 capital ratio as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets.

 Total uninsured deposits as calculated per regulatory guidance and reported on schedule RC-O of the Bank s Call Report include affiliate deposits, which by definition have a different risk profile than other uninsured deposits. The amounts presented below remove affiliate deposits from the total uninsured deposits number. The Corporation believes that the presentation of uninsured deposits adjusted for the impact of affiliate deposits provides enhanced clarity of uninsured deposits at risk.

Exhibit 99.1 
 COMERICA INCORPORATED 
 COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY 
 
 1. Purpose . This Policy sets forth the terms on which the Company may recover erroneously awarded compensation to its executive officers. This Policy is intended to comply with Section 10D of the Exchange Act and Section 303A.14 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. 
 2. Definitions . Unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms used in this Policy shall have the following meanings 
 (a) Board means the Board of Directors of the Company. 
 (b) Committee means the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board. 
 (c) Company means Comerica Incorporated. 
 (d) Effective Date means October 2, 2023. 
 (e) Exchange means the New York Stock Exchange. 
 (f) Exchange Act means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time, and any successor thereto. 
 (g) erroneously awarded compensation has the meaning set forth in Section 3(c). 
 (h) executive officer means the Company s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division or function (such as sales, administration or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. Executive officers of the Company s parent(s) or subsidiaries are deemed executive officers of the Company if they perform such policy-making functions for the Company. In addition, (i) if the Company became a limited partnership, officers or employees of the general partner(s) of the Company who perform policy-making functions for the Company are deemed executive officers of the Company and (ii) if the Company became a trust, officers or employees of the trustee(s) of the Company who perform policy-making functions for the Company are deemed executive officers of the Company. Policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant. An executive officer for purposes of this Policy includes at a minimum executive officers identified pursuant to Item 401(b) of SEC Regulation S-K. 
 (i) financial reporting measures means measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also financial reporting measures. 
 (j) incentive-based compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure. 
 (k) Policy means this Comerica Incorporated Compensation Recovery Policy, as in effect from time to time. 
 (l) received has the following meaning incentive-based compensation is deemed received in the Company s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified in the incentive-based compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the incentive-based compensation occurs after the end of that period. 
 (m) SEC means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

3. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation . The Company shall recover reasonably promptly the amount of erroneously awarded compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 
 (a) Scope of Policy . This Policy shall apply to all incentive-based compensation received after the Effective Date by a person 
 (i) After beginning service as an executive officer 
 (ii) Who served as an executive officer at any time during the performance period for that incentive-based compensation 
 (iii) While the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association and 
 (iv) During the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement as described in the first paragraph of this Section 3. In addition to these last three completed fiscal years, this Policy shall apply to any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years. However, a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months would be deemed a completed fiscal year. The Company s obligation to recover erroneously awarded compensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed. 
 (b) Date of Accounting Restatement . The date that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement as described in the first paragraph of this Section 3 is the earlier to occur of 
 (i) the date on which the Board, a committee thereof or the Company s officer(s) authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement as described in the first paragraph of this Section 3 and 
 (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an accounting restatement as described in the first paragraph of this Section 3. 
 (c) Amount Subject to Recovery . The amount of incentive-based compensation subject to this Policy erroneously awarded compensation is the amount of incentive-based compensation received that exceeds the amount of incentive-based compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, and shall be computed without regard to any taxes paid. For incentive-based compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an accounting restatement (i) the amount shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the incentive-based compensation was received and (ii) the Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Exchange. 
 (d) Impracticability of Recovery . The Company shall recover erroneously awarded compensation in compliance with this Policy except to the extent that the conditions of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) below are met, and the Committee (or in the absence thereof, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board) has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable. 
 (i) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the Exchange. 

(ii) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company shall obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the Exchange, that recovery would result in such a violation, and shall provide such opinion to the Exchange. 
 (iii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 
 (e) Prohibition on Indemnification . The Company shall not indemnify any current or former executive officer against the loss of erroneously awarded compensation. 
 (f) Method of Recovery . The Committee shall determine, in its sole and exclusive discretion, the method or methods for recovering any erroneously awarded compensation, which methods need not be the same, or applied in the same manner, to each executive officer, provided that any such method shall provide for reasonably prompt recovery and otherwise comply with any requirements of the Exchange. 
 4. Disclosure . The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the Federal securities laws, including the disclosure required by the applicable rules of the SEC. 
 5. Administration . 
 (a) Effective Date . This Policy shall take effect on the Effective Date and shall supplement the Company s Recoupment Policy (as in effect from time to time, the Existing Policy ). 
 (b) Authority of Committee . This Policy shall be administered and interpreted by the Committee in accordance with Section 303A.14 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, Section 10D of the Exchange Act and other applicable Federal securities laws and regulations. Except as limited by applicable law, and subject to the provisions of this Policy, the Committee shall have full power, authority and sole and exclusive discretion to construe, interpret and administer this Policy, and to delegate its authority pursuant to this Policy. In addition, the Committee shall have full and exclusive power to adopt such rules, regulations and guidelines for carrying out this Policy and to amend this Policy, in each case, as it may deem necessary or proper. Subject to Section 3(d), this Policy also may be administered by the Board, and references in this Policy to the Committee shall be understood to refer to the full Board. 
 (c) Decisions Binding . In making any determination or in taking or not taking any action under this Policy, the Committee may obtain and rely on the advice of experts, including employees of, and professional advisors to, the Company. Any action taken by, or inaction of, the Committee or its delegates relating to or pursuant to this Policy shall be within the absolute discretion of the Committee or its delegates. Such action or inaction of the Committee or its delegates shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and any current or former executive officer affected by such action or inaction. 
 (d) Policy Not Exclusive . Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery, recoupment, forfeiture or offset that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any other applicable Company policy (including the Existing Policy), compensation or benefit plan, agreement or arrangement or other agreement or applicable law provided , however , that there shall be no duplication of recovery of the same compensation.
