 Total Revenue 

Gaming Operations 
 
 Gaming operations revenue is earned by providing customers with gaming machines, gaming machine content licenses, table products, back-office equipment and linked progressive systems, which are collectively referred to as gaming equipment, under participation arrangements. The participation arrangements convey the right to use the equipment (i.e., gaming machines and related integral software) for a stated period of time, which typically ranges from one to three years upon which the contract continues on a month-to-month basis thereafter. In some instances, the Company will enter into arrangements for longer periods of time; however, many of these arrangements include the ability of the customer to cancel the contract and return the games to the Company, a provision which renders the contracts effectively month-to-month contracts. The Company will also enter into lease contracts with a revenue sharing arrangement whereby the lease payments due from the customer are variable. Our participation arrangements are accounted for as operating leases primarily due to these factors. In some instances, we will offer a free trial period during which no revenue is recognized. If during or at the conclusion of the trial period the customer chooses to enter into a lease for the gaming equipment, we commence revenue recognition according to the terms of the agreement. 

Under participation arrangements, the Company retains ownership of the gaming equipment installed at the customer facilities and receives either revenue based on a percentage of the win per day generated by the gaming equipment or a fixed daily fee. Thus, in our consolidated financial statements the Company records revenue monthly related to these arrangements and the gaming equipment is recorded in property and equipment, net on our condensed consolidated balance sheet and depreciated over the expected life of the gaming equipment. 
 
 The majority of the Company s leases require the Company to provide maintenance throughout the entire term of the lease. In some cases, a performance guarantee exists that, if not met, provides the customer with the right to return the gaming machines to the Company. This performance guarantee is considered a cancellation clause, a provision which renders the contracts effectively month-to-month contracts. Accordingly, the Company accounts for these contracts in a similar manner with its other operating leases as described above. 
 
 Gaming operations revenue is also earned from the licensing and maintenance of gaming equipment content and licensing of table product content. It is earned and recognized primarily on a daily or monthly fixed rate. Our B2C social casino products earn revenue from the sale of virtual coins or chips, which is recorded when the purchased coins or chips are used by the customer. B2C social casino revenue is presented gross of the platform fees. B2B social casino products earn revenue primarily based on a percentage of the monthly revenue generated by the white label casino apps that we build and operate for our customers. RMG revenue is earned primarily based on a percentage of the revenue produced by the games on our platform as well as monthly platform fees and initial integration fees. RMG revenue is presented net of payments to game and content suppliers. 
 
 Equipment Sales 
 
 Revenues from contracts with customers are recognized and recorded when the following criteria are met: 
 
 We have a contract that has been approved by both the customer and the Company. Our contracts specify the products being sold and payment terms and are recognized when it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the contracted amount; and 
 Control has been transferred and services have been rendered in accordance with the contract terms. 

Equipment sales are generated from the sale of gaming machines, table products and licensing rights to the integral game content software that is installed in the related equipment, parts, and other ancillary equipment. Also included within the deliverables are delivery, installation and training, all of which occur within a few days of arriving at the customer location. Equipment sales do not include maintenance beyond a standard warranty period. The recognition of revenue from the sale of gaming devices occurs as the customer obtains control of the product and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Our contracts include a fixed transaction price. Amounts are due from customers within 30 to 90 days of the invoice date and to a lesser extent we offer extended payment terms of 12 to 24 months with payments due monthly during the extended payment period. 
 
 The Company enters into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple performance obligations, which are typically multiple distinct products that may be shipped to the customer at different times. For example, sales arrangements may include the sale of gaming machines and table products to be delivered upon the consummation of the contract and additional game content conversion kits that will be delivered at a later date when requested by the customer to replace the game content on the customer s existing gaming machines. Products are identified as separate performance obligations if they are distinct, which occurs if the customer can benefit from the product on its own and is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. 
 
 Revenue is allocated to the separate performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices determined at contract inception. Standalone selling prices are primarily determined by prices that we charge for the products when they are sold separately. When a product is not sold separately, we determine the standalone selling price with reference to our standard pricing policies and practices. We elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price, sales taxes and all other items of a similar nature, and also elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment of our promise to transfer the goods. Accordingly, shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. 
 
 Revenue allocated to any undelivered performance obligations is recorded as a contract liability and recorded in accrued liabilities on our balance sheet. 

million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the value of finished goods inventory was million and million, respectively. There was no work in process material as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 
 to 
 Other property and equipment (in years) to 

Financed leased cars and leasehold improvements are amortized/depreciated over the life of the contract. 
 
 The Company reviews its property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company groups long-lived assets for impairment analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be measured independently of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. This is typically at the individual gaming machine level or at the cabinet product line level. Impairment testing is performed and losses are estimated when indicators of impairment are present and the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount. 
 
 When the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the asset s carrying amount, an impairment loss is measured to the extent the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. 
 
 The Company measures recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. The Company s policy is to impair, when necessary, excess or obsolete gaming machines on hand that are not expected to be used. Impairment is based upon several factors, including estimated forecast of gaming machine demand for placement into casinos. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions used in evaluating the carrying amount of these assets are reasonable, different assumptions could affect either the carrying amount or the estimated useful lives of the assets, which could have a significant impact on the results of operations and financial position. 

Other property and equipment 
 Less: Accumulated depreciation 
 Total property and equipment, net 

Gaming equipment and other property and equipment are depreciated over the respective useful lives of the assets ranging from one to five years. Depreciation expense was million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Depreciation expense was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): 
 
 - - 
 Trade and brand names - 
 Customer relationships - 
 Contract rights under development and placement fees -

 Total intangible assets 

Intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from one to twelve years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The Company enters into development agreements and placement fee agreements with certain customers to secure floor space under lease agreements for its gaming machines. Amounts paid in connection with the development agreements are repaid to the Company in accordance with the terms of the agreement, whereas placements fees are not reimbursed. Amounts paid against the placement fee agreements with payment terms greater than 90 days are disclosed in the financing activities section of the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Amounts paid for the placement fee agreements with the agreement terms less than 90 days, are disclosed in the investing activities section of the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
 
 For development agreements in the form of a loan, interest income is recognized on the repayment of the notes based on the stated rate or, if not stated explicitly in the development agreement, on an imputed interest rate. If the stated interest rate is deemed to be other than a market rate or zero, a discount is recorded on the note receivable as a result of the difference between the stated and market rate and a corresponding intangible asset is recorded. The intangible asset is recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements as a contract right under development agreement and amortized as a reduction in revenue over the term of the agreement. Placement fees can be in the form of cash paid upfront or free lease periods and are accreted over the life of the contract and the expense is recorded as a reduction of revenue. We recorded a reduction of gaming operations revenue from the accretion of contract rights under development agreements and placement fees of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. We recorded a reduction of gaming operations revenue from the accretion of contract rights under development agreements and placement fees of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

First Lien Credit Facilities 
 
 On February 15, 2022, AP Gaming I, LLC (the Borrower ), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company and AP Gaming Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company Holdings entered into the Amended Credit Agreement with certain of the Borrower s subsidiaries, the lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent (the Amended Credit Agreement ). The Amended Credit Agreement amends and restates the existing credit agreement, among the Borrower, Holdings, the lenders party thereto from time to time, the Administrative Agent and the other parties named therein. 
 
 The Borrower is a direct subsidiary of AP Gaming Holdings, LLC, which is a direct subsidiary of AP Gaming, Inc., which is a direct subsidiary the Company. These entities between the Borrower and the Company are holding companies with no other operations, cash flows, material assets or liabilities other than the equity interests in the Borrower. 
 
 The Amended Credit Agreement provides (i) a senior secured first lien term loan in an aggregate principal amount of million (the New Term Loan Facility ), the proceeds of which, together with cash on hand of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, were used by the Borrower to repay all amounts outstanding under the existing term loan facilities and to pay related fees and expenses, and (ii) a million senior secured first lien revolving facility, with a million letter of credit subfacility and a million swingline subfacility (the New Revolving Credit Facility ). 
 
 Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Borrower s election, either (a) an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") for the interest period in effect, subject to a floor of (i) in the case of term loan borrowings, 0.75 and (ii) in the case of revolver borrowings, or (b) a base rate determined by the highest of (i) the prime rate in effect, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus and (iii) an adjusted term SOFR with an interest period of one month plus , in each case plus an applicable margin of for adjusted term SOFR loans and for base rate loans. 
 
 The New Term Loan Facility will mature on February 15, 2029 and amortizes in quarterly installments equal to of the original aggregate principal amount of the term loans, with the balance due at maturity. The commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on February 15, 2027. 
 
 The Borrower may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Amended Credit Agreement at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty, except in connection with a repricing event in respect of the New Term Loan Facility, subject to customary breakage costs with respect to adjusted term SOFR loans. 
 
 The Amended Credit Agreement includes customary mandatory prepayment events, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default. In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility requires the Borrower to comply on a quarterly basis, with a maximum net first lien senior secured leverage ratio of to 1.00 if the aggregate amount of funded loans and issued letters of credit (excluding up to million of undrawn letters of credit under the New Revolving Credit Facility and letters of credit that are cash collateralized) under the New Revolving Credit Facility on such date exceeds of the then-outstanding commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 On February 5, 2024 , the Borrower and Holdings, entered into an amendment (the Seventh Amendment to amend that certain First Lien Credit Agreement, dated as of June 6, 2017 (as amended on December 6, 2017 , as amended and restated on February 7, 2018 , as amended and restated as of October 5, 2018 , as amended as of August 30, 2019 , as amended and restated on May 1, 2020 , as amended as of August 4, 2021 , as amended and restated as of February 15, 2022 ), among the Borrower, Holdings, the lenders party thereto from time to time, Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent, and the other parties named therein (as so amended, the Amended Credit Agreement ). 
 
 Among other things, the Seventh Amendment (i) removes the credit spread adjustment with respect to term loan borrowings in Term SOFR (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and (ii) reduces the Applicable Margin (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) on the Borrower s existing term loan to for Term SOFR borrowings and for ABR (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) borrowings. Additionally, in conjunction with entry into the Seventh Amendment, the Company elected to repay million of its total debt outstanding. 
 
 An additional million in loan costs including the write-off of deferred loan costs and third -party costs were incurred related to the Seventh Amendment. Given the composition of the lender group, the transaction was accounted for as a debt modification for existing lenders. As a result of the Seventh Amendment, million in costs were expensed and included in the loss on extinguishment and modification of debt. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , there were no required financial covenants for our debt instruments.

 On April 28, 2014 , our board of directors approved the 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP ). Under the LTIP, the Company is authorized to grant nonqualified stock options, rights to purchase shares of common stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other awards to be settled in, or based upon, shares of common stock to persons who are directors and employees of and consultants to the Company or any of its subsidiaries on the date of the grant. In April 2024 , the LTIP terminated and any remaining awards that were available for grant in the LTIP were cancelled. The LTIP remains active as to previously granted awards until such time that the awards vest, or are exercised in the case of stock options. 
 
 On January 16, 2018 , our board of directors adopted and our stockholders approved the Omnibus Incentive Plan pursuant to which equity-based and cash incentives may be granted to participating employees, directors and consultants. On May 8, 2020 , our board of directors approved an amendment to the Omnibus Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance thereunder from shares to shares, an increase of shares (the 2020 Plan Amendment ), which was approved by the stockholders on July 1, 2020 at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
 
 On April 28, 2022 , our board of directors approved an amendment to the Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended by the 2020 Plan Amendment, to increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance thereunder from shares to shares, an increase of shares (the 2022 Plan Amendment ), which was approved by the stockholders on July 1, 2022 at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. As a result of the 2022 Plan Amendment, awards that were previously accounted for as liability awards were reclassified to equity as they are expected to be settled with equity. Prior to the 2022 Plan Amendment, there were insufficient shares available to settle the liability awards with equity. As of September 30, 2024 , we had shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan.

Stock Options 
 
 The Company calculates the grant date fair value of stock options that vest over a service period using the Black Scholes model. For stock options and other stock awards that contain a market condition related to the return on investment that the Company s stockholders achieve or obtaining a certain stock price, the awards are valued using a lattice-based valuation model. The assumptions used in these calculations are the expected dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected term (in years). Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from comparable companies. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for a term equivalent to the estimated time to liquidity. There were options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Stock option awards represent options to purchase common stock and are granted pursuant to the Company s incentive plans, and include options that the Company primarily classifies as Tranche A or time based, Tranche B and Tranche C. 
 
 Tranche A or time-based options are eligible to vest in equal installments of or on each of the first five or four anniversaries of the date of the grant, subject to continued employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. In the event of a termination of employment without cause or as a result of death or disability, any such time-based options which would have vested on the next applicable vesting date shall become vested, and the remaining unvested time-based options shall be forfeited. In addition, upon a Change in Control (as defined in the incentive plans), subject to continued employment through the date of the Change in Control, all outstanding unvested time-based options shall immediately vest. An initial public offering does not qualify as a Change in Control as it relates to the vesting of stock options. 
 
 All other option awards, comprised of Tranche B and Tranche C, are eligible to vest upon the satisfaction of certain performance conditions (collectively, Performance Options ). These performance conditions included the achievement of investor returns or common stock trading prices. These performance conditions were achieved in October of 2018 for all Performance Options that have been granted and there are currently Performance Options exercisable and outstanding.

Restricted Stock Units 
 
 Restricted stock units are typically eligible to vest in equal installments of on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of the grant, subject to continued employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. In the event of a termination of employment without cause or as a result of death or disability, any such unvested time-based awards shall become vested. In the event of a change in control, certain awards vest immediately and certain awards vest only upon termination within 12 months of the change in control event. 
 
 Certain restricted stock units are eligible to vest upon the satisfaction of certain performance conditions. Vesting occurs on the first day that the average price per share of our common stock for a specified number of consecutive trading days exceeds certain stock price targets, subject to continued employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. The performance-based restricted stock units will be forfeited if the performance target is not achieved within a specified number of years from the grant date. 
 
 In April 2024 , the Company granted restricted stock awards that are scheduled to vest in three years from the grant date and the number of shares that will vest, varies based on a 20 -day average of the stock price ending on the three year anniversary of the grant date (the "Ending Average Price") compared to the average trading price of our common stock for the 20 days beginning on March 15, 2024 (the "Beginning Average Price"). The value of the awards will be million if the Ending Average Price is equal to 25 greater than the Beginning Average Price, which is the "Target Share Price". The number of shares to be issued upon vesting will be determined according to a linear interpolation between a minimum of 40 below the Target Share Price in which of the shares will be issued and a maximum of 60 above the Target Share Price in which of the shares will be issued, which maximum numbers of shares is . These awards are not included in the table below.

Phantom Stock Units 
 
 Phantom stock units are typically eligible to vest in equal installments of on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of the grant, subject to continued employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. In the event of a termination of employment without cause upon or as a result of death or disability, any such unvested units shall become vested. In the event of a change in control, certain awards vest immediately and certain awards vest only upon termination within 12 months of the change in control event. The phantom stock units outstanding at the end of the period may be settled in cash or stock at the Company s discretion. The phantom stock units that the Company intends to settle in cash are accounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period until they become vested with compensation expense being recognized over the requisite service period. The liability associated with such awards is included in Accrued Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All other stock-based awards are classified as equity. 
 
 Certain phantom stock units are eligible to vest upon the satisfaction of certain performance conditions. Vesting occurs on the first day that the average price per share of our common stock for a specified number of trading days exceeds certain stock price targets, subject to continued employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. The performance-based phantom stock units will be forfeited if the performance target is not achieved within a specified number of years from the grant date.

The difference between the federal statutory rate of and the Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , is primarily due to offsetting changes in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and other permanent differences including nondeductible executive compensation. The Company's effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was an expense of . The difference between the federal statutory rate of and the Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to changes in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for certain uncertain tax positions and U.S. tax on foreign income. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company concluded that a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets was appropriate. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. However, based on the Company's recent earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that, in the near future, sufficient positive evidence could justify releasing a portion of this valuation allowance. Such a release would benefit the income tax provision for the period in which it is recorded and could materially impact net income in that period. The timing and amount of the potential valuation allowance release are subject to significant management judgment, as well as prospective earnings in the U.S. 

claims in the second amended complaint including all claims under the Securities Act but the court carved out from the dismissal a scheme liability claim under Section 10 (b), brought only against the Company, David Lopez, and Kimo Akiona, which the court felt was insufficiently briefed. The lead plaintiff was granted leave to file a further amended complaint but chose not to, and instead sought to move forward on the sole remaining scheme liability claim. 
 
 On January 17, 2023, the Company, Mr. Lopez, and Mr. Akiona filed an answer to the remaining claim, along with a motion to temporarily stay discovery and a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the legal findings contained in the court s December 2, 2022 decision require dismissal of the scheme liability claim as well and termination of the action. Those motions were fully briefed as of March 22, 2023. On March 23, 2023, the Court decided the motion to temporarily stay discovery in favor of the defendants, holding that all discovery was stayed pending resolution of the motion for judgment on the pleadings. On February 13, 2024, the Court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the securities class action in full with prejudice. On March 14, 2024 , Plaintiff's filed a notice of appeal. On May 2, 2024 the Plaintiff/Appellant filed an appeal brief. On July 26, 2024 the Company filed its responsive brief. On September 24, 2024, Plaintiff/Appellant filed its reply brief in further support of its appeal. The Ninth Circuit has indicated that it intends to hear oral argument in the first few months of 2025, but no date has yet been set. The defendants will continue to defend vigorously against these claims, but there can be no assurances as to the outcome. 
 
 Derivative Shareholder Lawsuit 
 
 On March 18, 2022, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court by putative stockholder, Manjan Chowdhury, allegedly on behalf of the Company, that piggy-backs on the consolidated securities class action referenced above and is currently pending before the Court. The derivative complaint names David Lopez, Kimo Akiona, and members of the Board as defendants, and generally alleges that they breached their fiduciary duties by causing or failing to prevent the same allegedly false and misleading statements asserted in the securities class action. The derivative complaint also alleges claims for contribution against Mr. Lopez and Mr. Akiona under Sections 10 (b) and 21D of the Exchange Act. On June 9, 2022, the court stayed the derivative action, pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action. On January 27, 2023, at the request of the parties, the court ordered that the derivative action remain stayed pending resolution of the motion for judgment on the pleadings in the securities class action. The Company and the individual defendants intend to defend vigorously against these claims, but there can be no assurances as to the outcome. 
 
 At this time, we are unable to estimate the probability or the amount of liability, if any, related to the securities class action or the shareholder derivative matter. 
 
 Alabama Department of Revenue 
 
 In January 2021, we obtained the results of an audit conducted by the Alabama Department of Revenue ADOR ), in which the ADOR assessed million including interest in unpaid state and local rental taxes on participation revenues and licensing fees that we received from the leasing of EGMs to a Native American tribe in the state of Alabama in the period from May 2016 through August 2019. ADOR claims that such revenues constitute a lease rental payment and are deemed taxable in nature even in situations involving Native American tribe lessees. 
 
 We believe that we were not required to collect and remit Alabama state and local lease/rental tax on our leases of EGMs in the state as those leases are on federally designated Indian land and because federal Indian trading laws and Indian gaming laws, as well as the U.S. Constitution, preempt application of the rental tax to these transactions with the Native American tribe. We have disputed ADOR s audit findings in accordance with applicable state and local tax procedures and ADOR rules. 
 
 In the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we accrued million related to this matter as we have entered into settlement discussions with ADOR. This amount represented the bottom end of the range of probable settlement outcomes and at that time, no other amount was more likely to represent the amount for which the matter would settle. In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our customer in the state of Alabama agreed to reimburse us in full for any amounts that we pay to the state related to this rental tax. Because of this agreement and our customer's encouragement to pay the tax, we paid the ADOR the full assessment and accrued interest, which totaled million. Our customer reimbursed us in full in September 2024. While we cannot reasonably calculate the amount that ADOR would assess for the revenues subsequent to August 2019 due to the types of revenues and rates that apply and as no assessment has been made, based solely on the amount assessed for the period from May 2016 through August 2019, we estimate that ADOR s assessment for taxable lease rental payments for subsequent periods through September 30, 2024 would not exceed million, excluding interest. We have not accrued any amount related to the subsequent periods and it is not probable of payment. There is no assurance that ADOR will assess our revenues from subsequent periods or that such assessment will not materially differ from our estimate. 
 
 North American Free Trade Agreement 
 
 In May 2023, we obtained the initial results of an audit conducted by Servicio de Administracion Tributaria SAT regarding the compliance of our EGMs imported into Mexico with the requirements of the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA ). SAT has concluded that EGMs we imported during certain periods do not comply with their documentation standards to demonstrate compliance with NAFTA and that therefore certain taxes were omitted when the machines were imported. 
 
 In December 2023 , we entered into discussions with SAT and the Mexican taxpayer advocate, Procuradur a de la Defensa del Contribuyente, to reach an agreement with SAT regarding its final assessment which we expected to receive during these discussions. The discussions concluded in January 2024 with no resolution of the matter and with no fixed amount of the potential assessment. In February 2024, SAT made an assessment of the omitted taxes together with interest, fines, and surcharges of approximately million, which has been translated into US dollars at the quarter end exchange rate. We believe that the EGMs qualify under NAFTA and that the documentation we have provided to SAT has been sufficient to demonstrate this qualification. We also believe that SAT has not conducted its audit in compliance with Mexican law and regulations. Therefore, we have filed nullity petitions before the Federal Tax Court in Mexico to invalidate SAT s resolutions in this matter. 
 
 We have not accrued any amount related to this matter, as we cannot accurately estimate the potential loss within the range of up to million, including the possibility of the full reduction of the assessment based on our petitions. 
 
 Demand Letters 
 
 On July 1, 2024 , we filed a definitive proxy statement (the proxy statement with the SEC, and mailed the proxy statement to our stockholders commencing on July 1, 2024 , relating to the Merger Agreement described in Note 14 below. Since the initial filing of the proxy statement, we have received several demand letters from purported stockholders of the Company challenging certain disclosures in the proxy statement and generally requesting that certain allegedly omitted information be disclosed (collectively, the Demand Letters ). Purported stockholders have also filed two lawsuits, Fleming v. PlayAGS, Inc. et al. , Case No. tc240723 - 34 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) and Miller v. PlayAGS, Inc. et al. , Case No. tc240724 - 11 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.), challenging certain disclosures in the proxy statement under New York state law and generally requesting that certain allegedly omitted information be disclosed (the Complaints ). The Complaints name the Company and the Company s directors, among others as defendants. While we believe that the disclosures set forth in the proxy statement comply fully with all applicable law and deny the allegations in the Demand Letters and the Complaints, in order to moot plaintiffs disclosure claims, avoid nuisance and possible expense and business delays, and provide additional information to our stockholders, we determined to voluntarily supplement certain disclosures in the proxy statement related to the purported stockholders claims. 
 
 At this time, we are unable to estimate the probability or the amount of liability, if any, related to the Demand Letters or the Complaints.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a leading designer and supplier of EGMs and other products and services for the gaming industry. We operate our business in three distinct segments: EGMs, Table Products and Interactive. Each segment's activities include the design, development, acquisition, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, installation and servicing of a distinct product line. Founded in 2005, we historically focused on supplying EGMs, including slot machines, video bingo machines, and other electronic gaming devices, to the Native American gaming market. Since 2014, we have expanded our product line-up to include: (i) Class III EGMs for commercial and Native American casinos permitted to operate Class III EGMs, (ii) EGMs that use the results of historical horse races ("HHR") in their game math, which are allowed in several niche markets and raceways, (iii) table game products and (iv) interactive products, all of which we believe provide us with growth opportunities as we expand in markets where we currently have limited or no presence. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 63 and 64 of our total revenue, respectively, was generated through recurring contracted lease agreements whereby we place EGMs and table game products at our customers gaming facilities under either a revenue sharing agreement (we receive a percentage of the revenues that these products generate) or fee-per-day agreement (we receive a daily or monthly fixed fee per EGM or table game product), or recurring revenue from our Interactive gaming operations. 
 
 On May 8, 2024 , the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Bingo Holdings I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Parent ), and Bingo Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent Merger Sub ), providing for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the Merger with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub were formed by affiliates of Brightstar Capital Partners. 
 
 Upon the closing of the Merger, each share of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (except for shares: (A) held by the Company (including in the Company s treasury) or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company; or (B) held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, which will be cancelled and retired for no consideration) will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive 12.50 in cash. 
 
 Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including but not limited to: (i) the approval of the Merger by a majority of the Company s stockholders, which was obtained on August 6, 2024 , (ii) expiration or termination of any waiting periods applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, (iii) absence of any legal requirement, order or injunction enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and (iv) receipt of certain gaming regulatory approvals and gaming licenses. The Merger is expected to be completed in the second half of calendar year 2025. 

EGM Segment 
 
 EGMs constitute our largest segment, representing 89 and 90 of our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. In 2024, we had a library of over 550 proprietary game titles that we offer for delivery on our EGM cabinets. These include our premium lease-only cabinets Orion Starwall , Orion Curve Premium , Orion Rise, Big Red , Spectra UR43 Premium, and the recent addition Spectra SL75+ . Our core cabinets that are available for sale and lease include Spectra UR49C , Spectra UR43, Orion Portrait , Orion Slant, Orion Curve , Orion Upright , ICON, and the recent addition Spectra SL49+ . In 2024, we released our first three-reel stepper Revel, entering AGS into the mechanical reel category. In addition to providing complete EGM units, we offer conversion kits, which are essentially software containing new games that allow existing game titles to be converted to other game titles offered within that operating platform and on an existing cabinet. 
 
 We design all of our cabinets with the intention of capturing the attention of players on casino floors while aiming to maximize operator profits. We offer our customers the option of either leasing or purchasing our EGMs and associated gaming systems. Currently, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from EGMs installed under revenue sharing or fee-per-day lease agreements, also known as participation agreements, and we refer to such revenue generation as our participation model . 
 
 Our core game titles are targeted at maintaining and growing our current installed base and we believe that it is the performance of these game titles that our customers value. Our top-performing game titles include Triple Coin Treasures, Rakin' Bacon!, and a version used only on our premium games called Rakin' Bacon Deluxe . In addition to these titles, we have hundreds of additional titles that we design our core titles to provide a universal appeal to casino patrons. Our game studios are focused on continually producing new content that is then released to the market on a regular basis.

Revenues 
 
 Gaming Operations. 
 
 Gaming operations revenue increased primarily due to an increase in our domestic Interactive segment, which increased by 2.8 million compared to the prior year. The increase in gaming operations revenue is also attributable to our Tables segment, which increased by 0.3 million compared to the prior year, offset by a decrease of 1.7 million in our EGMs segment primarily due to the decrease of 1.19 in revenue per day. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, EGM revenue per day was 25.09, compared to 26.28 in the prior year period. 
 
 Equipment Sales. 
 
 The increase in equipment sales was primarily due to an increase of 296 EGMs sold year over year. We sold 1,641 EGM units during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 1,345 EGM units in the prior year period. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Cost of gaming operations. The increase in the cost of gaming operations was primarily due to an increase in direct expenses and related costs, offset by a decrease in field service and support. As a percentage of gaming operations revenue, costs of gaming operations was 21.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.7 for the prior year period.

Table of Contents 

Cost of equipment sales. The i ncrease in cost of equipment sales is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of units sold compared to the prior year period. As a percentage of equipment sales revenue, costs of equipment sales was 46.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 47.8 for the prior year period, which fluctuated year over year primarily due to a change in the mix of products sold between periods. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to a 1.2 million decrease in salaries benefits, along with a 1.0 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation in the current period. The decrease is offset by a 1.4 million increase in professional and legal fees related to the Merger and operating costs that support our business. 
 
 Research and development. The increase is primarily attributable to a 1.8 million increase in salaries and benefits. 
 
 Write-downs and other charges. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized 0.6 million in write-downs and other charges primarily related to disposal of long-lived assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company did not recognize any significant write-downs and other charges. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization. The increase was predominantly due to a 1.0 million increase in amortization. 
 
 Other expense (income) 
 
 Interest expense. The decrease in interest expense is predominantly attributable to a decreased interest rate in the current period as compared to the prior year period which was the result of the repricing of the term loan credit facility in the current year by entering into the Seventh Amendment as well as the decrease in debt principal outstanding. See Item 1."Financial Statements" Note 5."Long-Term Debt" for a detailed discussion regarding long-term debt . 
 
 Other expense (income). The fluctuation is due to the effect of foreign currency fluctuation on trade payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. 
 
 Income taxes. The Company's effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , was an expense of 32.5 . The difference between the federal statutory rate of 21.0 and the Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , is primarily due to changes in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and other permanent differences including nondeductible executive compensation. The Company's effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was an expense of 119.9 . The difference between the federal statutory rate of 21.0 and the Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to changes in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and US tax on foreign income.

Revenues 
 
 Gaming Operations. 
 
 Gaming operations revenue increased primarily due to an increase in our domestic Interactive segment, which increased by 6.5 million compared to the prior year. The increase in gaming operations revenue is also attributable to an increase in our Tables segment, which increased by 0.9 million primarily due to the increase of 196 units installed compared to the prior year, offset by a 0.1 million decrease in our EGMs segment primarily due to the decrease of 0.43 in revenue per day. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, EGM revenue per day was 25.93, compared to 26.36 in the prior year period. 
 
 Equipment Sales. 
 
 The increase in equipment sales was primarily due to an increase of 737 EGMs sold year over year. We sold 4,462 EGM units during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 3,725 EGM units in the prior year period. The increase in equipment sales is also attributed to the sale of previously leased EGMs to distributors in the current period. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Cost of gaming operations. The increase in the cost of gaming operations was primarily the result of increased field service and support due to increased activity, offset by decreased direct expenses and related costs compared to the prior year period. As a percentage of gaming operations revenue, costs of gaming operations was 20.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.5 for the prior year period.

Cost of equipment sales. The increase in cost of equipment sales is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of units sold compared to the prior year period. As a percentage of equipment sales revenue, costs of equipment sales was 46.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 47.5 for the prior year period, which fluctuated year over year primarily due to a change in the mix of products sold between periods. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to a 5.8 million increase in the current period in professional and legal fees primarily related to the Merger, the remainder of the increase is attributable to operating costs that support our business. The increase is offset by a 2.5 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation as well as a 1.0 million decrease in salaries and benefits. 
 
 Research and development. The increase is primarily attributable to a 2.3 million increase in salaries and benefits, 0.4 million increase in professional fees, as well as a 0.3 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation. The increase is offset by 0.3 million decrease in development costs. 
 
 Write-downs and other charges. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized 0.7 million in write-downs and other charges primarily related to the disposal of long-lived assets and impairment of intangible assets (the Company used level 3 fair value inputs based on projected cash flows). During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized 0.6 million in write-downs and other charges primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets and the disposal of long-lived assets. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization. The increase was predominantly due to a 2.7 million increase in amortization, offset by a 0.2 million decrease in depreciation. 
 
 Other expense (income) 
 
 Interest expense. The decrease in interest expense is predominantly attributable to a decreased interest rate in the current period as compared to the prior year period which was the result of the repricing of the term loan credit facility in the current year by entering into the Seventh Amendment as well as the decrease in debt principal outstanding. See Item 1."Financial Statements" Note 5."Long-Term Debt" for a detailed discussion regarding long-term debt . 
 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt. On February 5, 2024 , in connection with entering into the Seventh Amendment, 1.6 million in loan costs related to third-party costs were expensed and included in the loss on extinguishment and modification of debt. 
 
 Other expense (income). The fluctuation is due to the effect of foreign currency fluctuation on trade payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. 
 
 Income taxes. The Company's effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was an expense of 21.2 . The difference between the federal statutory rate of 21.0 and the Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , is primarily due to offsetting changes in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and other permanent differences including nondeductible executive compensation. The Company's effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was an expense of 39.5 . The difference between the federal statutory rate of 21.0 and the Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to changes in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for certain uncertain tax positions and U.S. tax on foreign income.

Segment Operating Results 
 
 We report our business segment results by segment in accordance with the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by our chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, for making decisions and assessing performance of our reportable segments. 
 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 1. "Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for a detailed discussion of our three segments. Each segment s activities include the design, development, acquisition, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, installation and servicing of its product lines. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on revenues and segment Adjusted EBITDA. 
 
 Segment revenues include leasing, licensing or selling of products within each reportable segment. We measure segment performance in terms of revenue, segment-specific Adjusted EBITDA and unit placements. We believe that unit placements are an important gauge of segment performance for EGM s and Table Products because it measures historical market placements of leased and sold units and provides insight into potential markets for next-generation products and service. We do not present a sold unit cumulative installed base as previously sold units may no longer be in use by our customers or may have been replaced by other models or products. 
 
 Adjusted Expenses 
 
 We have provided (i) adjusted cost of gaming operations, (ii) adjusted selling, general and administrative costs and (iii) adjusted research and development cost (collectively, the Adjusted Expenses in this Form 10-Q because we believe such measure provides investors with additional information to measure our performance. 
 
 We believe that the presentation of each of the Adjusted Expenses is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items that vary greatly and are difficult to predict. These Adjusted Expenses take into account non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisitions and integration related costs including restructuring and severance, initial and secondary public offering costs, legal and litigation expenses including settlement payments, new jurisdictions and regulatory licensing costs, non-cash charges on capitalized installation and delivery, non-cash charges and (gain) loss on disposition of assets and other adjustments that include costs and inventory and receivable valuation charges. Further, we believe each of the Adjusted Expenses provides a meaningful measure of our expenses because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. It also provides management and investors with additional information to estimate our value. 
 
 Each of the Adjusted Expenses is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP. Our use of the term Adjusted Expenses may vary from others in our industry. Each of the Adjusted Expenses should not be considered as an alternative to our operating expenses under GAAP. Each of the Adjusted Expenses has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 
 
 Our definition of Adjusted Expenses allows us to add back certain non-cash charges that are deducted in calculating net loss and to deduct certain gains that are included in calculating net loss. However, these expenses and gains vary greatly, and are difficult to predict. They can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. In addition, in the case of charges or expenses, these items can represent the reduction of cash that could be used for other corporate purposes. 
 
 Due to these limitations, we rely primarily on our GAAP cost of gaming operations, cost of equipment sales, selling, general and administrative costs and research and development costs and use each of the Adjusted Expenses only supplementally. 
 
 The tables below present each of the Adjusted Expenses and include a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure.

Gaming Operations Revenue 
 
 The increase in Table Products gaming operations revenue is attributable to the increase of 196 Table Products installed base compared to the prior year period. Our installed base was 5,505 units in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 5,309 units in the prior year period. 
 
 Equipment Sales 
 
 The decrease in equipment sales is primarily due to the sale of fewer Pax S single-deck shufflers in the current period as compared to the prior year period, offset by an increase in sales of Dex S shufflers at lower average selling prices. 
 
 Tables Products Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Table Products Adjusted EBITDA includes the revenues and operating expenses from the Table Products segment adjusted for depreciation, amortization, write-downs and other charges, severance and restructuring, as well as other costs. See Item 1. Financial Statements Note 13. "Operating Segments" for further explanation of adjustments. The increase in Table Products Adjusted EBITDA is attributable to the increase in revenue as described above and decrease in research and development related expenses.

 TOTAL ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION TO NET INCOME (LOSS) 
 
 We have provided total Adjusted EBITDA in this Form 10-Q because we believe such measure provides investors with additional information to measure our performance. 
 
 We believe that the presentation of total Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Further, we believe total Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. It also provides management and investors with additional information to estimate our value. 
 
 Total Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP. Our use of the term total Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in our industry. Total Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss) or net income (loss). Total Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 
 
 Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA allows us to add back certain non-cash charges that are deducted in calculating net loss and to deduct certain gains that are included in calculating net income. However, these expenses and gains vary greatly, and are difficult to predict. They can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. In addition, in the case of charges or expenses, these items can represent the reduction of cash that could be used for other corporate purposes. 
 
 Due to these limitations, we rely primarily on our GAAP results, such as net income (loss), income from operations, EGM Adjusted EBITDA, Table Products Adjusted EBITDA or Interactive Adjusted EBITDA, and use Total Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 We expect that primary ongoing liquidity requirements for the next twelve months after the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued will be for operating capital expenditures, working capital, debt servicing, game development and other customer acquisition activities. We expect to finance these liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand, additional financing, and cash flows from operating activities. 
 
 Part of our overall strategy includes consideration of expansion opportunities into underserved markets and acquisition and other strategic opportunities that may arise periodically. We may require additional funds in order to execute on such strategic growth and may incur additional debt or issue additional equity to finance any such transactions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such debt or issue any such additional equity on acceptable terms or at all. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had 45.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and 40.0 million available to draw under its revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024 , management believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its operating requirements and meet its obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months after the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued.

 The increase in cash provided by operating activities is attributable to a 13.0 million increase provided by assets and liabilities that relate to operations, the increase is further supported by an improvement in our net income adjusted for non-cash expenses that increased by 7.2 million. 
 
 Investing activities 
 
 The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a 8.7 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, 1.0 million increase in software development and other expenditures. In the prior year, we collected 3.1 million from customer notes receivable which is not present in the current year. 
 
 Financing activities 
 
 The increase in cash used in financing activities of 19.5 million is primarily attributable to the reduction of debt principal due to the voluntary payment of 15.0 million in the current period, 4.3 million increase in repurchases of stock related to net share settling of employee equity awards, as well as an increase of 1.7 million in payments on finance leases and other obligations, offset by a 1.4 million increase in proceeds from stock option exercise.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "Annual Report") includes a discussion of our risk factors. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. The Company is supplementing its risk factors described in the Annual Report and the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other risk factors disclosed in the Annual Report. 
 
 Risks Related to the Proposed Merger 
 
 The announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by Brightstar Capital Partners may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and our stock price, and may result in the loss of employees, customers, suppliers, and other business partners. 
 
 On May 8, 2024 , the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Bingo Holdings I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Parent ), and Bingo Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent Merger Sub ), providing for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the Merger with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub were formed by affiliates of Brightstar Capital Partners. We are subject to risks in connection with the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including, but not limited to, the following: 

market reaction to the announcement of the Merger; 

changes in our business, operations, financial position, and prospects; 

market assessments of the likelihood that the Merger will be consummated; 

the amount of cash offered per share will not be increased to account for positive changes in our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition, or results of operations during the pendency of the Merger, including any successful execution of our current strategy as an independent company or in the event of any change in the market price of, analyst estimates of, or projections relating to, our common stock; 

potential adverse effects on our relationships with our current customers, suppliers and other business; partners, or those with which we are seeking to establish business relationships, due to uncertainties about the Merger; 

we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether the Merger is consummated; 

potential adverse effects on our ability to attract, recruit, retain, and motivate current and prospective employees who may be uncertain about their future roles and relationships with us following the completion of the Merger, and the possibility that our employees could lose productivity as a result of uncertainty regarding their employment following the Merger; 

the pendency and outcome of the legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against us, our directors, executive officers and others relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and 

the possibility of disruption to our business, including increased costs and diversion of management time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us. 

While the Merger is pending, we are subject to contractual restrictions that could harm our business, operating results and our stock price. 
 
 The Merger Agreement includes restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Merger, generally requiring us to conduct our businesses in the ordinary course in all material respects, and restricting us from taking certain specified actions absent Brightstar Capital Partners prior written consent. We may find that these and other obligations in the Merger Agreement may delay or prevent us from responding, or limit our ability to respond, effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future business opportunities that may arise during such period. These restrictions could adversely impact our business, operating results and our stock price and our perceived acquisition value, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. 
 
 The failure to complete the Merger may adversely affect our business and our stock price. 
 
 The Merger with Brightstar Capital Partners is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, (i) the Company s receipt of the approval of Company stockholders representing a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares; (ii) expiration or termination of any waiting periods applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976; (iii) absence of any legal requirement, order or injunction enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger; and (iv) receipt of certain gaming regulatory approvals and gaming licenses. There can be no assurance that these conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied, or that the Merger will be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all. If the Merger is not completed, we may be subject to negative publicity or be negatively perceived by the investment or business communities and our stock price could fall to the extent that our current stock price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed. Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business and results of our operations. 
 
 The Merger Agreement with Brightstar Capital Partners limits our ability to pursue alternative transactions which could deter a third party from proposing an alternative transaction. 
 
 The Merger Agreement contains provisions that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly facilitate, or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any acquisition proposal or any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal, or (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or afford access to any other person any non-public information relating to the Company or its business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, among other prohibitions. It is possible that these or other provisions in the Merger Agreement might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of our outstanding common stock from considering or proposing an acquisition or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire our common stock than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.
