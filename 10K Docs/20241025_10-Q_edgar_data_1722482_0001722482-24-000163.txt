 Our impairment test was performed as of June 30, 2023 and utilized our then latest estimates of Ritter s projected cash flows, including revenues, gross margin, SG A expenses, capital expenditures to maintain the acquired assets, and investments in debt free net working capital, as well as current market assumptions for the discount rate. 
 We have not identified any further events or changes in circumstances that would indicate a potential inability to recover the remaining carrying amounts of the Ritter asset group following the recognition of the impairment charges in the second quarter of 2023.

 million, which is calculated based on expected cash payments discounted at rates ranging from to between 2024 and 2045. The undiscounted amount of that obligation is million. We are indemnified against any losses incurred in this matter as stipulated through the agreement and guaranty referenced in our Annual Report. 
 In 2016, we assessed the environmental condition of our chemical manufacturing site in Gliwice, Poland. Our assessment revealed specific types of soil and groundwater contamination throughout the site. We are also monitoring the condition of a closed landfill on that site. These matters are not covered by our indemnification arrangement because they relate to an operation we subsequently acquired. At September 30, 2024, our balance sheet includes a liability of million for remediation and monitoring costs. That liability is estimated primarily on discounted expected remediation payments and is not materially different from its undiscounted amount. 
 Manufacture and sale of products 
 Our business involves risk of product liability, patent infringement and other claims in the ordinary course of business arising from the products that we produce ourselves or obtain from our suppliers, as well as from the services we provide. Our exposure to such claims may increase to the extent that we expand our manufacturing operations or service offerings. 
 We maintain insurance policies to protect us against these risks, including product liability insurance. In many cases the suppliers of products we distribute have indemnified us against such claims. Our insurance coverage or indemnification agreements with suppliers may not be adequate in all pending or any future cases brought against us. Furthermore, our ability to recover under any insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of our insurers, our suppliers and our suppliers insurers, as well as legal enforcement under the local laws governing the arrangements. 
 We have entered into indemnification agreements with customers of our self-manufactured products to protect them from liabilities and losses arising from our negligence, willful misconduct or sale of defective products. To date, we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. 
 Litigation 
 At September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding litigation that we believe would result in material losses if decided against us, and we do not believe that there are any unasserted matters that are reasonably possible to result in a material loss.

 Capacity under the receivables facility is calculated as the lower of eligible borrowing base or facility limit of million. Eligible borrowing base is determined as total available accounts receivable less ineligible accounts receivable and other adjustments. At September 30, 2024, total available accounts receivable under the receivables facility were million. 
 In June 2023, we amended the revolving credit facility to increase its funding limit up to million and extended the term to June 29, 2028. We capitalized million of fees in connection with this transaction. 
 Senior secured credit facilities 
 On April 2, 2024, we amended the credit agreement to reprice the U.S. Dollar term loan under our senior secured credit facilities. Pursuant to the agreement, the interest rate applicable to the U.S. Dollar term loan reduced from SOFR plus a spread of per annum to SOFR plus a spread of per annum. The principal amount of U.S. Dollar term loan outstanding immediately prior to the amendment and the outstanding principal amount of U.S. Dollar term loan immediately following the amendment each totaled million. The final stated maturity of the U.S. Dollar term loan remains November 6, 2027. The costs to complete the amendment were not material. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we made prepayment of million on our Euro term loan B-4 that matures on June 10, 2028. In connection with this prepayment, we expensed million of previously unamortized deferred financing costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 Debt covenants 
 Our debt agreements include representations and covenants that we consider usual and customary, and our receivables facility and senior secured credit facilities include a financial covenant that becomes applicable for periods in which we have drawn more than of our revolving credit facility under the senior secured credit facilities. In this circumstance, we are not permitted to have combined borrowings on our senior secured credit facilities and secured notes in excess of a pro forma net leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreements. As we had not drawn more than of our revolving credit facility in this period, this covenant was not applicable at September 30, 2024.

 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the hedging relationship between our million notional value interest rate swap and underlying hedged item became ineffective as the hedged forecast transaction was deemed no longer probable of occurring. Due to the ineffectiveness, hedge accounting was discontinued, which resulted in a million gain on the hedged transaction to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings. After the hedging relationship was discontinued, we terminated the interest rate swap and monetized million of cash proceeds, which were received in October 2024.

 We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on investments we hold in foreign entities, specifically our net investment in Avantor Holdings B.V., a EUR-functional-currency consolidated subsidiary, against the risk of changes in the EUR-USD exchange rate. 
 For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Amounts are reclassified out of AOCI into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.

 Non-derivative financial instruments which are designated as hedging instruments: 
 We designated all of our outstanding million senior unsecured notes, issued on July 17, 2020, and maturing on July 15, 2028, as a hedge of our net investment in certain of our European operations. For instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the foreign currency transactional gains or losses are reported as a component of AOCI. The gains or losses would be reclassified into earnings upon a liquidation event or deconsolidation of a hedged foreign subsidiary. 
 Net investment hedge effectiveness is assessed based upon the change in the spot rate of the foreign currency denominated debt. The critical terms of the foreign currency notes match the portion of the net investments designated as being hedged. At September 30, 2024, the net investment hedge was equal to the designated portion of the European operations and was considered to be perfectly effective. 
 In October 2024, the Company de-designated these outstanding million senior unsecured notes as a hedge of our net investment in certain of our European operations. The de-designation will have no impact on earnings as the accumulated gain on the net investment hedge is only reclassified into earnings upon a liquidation event or deconsolidation of a hedged foreign subsidiary. 
 The accumulated gain related to the foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges classified in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Item 2. Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
 This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. See Cautionary factors regarding forward-looking statements. 
 
 Basis of presentation 
 This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes. Pursuant to SEC rules for reports covering interim periods, we have prepared this discussion and analysis to enable you to assess material changes in our financial condition and results of operations since December 31, 2023, the date of our Annual Report. Therefore, we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our Annual Report. 
 Overview 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net sales of 1,714.4 million, net income of 57.8 million, Adjusted EBITDA of 302.5 million and Adjusted Operating Income of 274.8 million. Net sales decreased by 0.3 , which included a 0.7 decline in organic sales compared to the same period in 2023. See Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures for reconciliations of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income, and net income margin to Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Operating Income margin. See Results of operations for a reconciliation of net sales growth (decline) to organic net sales growth (decline). 
 Segment Change 
 Effective January 1, 2024, we changed our operating model and reporting segment structure from three reportable segments to two reportable segments, Laboratory Solutions and Bioscience Production. This structure aligns with how our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, measures segment operating performance and allocate resources across our operating segments. This reportable segment change has no impact on our consolidated operating results. 
 In connection with the operating model and reporting structure change, our chief operating decision maker changed the measure used to evaluate segment profitability from Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Operating Income. All disclosures relating to segment profitability, including those for comparative periods, have been revised as a result of this change.

 Factors and current trends affecting our business and results of operations 
 The following updates the factors and current trends disclosed in our Annual Report. These updates may affect our performance and financial condition in future periods. 
 Our business continues to be impacted by the transition from the global coronavirus pandemic 
 Customer demand and required inventory levels continue to normalize in the transition from the COVID-19 pandemic. For a discussion of this trend and associated economic disruptions, and the actual operational and financial impacts that we experienced through December 31, 2023, see Part II, Item 7 Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our Annual Report. 
 We have been impacted by supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures 
 We have experienced inventory fluctuations and build up at customers as a result of global supply chain disruptions and have experienced inflationary pressures across all of our cost categories. While we have implemented pricing and productivity measures to combat these pressures, they may continue to adversely impact our results. 
 We are implementing a cost transformation initiative to reduce our expenses 
 We are advancing a global cost transformation initiative to further enhance productivity through increased organizational efficiency, footprint optimization, reduced cost-to-serve and procurement savings that are expected to generate approximately 300 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2026. 
 Fluctuations in foreign currency rates impact our results 
 Our consolidated results of operations are comprised of many different functional currencies that translate into our U.S. Dollar reporting currency. The movement of the U.S. Dollar against those functional currencies, particularly the Euro, has caused significant variability in our results and may continue to do so in the future. 
 
 Key indicators of performance and financial condition 
 To evaluate our performance, we monitor a number of key indicators. As appropriate, we supplement our results of operations determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial measurements that we believe are useful to investors, creditors and others in assessing our performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported GAAP results because they may include or exclude certain items as compared to similar GAAP-based measures, and such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Rather, these measures should be considered as an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that provide a more complete understanding of our business. 
 The key indicators that we monitor are as follows: 
 Net sales, gross margin, operating income, operating income margin, net income or loss and net income or loss margin . These measures are discussed in the section entitled Results of operations

 Organic net sales growth , which is a non-GAAP measure discussed in the section entitled Results of operations. Organic net sales growth (decline) eliminates from our reported net sales change the impacts of revenues from acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the last year and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that this measurement is useful to investors as a way to measure and evaluate our underlying commercial operating performance consistently across our segments and the periods presented. This measurement is used by our management for the same reason. Reconciliations to the change in reported net sales, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, are included in the section entitled Results of operations 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin , which are non-GAAP measures discussed in the section entitled Results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is our net income or loss adjusted for the following items: (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (iv) depreciation expense, (v) losses on extinguishment of debt, (vi) charges associated with the impairment of certain assets, (vii) and certain other adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales as determined under GAAP. We believe that these measurements are useful as ways to analyze the underlying trends in our business consistently across the periods presented. These measurements are used by our management for the same reason. A reconciliation of net income or loss and net income or loss margin, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, respectively, are included in the section entitled Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures 
 Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income margin , which are non-GAAP measures discussed in the section entitled Results of operations. Adjusted Operating Income is our net income or loss adjusted for the following items: (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (iv) losses on extinguishment of debt, (v) charges associated with the impairment of certain assets, (vi) and certain other adjustments. This measurement is our segment reporting profitability measure under generally accepted accounting principles. Adjusted Operating Income margin is Adjusted Operating Income divided by net sales as determined under GAAP. We believe that these measurements are useful to investors as ways to analyze the underlying trends in our business consistently across the periods presented. These measurements are used by our management for the same reason. A reconciliation of net income or loss and net income or loss margin, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, to Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income margin, respectively, are included in the section entitled Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures 
 Cash flows from operating activities , which we discuss in the section entitled Liquidity and capital resources Historical cash flows 
 Free cash flow , which is a non-GAAP measure, is equal to our cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus the direct costs to close acquisitions and divestitures (including income tax effects, if any) in the period. We believe that this measurement is useful to investors as it provides a view on the Company s ability to generate cash for use in financing or investing activities. This measurement is used by management for the same reason. A reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow, is included in the section entitled Liquidity and capital resources Historical cash flows.

 Results of operations 
 We present results of operations in the same way that we manage our business, evaluate our performance and allocate our resources. We also provide discussion of net sales and Adjusted Operating Income by segment: Laboratory Solutions and Bioscience Production. Corporate costs are managed on a standalone basis, certain of which are allocated to our reportable segments.

 The third quarter net sales decline was driven by decreases in the Bioscience Production segment primarily due to reduced customer demand. Volume declines and inflationary pressures, partially offset by manufacturing productivity, contributed to contraction in gross profit and gross margin. Lower gross profit and the reset of annual incentive compensation, partially offset by savings from our cost transformation initiative, drove Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Operating Income margin contraction.

 Liquidity and capital resources 
 We fund short-term cash requirements primarily from operating cash flows and credit facilities. Most of our long-term financing is from indebtedness. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 244.8 million and 667.5 million of cash from operating activities, respectively, ended the quarter with 285.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and our availability under our credit facilities was 1,066.3 million. We have no debt repayments due in the next twelve months other than required term loan payments of 20.1 million and receivables facility borrowing of 205.1 million.

 Some of our credit line availability depends upon maintaining a sufficient borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient capital resources to meet our liquidity needs. 
 Our debt agreements include representations and covenants that we consider usual and customary, and our receivables facility and senior secured credit facilities include a financial covenant that becomes applicable for periods in which we have drawn more than 35 of our revolving credit facility under the senior secured credit facilities. In this circumstance, we are not permitted to have combined borrowings on our senior secured credit facilities and secured notes in excess of a pro forma net leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreements. As we had not drawn more than 35 of our revolving credit facility in this period, this covenant was not applicable at September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, 257.2 million or 90.2 of our 285.3 million in cash and cash equivalents was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries and may be subject to certain taxes upon repatriation, primarily where foreign withholding taxes apply.

 2. Includes changes to our accounts receivable, inventory, contract assets and accounts payable. 
 Cash flows from operating activities provided 49.1 million more cash in 2024 primarily due to improved working capital and lower outflow of income taxes, partially offset by lower operating income. 
 Investing activities used 25.9 million more cash in 2024. The change was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures compared to the prior year. 
 Financing activities used 133.7 million less cash in 2024 primarily due to the lower repayments of term loans in 2024 compared to 2023 and higher proceeds received from stock options exercises in 2024 compared to the prior year. 
 Free cash flow (in millions) Nine months ended September 30, 
 Change 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 667.5 618.4 49.1 Capital expenditures (121.3) (95.8) (25.5) Free cash flow 546.2 522.6 23.6 
 Free cash flow was 23.6 million higher in 2024 primarily due to higher cash flow from operating activities as previously discussed, partially offset by an increase in capital spending across the Company in 2024 as noted above.
