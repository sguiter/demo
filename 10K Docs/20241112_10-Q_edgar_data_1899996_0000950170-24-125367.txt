CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are current expectations, estimates and projections of Fidelity Private Credit Company LLC (the Fund, we, us or our and/or Fidelity Diversifying Solutions LLC FDS or the Adviser about the Fund, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Fund, we, us or our refers to Fidelity Direct Lending Fund, LP, a Delaware limited partnership for periods prior to consummation of the BDC Conversion (as defined below), refers to Fidelity Private Credit Central Fund LLC, a Delaware limited liability company for periods following the BDC Conversion. BDC Conversion refers to the conversion by operation of law of Fidelity Direct Lending, LP to Fidelity Private Credit Central Fund LLC by the filing of a Certificate of Conversion to a limited liability company on January 31, 2023, and the Fund s subsequent election to be regulated as a BDC. On March 11, 2024, the Fund was renamed Fidelity Private Credit Company LLC. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, seek, expect, anticipate, project, estimate, intend, continue, target, or believe or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. Due to various risks and uncertainties, actual events or results or the actual performance of the Fund may differ materially from those reflected or contemplated in such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 

our ability to raise capital; 

geo-political conditions, including revolution, insurgency, terrorism or war, including those arising out of the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel; 

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

our current and expected financing arrangements and investments; 

changes in the general interest rate environment; 

the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital; 

the timing and amount of cash flows, distributions and dividends, if any, from our portfolio companies; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Adviser and its affiliates; 

the elevating levels of inflation, and its impact on our portfolio companies and on the industries in which we invest; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we may invest; 

the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments; 

the ability of the Adviser to identify suitable investments and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the ability of the Adviser and its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

our ability to maintain our qualification as a business development company BDC and as a regulated investment company RIC under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; 

the impact on our business of U.S. and international financial reform legislation, rules and regulations; 

the effect of changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations thereof; and 

the tax status of the enterprises in which we may invest. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future file with the SEC including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form 10, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Because we are an investment company, the forward-looking statements and projections contained in this report are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Act, as amended (the 1934 Act ).

Prior to September 12, 2024, the applicable margins were per annum for certain advances in British Pounds and per annum for other advances.

Short-Term Borrowings In order to finance certain investment transactions, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into reverse repurchase agreements, whereby the Fund sells to Macquarie Bank Limited an investment that it holds and concurrently enters into an agreement to repurchase the same investment at an agreed-upon purchase price at a future date, generally not to exceed 180-days from the date it was sold (each a Short-Term Financing Transaction ). The net purchase price that the Fund must pay to repurchase an investment includes the original purchase amount paid to the Fund by Macquarie Bank Limited to purchase an investment, a financing fee equivalent to to of the original purchase amount per annum and the value of cash interest payments received by Macquarie Bank Limited on the investment. Securities sold under this arrangement are presented in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , there were short-term borrowings. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 , there were short-term borrowings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were short-term borrowings which bore interest at an average applicable interest rate of per annum. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Fund had outstanding short-term borrowings. In accordance with ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, the Short-Term Financing Transactions meet the criteria for secured borrowings. Accordingly, the investment financed by these agreements remains on the Fund s consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as an asset, and the Fund records a liability to reflect its repurchase obligation, which is reported as debt on the Fund s consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The repurchase obligation is secured by the respective investment that is the subject of the reverse repurchase agreement.

Ite m 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events, our future performance or financial condition and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 The Fund was formed on September 16, 2021 as a Delaware limited partnership and converted to a Delaware limited liability company effective January 31, 2023. The Fund elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC on June 1, 2023 and elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, the Fund is required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of the Fund s assets in qualifying assets, source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of the Fund s taxable income and tax-exempt interest. The Fund is externally managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, determining the value of Fund investments, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Our Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. 
 An externally-managed BDC generally does not have any employees, and its investment and management functions are provided by an outside investment adviser and administrator under an advisory agreement and administration agreement. Instead of directly compensating employees, we pay FDS for investment and management services pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. 
 Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. The Fund will achieve these objectives primarily through directly originated loans to private companies but also liquid credit investments, like broadly syndicated loans, and other select Private Credit investments. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80 of its total assets in Private Credit investments. If the Fund changes its 80 test, the Fund will provide Unit Holders with at least 60 days prior notice of such change. The Adviser may also invest to a lesser degree in equity linked instruments (which may include debt with warrants, preferred equity investments, or equity co-investments). Most of our investments will be in private U.S. operating companies, but (subject to compliance with BDCs requirement to invest at least 70 of its assets in private U.S. companies) we may also invest to a lesser degree in non-U.S. companies. Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other affiliated funds. From time to time, we may co-invest with other affiliated funds. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 The Fund focuses primarily on directly originated loans to private companies but will also invest in liquid credit investments, such as broadly syndicated loans. Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to private companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, trading prices of loans and other securities and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 Revenues 
 The Fund generates revenues in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. Our senior and subordinated debt investments bear interest predominantly at a floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 47 

Expenses 
 The Adviser and/or its affiliates paid, directly or through reimbursement of the Fund, for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the organization of the Fund, including, without limitation, the following: (i) the offering and sale of the Units of the Fund, (ii) the BDC Conversion and the organization of the Fund, (iii) the election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, and (iv) the negotiation, execution and delivery of the LLC Agreement, the Advisory Agreement, Administration Agreement (if any), and any related or similar documents, including, without limitation, any related legal and accounting fees and expenses, printing costs, travel and out-of-pocket expenses and filing fees. 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. The Administrator or its affiliates will bear all fees, costs, and expenses incurred that are not specifically assumed by the Fund under the Administration Agreement. 
 From time to time, FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and Administrator) or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser or Administrator) or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and Administrator) may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our Unit Holders, subject to the cap on organization and offering expenses. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 
 The Fund entered into an Amended and Restated Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement for the first twelve months commencing upon the Fund s election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, which occurred on June 1, 2023, the Adviser, will be obligated to advance all of the Fund s Other Operating Expenses to the effect that such expenses do not exceed 0.50 (on an annualized basis) of the Fund s average net assets (referred to as a Required Expense Payment ). Any Required Expense Payment must be paid by the Adviser to the Fund in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds and/or offset against amounts due from the Fund to the Adviser or its affiliates. Other Operating Expenses means the Fund s professional fees (including accounting, legal, and auditing fees), custodian and transfer agent fees and third party valuation agent fees, insurance costs, director fees, administration fees, and other general and administrative expenses. For additional information, see Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Expenses and Transactions with Affiliates. 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired 401.8 million aggregate principal amount of investments (including 62.4 million of unfunded commitments).

The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. The Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 

periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company s industry; and 

review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 

50 

As part of the monitoring process, the Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, the Adviser rates the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of 1 to 5. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows: 
 1 The portfolio investment is performing above our underwriting expectations. 
 2 The portfolio investment is performing as expected at the time of underwriting. As a general rule, new investments are initially rated a 2. 
 3 The portfolio investment is operating below our underwriting expectations and requires closer monitoring. The company may be out of compliance with financial covenants, however, principal or interest payments are generally not past due. 
 4 The portfolio investment is performing materially below our underwriting expectations and returns on our investment are likely to be impaired. Principal or interest payments may be past due, however, full recovery of principal and interest payments are expected. 
 5 The portfolio investment is performing significantly below expectations and the risk of the investment has increased substantially. The company is in payment default and the principal and interest payments are not expected to be repaid in full. 
 The following table shows the composition of our debt portfolio on the 1 to 5 rating scale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income was 46.4 million and 134.9 million, respectively, driven by the combination of continued deployment and the performance of our investment portfolio. The size of our investment portfolio at fair value was 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024 and our weighted average yield on debt and income producing investments, at fair value, was 10.81 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, total investment income was 39.9 million and 104.5 million, respectively, primarily driven by our deployment of capital and the increased balance of our investments. The size of our investment portfolio at fair value was 1.3 billion at September 30, 2023 and our weighted average yield on debt and income producing investments, at fair value, was 11.61 . 
 The interest rate environment was stable for most of the quarter, as evidenced by SOFR remaining within a tight range around 5.30 through September 18, 2024. During this same timeframe spreads in the lower and core middle market, our primary area of focus, modestly compressed from levels seen roughly a year ago. While we consider higher interest rates when determining appropriate capital structures of our borrowers, additional interest rate increases and the resulting higher cost of capital have the potential to negatively impact the free cash flow of certain borrowers which could impact their ability to service their debt. Additionally, if higher interest rates occur concurrently during a slowdown in growth or period of economic weakness, our borrowers and potentially our portfolio performance may be negatively impacted. Alternatively, if interest rates decline, our investment income on the existing investment portfolio could be negatively impacted.

Interest Expense 
 Total interest expense (including unused fees and amortization of deferred financing costs) for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 16.8 million and 50.3 million, respectively. Total interest expense (including unused fees and amortization of deferred financing costs) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 15.9 million and 39.0 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by greater borrowings under our credit facility as we continue to grow the portfolio. The average principal balance outstanding increased from 589.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 747.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Management Fees 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, management fees were 2.2 million and 6.6 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, management fees were 2.0 million and 2.5 million, 
 52 

respectively. Management fees, which went into effect on June 9, 2023, are payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of the average daily net assets of the Fund throughout the month. Prior to June 9, 2023, the Fund did not incur a management fee. 
 Other Expenses 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total other expenses were 1.1 million and 3.0 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, total other expenses were 1.1 million and 1.6 million, respectively. Total other expenses over the periods were primarily driven by an increase in other general and administrative expenses driven by the larger portfolio and associated costs with managing the Fund. 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify annually for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. The election to be treated as a RIC will apply to the period from June 6, 2023 through December 31, 2023 and in subsequent years. For all periods prior to June 6, 2023, the Fund was treated as a partnership for tax purposes and was not subject to U.S. federal income tax. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our Unit Holders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our Unit Holders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual required distributable amount of income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 The Fund holds certain portfolio investments through wholly-owned subsidiaries taxed as corporations which may be subject to federal and state taxes. The wholly-owned subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Fund for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities as a result of its ownership of certain portfolio investments. Deferred tax liabilities are estimated and may differ materially depending on conditions when these investments earn income or are disposed. Income or gains recognized as a result of these investments will be reflected as a current tax liability and expense. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the Fund s consolidated financial statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Fund, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, recorded tax liabilities of 1,062,438 and 0 which are included in other accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund, through wholly-owned subsidiaries recognized a total benefit for taxes of 17,558 and provision for taxes of 1,062,438, respectively, which was comprised of provision for taxes related to income of 217,111 and 217,111, respectively, provision for taxes related to realized gain on investments of 237,455 and 237,455, respectively, and benefit for deferred tax expense of 472,124 and provision for deferred tax expense of 607,872, respectively. The Fund did not incur an excise tax for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Fund did not recognize any provisions for taxes. For all periods prior to June 6, 2023, the Fund was treated as a partnership for tax purposes and was not subject to U.S. federal income tax.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of our debt investments decreased primarily due to a markdown of one of our portfolio companies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the improved financial performance of our portfolio companies was offset predominantly by the markdown of one of our portfolio companies. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the fair value of our debt investments increased driven by spread tightening in the credit markets driven in part by rising rates and inflation. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of our continuous offering of Units, proceeds from net borrowings on our credit facilities, income earned and repayments on principal on our debt investments. The primary uses of our cash are for (i) originating and purchasing debt and other investments, (ii) funding the costs of our operations (including fees paid to our Adviser and expense reimbursements paid to our Administrator), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of our borrowings, (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our units and (v) funding repurchases under our unit repurchase program. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had one asset-based leverage facility. 
 In order to finance certain investment transactions, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into short-term borrowing arrangements. Such short-term borrowing arrangements include reverse repurchase agreements, whereby the Fund sells to Macquarie Bank Limited an investment that it holds and concurrently enters into an agreement to repurchase the same investment at an agreed-upon purchase price at a future date, generally not to exceed 180-days from the date it was sold. 
 The Fund may, from time to time, enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue additional debt securities, including debt securitizations, unsecured debt and other forms of debt. Any such incurrence or issuance may be from sources within the U.S. or from various foreign geographies or jurisdictions and may be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Additionally, any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an aggregate amount of 754.5 million and 743.0 million of debt outstanding and our asset coverage ratio was 192 and 191 , respectively. 
 Cash as of September 30, 2024, taken together with our 195.5 million of available capacity under our credit facilities (subject to borrowing base availability), proceeds from new or amended financing arrangements and proceeds from calling capital from uncalled commitments is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. This determination is based in part on our expectations for the timing of funding investment purchases and the use of existing and future financing arrangements. 
 Although we have attractive financing arrangements, any disruption in the financial markets or any other negative economic development could restrict our access to incremental financing in the future. We may not be able to find new financing for future investments or liquidity needs and, even if we are able to obtain such financing, such financing may not be on as favorable terms as we could have obtained previously. These factors may limit our ability to make new investments and adversely impact our results of operations. 
 54 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 32.2 million in cash and 24.4 million in short-term liquid investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 14.8 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments. Cash provided by financing activities was 0.8 million during the period, primarily as a result of distributions to investors, which was offset by capital called from investors. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 475.3 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments. Cash provided by financing activities was 437.5 million during the period, primarily as a result of calling capital from investors and net borrowings. 
 Equity 
 Prior to the BDC Conversion, the Fund operated as a private limited partnership. As a private limited partnership, the Fund entered into separate subscription agreements (each, a Subscription Agreement with investors who were admitted as Limited Partners. An affiliate of the Fund, FIAM Institutional Funds Manager, LLC, served as the general partner of the Fund and had a capital commitment of 10,000 which was fully funded prior to the BDC Conversion. In connection with the BDC Conversion, existing investors were admitted as members of the Fund. Capital Commitments of investors pursuant to subscription agreements entered into prior to the BDC Conversion continue to be outstanding capital commitments to the Fund. Existing capital accounts of Limited Partners were converted to corresponding Units of the Fund. Following the BDC Conversion, the Fund continues to enter into separate subscription agreements with a number of investors who will be admitted as Unit Holders providing for the private placement of the Fund s Units. Each subscriber makes a Capital Commitment to purchase Units of the Fund pursuant to the subscription agreement. Subscribers are required to make Capital Contributions to purchase Units of the Fund each time the Fund delivers a drawdown notice. Capital Commitments will generally be drawn from investors by the Fund as needed, upon 10 Business Days prior written notice, in such amounts as will be required by the Fund in its sole discretion. 
 Effective March 11, 2024, the Board approved the Fund entering into the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement which made eligible to invest any accredited investor (as enumerated in Rule 502 under Regulation D of the Securities Act) who have committed to a strategic relationship with Fidelity. In addition, the Board approved the Fund entering into a Placement Agent Agreement with Fidelity Distributors Company LLC, with respect to the private placement of its Units. 
 Additionally, the Fund intends to commence drawdowns of capital commitments of investors who make capital commitments after March 1, 2024 only after the Fund has drawn down the capital commitments of investors admitted prior to March 1, 2024 by 90 . 
 Investment companies managed by an affiliate, in aggregate, were owners of record of 100 of the total units as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Effective January 31, 2023, the Fund has the authority to issue an unlimited number of units. A Unit Holder shall have no liability in excess of its obligation to pay the purchase price for its units. 
 As of the dates indicated, we had aggregate Capital Commitments and unfunded Capital Commitments from investors as follows:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not expect to have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. 
 Our investment portfolio contains and is expected to continue to contain debt investments in the form of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the underlying loan agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had unfunded commitments to borrowers in the aggregate principal amount of 208.2 million and 246.5 million, respectively. 
 57 

From time to time, we may become party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. At September 30, 2024, we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation. 
 Related-Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 the Advisory Agreement; 

the Administration Agreement; 

the Transfer Agent Agreement; 

the Expense Support Agreement; 

Administrative Agent Expense Allocation Agreement; 

Affiliated investments; 

Affiliated Unit Holder Investments; 

Placement Agent Agreement; and 

Co-Investment Relief 

In addition to the aforementioned agreements, we, our Adviser, and certain of our Adviser s affiliates have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. See Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Expenses and Transactions with Affiliates. 
 Recent Developments 
 See Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 11. Subsequent Events for a summary of recent developments. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Fund values its investments, upon which its NAV is based, in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also provides a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the observability of inputs used to measure fair value and prescribes disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-5, the Board has designated the Adviser as the valuation designee responsible for valuing all of the Fund s investments, including making fair valuation determinations as needed. The Adviser has established a Fair Value Committee to carry out the day-to-day fair valuation responsibilities and has adopted policies and procedures to govern activities of the Fair Value Committee and the performance of functions required to determine the fair value of a fund s investments in good faith. These functions include periodically assessing and managing material risks associated with fair value determinations, selecting, applying, reviewing, and testing fair value methodologies, monitoring for circumstances that may necessitate the use of fair value, and overseeing and evaluating pricing services used. 
 58 

In accordance with the Adviser s policies and procedures, which have been approved by the Board, investments, including debt securities, that are publicly traded but for which no readily available market quotations exist are generally valued on the basis of information furnished by an independent third-party pricing service that uses a valuation matrix which incorporates both dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data processing techniques. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures, engages in oversight activities with respect to third-party pricing sources used and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. The Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe market quotations or prices received from third-party pricing services are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. 
 Investments that are not publicly traded or whose current market prices or quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined by the Adviser in good faith pursuant to the Adviser s Board-approved policies and procedures. Factors used in determining fair value vary by investment type and may include market or investment specific events, transaction data, estimated cash flows, and market observations of comparable investments. In determining fair value of the Fund s loan investments the types of factors that the Fair Value Committee may take into account generally include comparison to publicly-traded securities including such factors as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality, the enterprise value of the portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. 
 The Fund has engaged an independent valuation firm to prepare month-end valuation recommendations for investments for which market quotations are not readily available as of the last calendar day of each month. The independent valuation firm undertakes a full analysis of the investments and provides estimated fair values for such investments to the Adviser. The independent valuation firm also provides analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations. The Adviser s Fair Value Committee reviews and approves each valuation recommendation and confirms it has been calculated in accordance with the Board-approved policies and procedures. The Fair Value Committee manages the Fund s fair valuation practices and maintains the fair valuation policies and procedures. The Adviser reports to the Board information regarding the fair valuation process and related material matters. The Board may determine to modify its designation of the Adviser as valuation designee, relating to any or all Fund investments, at any time. 
 Our accounting policy regarding the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and requires the use of estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining fair value measurements, the fair values of our investments may differ from the amounts that we ultimately realize or collect from sales or maturities of our investments, and the differences could be material. 
 59 

Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, based on, among other things, input from independent third-party valuation firms engaged to review our investments. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we are required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on our investments to be different than the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) reflected in the valuations currently recorded. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates, including changes due to inflation. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure Unit Holders that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 100 of our debt investments at fair value were at floating rates. Based on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering base rate floors and ceilings for floating rate instruments assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure):
