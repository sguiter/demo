The following discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and related notes that appear in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on April 15, 2024. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements
that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking

the SEC on April 15, 2024, that can be read at www.sec.gov.

identify the most significant risks to our business, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized,
nor can there be any assurance that we have identified all possible issues which we might face. For all of these reasons, the reader is
cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. We assume
no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except as required

Overview 

The Company was organized
pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware on November 16, 1993. Beginning in 2020, the Company commenced its Kwik business operations
to allow sellers to make products or services available on the Kwik platform, at Kwik.com, offering a self-determined incentive budget
on goods or services in exchange for exposure and substantially increased sales volume. Kwik is a social interaction, selling, and referral
software platform. Stores and manufacturers Brands wishing to promote their products or services on the Kwik software
platform, which connects them to promoters, influencers, and customers. When the Brand is paid for the consumer purchases through the
Kwik platform, the Brand pays an incentive budget to Kwik. Kwik receives the entire incentive budget as revenue for generating the sales
through its platform, and recognizes cost of sales upon calculation and payment of the commissions paid to the wave of affiliates. 

Comparison of operations
for the Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized net revenues of 32,532 and 91,088, respectively, representing a 64 decrease. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized net revenues of 76,569 and 227,883 respectively, representing a decrease
of 66 . The year over year changes in revenue decreased as a result of fewer vendor and influencer promotions during 2024. Management
anticipates that revenues will increase as we continue to develop our KWIK services, add vendors, and add users. The Company is currently
in negotiations with several new brands, influencers, and influencer agencies, some of which anticipate joining the platform within the
next three to nine months, however, there are no firm commitments from these potential platform customers as of the date of this report. 

Cost of Sales 

Our costs of revenue, totaling
 20,218 and 88,546 respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 30,127 and 159,228, respectively, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, primarily consists of marketing incentives and services for products that are sold on brands
using the Kwik platform. The nature of the sales promotions in 2024 carried a lower cost of revenue compared to the same period in
2023. We expect the costs of revenue to fluctuate consistently with our sales volume and future product mix which is currently unpredictable
based on the early stages of the KWIK platform. 

Other Operating Expenses 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred total other operating expenses of 1,355,156 and 2,931,640, respectively.
The majority of the approximate 1,600,000 decrease resulted from an 800,000 decrease in management and payroll expenses, a 400,000
decline in our research and development activities, and 400,000 from other general and administrative expenses. During the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred total other operating expenses of 318,049 and 1,227,794 respectively. The approximate
decrease of 900,000 is comprised primarily of a 700,000 reduction in management and payroll, with the remaining majority of the reductions
coming in research and development. We do not expect to see substantial increases in our research and development activities until we
are able to generate the necessary funding from operations and / or the receipt of additional capital investment. 

12 

In the event we are able to
raise additional capital, we would anticipate our total operating expenses will trend upward as we add additional employees and consultants
to work on the execution of our business plan, which includes activities such as design and coding of our website and app, vendor acquisition,
cybersecurity, and user acquisition. We anticipate that much of this work will be done by outside consultants. In the coming 12 months,
we anticipate increasing our promotional and marketing activities which will increase our operating expenses in our efforts to increase
our product sales and user volumes. 

Liquidity and capital resources 

At
September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 3,195,178. Approximately 76 of our liabilities as of September 30, 2024 are
due to our majority shareholder, Mr. Fred Cooper. Mr. Cooper has provided 2,541,677 (exclusive of accrued interest of 237,241) in working
capital advances through September 30, 2024. These advances are due on demand. Mr. Cooper has informally agreed to defer repayment of
these loans until the Company has achieved a more stable liquidity position, however, he is not legally obligated to continue to do so. 

Capital advances have been
used to fund operating activities. We require additional capital to continue to operate our business, and to develop and expand our business.
Sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements with third parties may include equity or debt financing,
bank loans or revolving credit facilities. We may not be successful in locating suitable financing transactions in the time period required
or at all, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

There has been no change in our critical accounting
estimates from those disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Based on an evaluation under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were not effective as of
September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our
internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to (i) insufficient segregation of duties in the finance and accounting
functions due to limited personnel; and (ii) inadequate corporate governance policies. In the future, subject to working capital limitations,
we intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make improvements to remediate these deficiencies. 

13 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have not been any changes
in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal
period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

Inherent Limitations of
the Effectiveness of Internal Controls 

A control system, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system
are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. 

14 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

There has been no change in
our legal proceedings as disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 15,
2024. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

The Risk Factors identified
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed on April 15, 2024, continue to represent the most
significant risks to the Company s future results of operations and financial condition. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 

There were no unregistered
sales of equity securities not previously disclosed. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not Applicable.
