However, there can be no assurances that the current plans will generate any liquidity to the Company or be available on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to maintain sufficient financial resources, its business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. The Company may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its product discovery and development activities or future commercialization efforts. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Company s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

The number of shares authorized as of July 30, 2024 is consisting of shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock, designated as Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, and Series E preferred stock in the amounts included in the table below. Convertible Preferred Stock (Predecessor) Legacy Adagio classifies convertible preferred stock as temporary equity on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, as all such preferred stock is redeemable either at the option of the holder or upon an event outside the control of Legacy Adagio. The requirements of a deemed liquidation event, as defined within its amended and restated certificate of incorporation filed in November 2020, are not entirely within Legacy Adagio s control. In the event of such a deemed liquidation event, the proceeds from the event are distributed in accordance with the liquidation preferences, provided that the holders of preferred stock have not converted their shares into common stock. Legacy Adagio records the issuance of preferred stock at the issuance price less related issuance costs. Legacy Adagio has not adjusted the carrying value of outstanding preferred stock to its liquidation preference because a deemed liquidation event is not probable of occurring as of the end of the reporting period. During the periods from January 1, 2024 to July 30, 2024 (Predecessor), the following transactions have been executed: On June 25, 2024, shares of Series E Preferred Stock were extinguished and exchanged for shares of pre-funded warrants to purchase Series E Preferred Stock. See Note 10- Warrants for additional information regarding the Series E Pre-funded Warrants. The difference between the carrying value of the extinguished Series E Preferred Stock and the fair value of the issued Series E Pre-funded Warrants is recorded in additional paid-in capital. On the Closing Date, the Legacy Adagio s convertible preferred stocks were converted into shares of Legacy Adagio common stock on a -to-one basis prior to Adagio Merger Effective Time and then converted into shares of the Company s Common Stock and additional paid in capital at the Closing based on the exchange ratio set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. There were no preferred stock transactions during the year ended December 31, 2023 (Predecessor).

On the Closing Date, as explained in Note 3- Forward Merger , each share of Legacy Adagio issued and outstanding prior to the Closing Date was converted into the Company s Common Stock based on exchange ratio set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. Common Stock (Successor) As of September 30, 2024 (Successor), the Company s certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, authorized the Company to issue up to of common stock at a par value of per share, and shares of preferred stock, par value per share. As of September 30, 2024 (Successor), shares were issued and outstanding, including Sponsor Earnout (as defined below). In September 2024, the Company issued shares of the Company s Common Stock (such issuance, the Sponsor Earnout to the AYRA Sponsor under the Sponsor Letter Agreement dated February 13, 2024 the Sponsor Letter Agreement ). Pursuant to the agreement, the Sponsor Earnout shall be unvested and vests upon the earlier of: i) During the period from the effective time to the 10th anniversary of the Closing Date (the Earn-Out Period ), the stock price of the Company s Common Stock equals to or exceeds per share (the Trigger Price for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period from and after the Closing Date (the Earn-Out Target ), and ii) immediately prior to the consummation of a company sale during the Earn-Out Period. As of the reporting date, the vesting of the Sponsor Earnout was not considered probable. According to ASC 815, it is determined that the Sponsor Earnout is indexed to the Company s Common Stock and classified as equity and is initially measured at fair value and not subsequently remeasured. The Sponsor Earnout vests when the Company s stock price meets a stated price or there is a company sale during the earnout period. Upon meeting either vesting condition, the same number of the Company s Common Stock would be issued and no longer subject to forfeiture or cancellation. The Sponsor Earnout meets the ASC 815-40 indexation guidance. Specifically, the stated stock price and company sale, as the exercise contingencies, do not preclude equity indexation and there is no variability in the number of shares issuable under the Sponsor Earnout. Additionally, the Sponsor Earnout at the issuance meets the ASC 815-40 equity classification criterion as the Company has sufficient authorized shares available to settle the Sponsor Earnout and all the antidilution adjustments are in the control of the Company. The holders of the Company s Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends whenever funds are legally available, when and if declared by the Company s Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2024 (Successor), no cash dividend has been declared to date. Each share of the Company s Common Stock is entitled to one vote.

The 2012 Plan had a maximum 10-year term and as such, terminated in January 2022. 2022 Stock Incentive Plan In April 2022, the Legacy Adagio s Board approved, in conjunction with the termination of the 2012 Plan, the 2022 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2022 Plan ), permitting ISOs and NSOs to employees, directors and consultants. The maximum number of shares granted under the 2022 Plan cannot exceed plus any shares subject to stock options granted under the 2012 Plan that expired or were otherwise terminated without having been exercised in full, were forfeited, or were repurchased by the Company. The 2022 Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the 2012 Plan (thereafter both the 2012 and 2022 Plans are referred to as the Stock Incentive Plan ). The Stock Incentive Plan provides a means whereby participants may purchase shares of common stock pursuant to ISOs or NSOs and such persons may be granted shares of common stock for consideration consisting of cash and/or past services rendered to or on behalf of Legacy Adagio. ISOs may only be granted to employees. NSOs and stock purchase rights may be granted to employees and consultants. Generally, options awards only have service conditions that need to be met for the awards to vest, with the exception of grants to non-employees that had performance obligations that were deemed to be immaterial. The stock options generally vest over and have a contractual term. The fair value of each employee and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. As Legacy Adagio lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information required for valuation, Legacy Adagio estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. Due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected life term of ISOs that were granted after 2013 was determined using the simplified method provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Staff Accounting Bulletins Number 107 and 110. The expected life term of NSOs is determined either by using the simplified method, or by calculating the time to expiry from the grant date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is as Legacy Adagio has never paid nor does it expect to pay any cash dividend in the near future.

Overview We are a developmental stage medical device company focused on the development and commercialization of ablation technologies for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation AF ), atrial flutter AFL ), and ventricular tachycardia VT ). Our unique portfolio is based on Ultra-Low Temperature Cryoablation ULTC and Pulsed-Field Cryoablation PFCA ). Our technology is based on the hypothesis that the ability to consistently create durable, contiguous, transmural lesions is a foundation for improving the effectiveness and outcomes of cardiac ablations in both atria and ventricles. Our product portfolio consists of three product families: iCLAS atrial ULTC catheter and accessories, vCLAS ventricular ULTC catheter, and Cryopulse atrial PFCA catheter and accessories. All of these catheters share the same ULTC cryoablation console. A standalone Pulsed-Field Ablation (PFA) console connected to a cryoablation console for PFCA treatment synchronization is used in conjunction with Cryopulse catheter, subject to future integration for maximum operational flexibility and minimum footprint. We received CE Marking in Europe for our iCLAS Cryoablation System in May 2020 and have commercially launched in the EU. We are continually working towards reaching the next milestone in the development process for our portfolio of technologies. We received CE Marking in Europe for our VT Cryoablation System in March 2024 and have commercially launched in the EU. Key milestones include data readouts, clinical trials, and regulatory and commercialization developments in both the U.S. and European markets. The data readouts for each device are key valuation-driving milestones because investors use this data to understand the efficacy of the procedures. It is expected that favorable readouts will drive additional investment and financing for us at market terms.

Our net income (loss) was 3.6 million for the period from July 31, 2024 to September 30, 2024 (Successor), (21.3) million for the period from January 1, 2024 to July 30, 2024 (Predecessor), and (28.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively. The net cash used in operating activities was 6.4 million, 16.0 million, and 18.6 million, respectively. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 28.3 million and 1.4 million, respectively. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes we will continue as a going concern, which contemplate the realization of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business. We have limited revenue and has experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and anticipates that it will continue to do so for at least the next several years. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve-month period from the date the financial statements were made available. Additionally, management believes our current cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and therefore there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1-Organization and Description of Business in our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the going concern assessment. The need for additional capital will depend in part on the scope and costs of our development activities. To date, we have not generated any significant revenue from the sale of commercialized products. Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our products in the United States and Europe. Until such time, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity or debt, borrowings under credit facilities, or through potential collaborations, other strategic transactions or government and other grants. Adequate capital may not be available to us when needed or on acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise capital, we could be forced to delay, reduce, suspend or cease our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts, which would have a negative impact on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. See the section of the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 6, 2024 titled Risk Factors for additional information.

 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance We compete primarily on the basis that our products are designed to enable more physicians to treat more patients more efficiently and effectively. Our continued success depends on our ability to: continue to develop innovative, proprietary products that address significant clinical needs in a manner that is safe and effective for patients and easy-to-use for physicians obtain and maintain regulatory clearances or approvals demonstrate safety and effectiveness in our sponsored and third-party clinical trials expand its sales force across key markets to increase physician awareness obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for procedures using its products attract and retain skilled research, development, sales and clinical personnel cost-effectively manufacture, market and sell its products and obtain, maintain, enforce and defend our intellectual property rights and operate its business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others. Innovation Our business strategy relies significantly on innovation to develop and introduce new products and to differentiate our products from our competitors. We expect our research and development expenditures to increase as we make additional investments to support our growth strategies. We plan to increase our research and development expenditures with internal initiatives, as well as potentially licensing or acquiring technology from third parties. We also expect expenditures associated with our manufacturing organization to grow over time as production volume increases and we bring new products to market. Our internal and external investments will be focused on initiatives that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. With a significant investment in research and development, a strong focus on innovation and a well-managed innovation process, we believe we can continue to innovate and grow. Regulatory Our commercial success will depend upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the receipt of regulatory clearances, approvals, or authorizations for existing or new product offerings by us, or product enhancements. We must complete additional clinical testing before we can seek regulatory approval in the United States and begin commercialization of our products. After our products are cleared, approved, or authorized, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. As such, our ability to navigate, obtain and maintain the required regulatory clearances, approvals, or authorizations, as well as comply with other regulatory requirements, for our products will in part drive our results of operations and impact our business. Investments in Our Growth In order to generate future growth, we plan to continue to expand and leverage our sales and marketing infrastructure to increase our customer base and grow our business. Identifying and recruiting qualified sales and marketing personnel and training them on our products, applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and on our internal policies and procedures requires significant time, expense and attention. It often takes several months or more before a sales representative is fully trained and productive. Our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products will also depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing efforts as our plans to dedicate significant resources to our marketing programs.

 Competition Our industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Our most significant competitors are large, well-capitalized companies. We must continue to successfully compete considering our competitors existing and future products and related pricing and their resources to successfully market to the physicians who could use our products. Publications of clinical results by us, our competitors and other third parties can also have a significant influence on whether, and the degree to which, we are able to gain market share and increase utilization of our products. Reimbursement and Insurance Coverage In both U.S. and non-U.S. markets, our ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our products depends, in significant part, on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental payors (such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States), managed care organizations and private health insurers. Third-party payors decide which treatments they will cover and establish reimbursement rates for those treatments. Our products are purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from third-party payors for the procedures performed using our products. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In certain international markets, a product must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Furthermore, many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures. In most markets there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems.

 Key Components of Results of Operations Revenues We generate product revenue primarily from the sale of the catheters, stylets and warming balloons Consumables used with our consoles. We sell our products directly to hospitals and medical centers. To a lesser extent, we also generate lease revenue from the implied rental of consoles loaned to customers at no charge. We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Please refer to Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details on our revenue recognition policy. Our revenue is subject to fluctuation due to the foreign currency in which our products are sold. Costs and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes raw materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead, shipping and receiving costs and other less significant indirect costs related to the production of our products. Cost of revenue also includes the depreciation expense of consoles loaned to the customers. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses are expensed when incurred and are related to the development of our product candidates which includes pre-clinical, clinical, quality assurance, and research and development operational activities. These costs consist of: salaries, benefits, and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense for personnel engaged in research and development functions; activities associated with clinical trials performed by third parties; professional fees; equipment, materials, and costs related to product manufacturing; and other operational costs including rent and facilities costs, and depreciation. We do not track research and development expenses by project or product, as we are at an earlier stage in our pre-clinical and clinical development. Management believes that the breakdown of research and development expenses by project or product would be arbitrary and would not provide a meaningful assessment. Management expects the research and development expenses to increase, as we will incur incremental expenses associated with the product candidates that are currently under development and in pre-clinical and clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, and employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) for personnel in executive, finance and other administrative functions, allocated rent and facilities costs, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services, marketing costs and insurance costs, and transaction costs in connection with the Business Combination. We expense all selling, general and administrative costs as incurred.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, convertible promissory notes and the SVB Term Loan. Since inception we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows and anticipate continuing to do so for at least the next several years. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Successor had cash and cash equivalents of 28.3 million and Predecessor had 1.4 million, respectively. For the period from July 31, 2024 to September 30, 2024 (Successor) and from January 1, 2024 to July 30, 2024 (Predecessor), net income (losses) were 3.6 million and (21.3) million, respectively, and was (28.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). For the period from July 31, 2024 to September 30, 2024 (Successor), the period from January 1, 2024 to July 30, 2024 (Predecessor), and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor) net cash used in operating activities was 6.4 million, 16.0 million, and 18.6 million, respectively. For the twelve months after the issuance date of the financial statements, the Company projects 0.8 million of cash inflows from revenue. The Company does not require significant cash reserve to meet short term and long-term obligations with a balance of approximately 4.4 million for accounts payable, 2.9 million for accrued liabilities, and 0.4 million for other accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2024 (Successor). With the Company currently having a balance of 28.3 million in cash as of September 30, 2024 after the Closing of the Business Combination (refer to the Description of the Merger for additional details), the Company has more than adequate cash reserves to cover its current and non-current liabilities. Future Funding Requirements In the future, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities or otherwise. Until such time, if ever, that we can generate revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our operations through equity or debt financings, which may not be available to us on the timing needed or on terms that we deem to be favorable. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to maintain sufficient financial resources, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. We may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product discovery and development activities or future commercialization efforts. Our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: our revenue growth; our research and development efforts; our sales and marketing activities; our ability to raise additional funds to finance our operations; the outcome, costs and timing of any clinical trial results for our current or future products; the emergence and effect of competing or complementary products; the availability and amount of reimbursement for procedures using our products; our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights; our ability to retain our current employees and the need and ability to hire additional management and sales, scientific and medical personnel; the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we have or may establish; debt service requirements; and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies;

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are, therefore, not exposed to the financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10. We base our estimates on historical experience, current business factors and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider forming a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events, economic and political factors, and changes in our business environment; therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Accordingly, the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations; if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. These are the policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

 Stock-Based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards issued to employees and non-employees based on the estimated grant-date fair value, which is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of fair value for stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model requires management to make certain assumptions including expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends in addition to our common stock valuation. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. All stock-based compensation costs are recorded in cost of products sold, research and development expense or selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) based upon the respective employee s or non-employee s roles. Common Stock Valuations (Predecessor) Due to the absence of a public trading market, we determined the fair value of our common stock by considering numerous objective and subjective factors. The factors considered include, but are not limited to: (i) the results of contemporaneous independent third-party valuations of our common stock; (ii) the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; (iii) the lack of marketability of our common stock; (iv) actual operating and financial results; (v) current business conditions and projects; and (vi) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of our common stock was determined with probability weighted expected return method PWERM ), which assessed the probability weighted depending on different scenarios. As of June 30, 2024, the valuation was based on the scenario (i) bankruptcy/suboptimal sale scenario reflecting a zero return to common shareholders, with 0 probability, (ii) an as converted merger with a 95 probability, and (iii) a delayed but successful liquidity event per the option pricing method, with 5 probability. As of December 31, 2023, the valuation was based on the scenario (i) the bankruptcy/suboptimal sale scenario reflecting a zero return to common shareholders, with 20 probability (ii) a consummation of a business combination transaction with a SPAC, with 40 probability, and (iii) a delayed but successful liquidity event per the option pricing method, with 40 probability. As of December 31, 2023, in determining the value under the consummation of a business combination transaction with a SPAC scenario, we utilized the preliminary terms of the letter of intent with such SPAC that (i) the transaction based on diluted equity value of 38.8 million and (ii) all dilutive instruments are expected to convert or be exercised resulting in 6,369,633 total common shares outstanding. The valuation under the scenario of a delayed but successful liquidity event per the option pricing method was determined by the fair value per share at a marketable basis applied by a discount for lack marketability DLOM ). The fair value per share at a marketable basis was determined using the interval option value allocation approach. The DLOM was determined based on Finnerty put option model, marketability factors and restricted stock studies.

Table of Contents 
 The significant unobservable inputs into the valuation model include: the timing of potential events (for example, a consummation of a business combination transaction with a SPAC) and their probability of occurring; the selection of guideline public company multiples; and a discount for the lack of marketability of the common stock. An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation could result in a material change. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on the estimated fair value. Convertible Notes Valuation (Predecessor) As permitted under ASC 825, Financial Instruments ASC 825 ), the Company elected the fair value option to account for the October 2022 Convertible Notes, the April 2023 Convertible Notes, the November 2023 Convertible Notes, the 2024 Bridge Financing Note, the May 2024 Convertible Notes, the June 2024 Convertible Notes, and the July 2024 Convertible Notes in order to measure those liabilities at amounts that more accurately reflect the current economic environment in which Legacy Adagio operates. The change in fair value of the convertible promissory notes, excluding amounts related to interest, is recorded in Convertible notes fair value adjustment, while amounts related to interest are recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). As a result of applying the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the issuance of the convertible notes were expensed as incurred (i.e., not recognized as deferred costs). Refer to Note 3-Fair Value Measurements in our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional detail. As of December 31, 2023, Adagio calculated the value of the convertible notes based on the equity value from 409(a) valuations, considering the expected payoff of the convertible notes upon different types of events. Utilizing the PWERM, Adagio assessed the probability that the October 2022 Convertible Notes would be converted to common stock through the result of mandatory prepayment, Private Investment in PIPE Financing, or no PIPE Financing and no Qualified Financing, weighted with a probability of 20 , 40 and 40 , respectively, as of December 31, 2023. Utilizing the PWERM, Adagio assessed the probability that the April 2023 Notes and the November 2023 Notes would be converted to common stock as a result of a liquidation event, PIPE Financing, or no PIPE Financing no Qualified Financing, weighted with a probability of 20 , 40 and 40 as of December 31, 2023. Adagio also implied a credit spread by calibrating the value of the April 2023 Notes at issuance to the par value and then adjusted the calibrated credit spread for seniority difference and the market related movements as appropriate. Additional assumptions used to estimate the fair value include: (i) the expected timing of the conversion, (ii) the amount subject to equity conversion, the sum of the notes principal and unpaid accrued interest, (iii) expected volatility, (iv) risk-free interest rate, and (v) the discount rate, based on the observed option-adjusted spread (OAS) data of traded bonds rated CCC-. In determining the fair value of the convertible notes as of July 31, 2024 prior to the Closing, the Company used the observed closing stock price of ARYA as of July 31, 2024 multiplied by the actual number of shares that the convertible notes converted into. SVB Term Loan (Predecessor) Legacy Adagio accounts for the SVB Term Loan at residual value on the date of issuance. The expected life of the SVB Term Loan is the contractual term ending on the maturity date. Legacy Adagio classifies the term loan as current liabilities within twelve months of the maturity date or when otherwise due. Interest expense is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) over the contractual term of the loan. See Note 9-Debt in our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the SVB Term Loan.

 SVB Warrants (Predecessor) Adagio accounts for SVB Warrants outstanding as warrant liabilities at fair value, determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the common stock value from 409(a) valuation. The assumption used to estimate the fair value include: (i) expected volatility, (ii) risk-free interest rate, (iii) expected dividend yield, and (iv) expected term. The liability is subject to re-measurement at each reporting period and any change in fair value is recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). See Note 10-Warrants in our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the warrants. Series E Pre-funded Warrants (Predecessor) On June 25, 2024, Legacy Adagio issued to a certain investor the pre-funded warrants to purchase Legacy Adagio s Series E Preferred Stock Series E Pre-funded Warrant ), in exchange of the investor s existing holding of Series E Preferred Stock. The exercise price of the pre-funded warrants is 0.001 per warrant share. Legacy Adagio measured the Series E Pre-funded Warrants at fair value based on the indicated fair value of Series E Preferred Stock, which is not observable in the market. Convertible Preferred Stock (Predecessor) Prior to the Closing, Legacy Adagio recorded convertible preferred stock at fair value on the dates of issuance, net of issuance costs. Upon the occurrence of certain events that are outside our control, including a deemed liquidation event, holders of the convertible preferred stock can cause redemption for cash. As the preferred stock is considered to be contingently redeemable, the preferred stock has been classified outside of permanent equity. The preferred stock will be accreted to its redemption value if the deemed liquidation events are considered probable of occurring. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, the Legacy Adagio s convertible preferred stocks was converted into shares of Legacy Adagio s common stock on a one-to-one basis prior to Adagio Merger Effective Time and then converted into the Company s Common Stock at the Closing based on the exchange ratio set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. Convertible Securities Notes (Successor) The Company measures the Convertible Securities Notes at fair value based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which caused them to be classified as Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The change in fair value of the convertible promissory notes, excluding amounts related to interest, is recorded in Convertible notes fair value adjustment, while amounts related to interest are recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Company utilized the binomial lattice model to value the Convertible Securities Notes at the Closing Date and as of September 30, 2024. See Note 9- Debt in our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the SVB Term Loan. Convert Warrants (Successor) On July 31, 2024, the Company issued 1,500,000 Convert Warrants in connection with the issuance of the 20.0 million Convertible Securities Notes. As set forth in the agreement of the Convertible Securities Notes, the Convert Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis or on a gross basis for one share of the Company s Common Stock at 24.0 per share, subject to adjustments. The Company may be required to cash settle the Convert Warrants when it fails to timely deliver shares to the holder who exercises the Convert Warrants or upon the occurrence of a fundamental transaction. It is determined that the Convert Warrants do not meet the equity classification requirements under ASC 815 as the Covert Warrants may require cash settlement outside of the Company s control upon a failure of timely delivery of shares or a fundamental transaction, and therefore the Convert Warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities, and measured at fair value both initially and subsequently with changes in fair value recognized as warrant liabilities fair value adjustment within the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Convert Warrants are classified as Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The Company utilized the Black-Scholes Merton option model to value the Convertible Securities Notes at the Closing Date and as of September 30, 2024.

 PIPE Base Warrants (Successor) On the Closing Date, the Company issued Base Warrants PIPE Base Warrants along with the Company s Common Stock in connection with the PIPE Financing. The Base Warrants can be exercised to the Company s Common Stock at any time during the period from the issuance date to the expiration date which is the fifth anniversary from the date of issuance. The warrants can be exercised on a gross or net basis at an exercise price of 10 per share. The Base Warrants were fair valued at 2.41 per unit on the date of issuance based on the assumptions including (i) the value of the Company s Common Stock is 6.64 per share; (ii) a risk-free rate at 3.93 ; (iii) zero dividend yield; (iv) the common stock volatility at 84.0 and a volatility haircut of 10 ; (v) the remaining term is 5 years. According to the ASC 815, it is determined that the Base Warrants associated with the PIPE Financing are indexed to the Company s Common Stock under and are accounted for as equity, which is initially measured at fair value. The Base Warrants are classified as equity in the financial statements because they meet the ASC 815-40 indexation guidance. Specifically, 1) the Base Warrants can be exercised at any time during the exercise period without contingencies; 2) the Base Warrants can be settled in a fixed number of shares upon exercise with any adjustments, such as antidilution and alternative issuance adjustments, consistent with ASC 815 guidance, which does not preclude equity classification. Additionally, the Company has sufficient authorized shares available to settle the Base Warrants, and all the adjustments are in the control of the Company, further supporting the equity classification. Sponsor Earnout (Successor) In September 2024, the Company issued 1,147,500 shares of the Company s Common Stock (such issuance, the Sponsor Earnout to the AYRA Sponsor under the Sponsor Letter Agreement dated February 13, 2024 the Sponsor Letter Agreement ). Pursuant to the agreement, the Sponsor Earnout shall be unvested and vests upon the earlier of: i) During the period from the effective time to the 10th anniversary of the Closing Date (the Earn-Out Period ), the stock price of the Company s Common Stock equals to or exceeds 24.00 per share (the Trigger Price for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period from and after the Closing Date (the Earn-Out Target ), and ii) immediately prior to the consummation of a company sale during the Earn-Out Period. As of the reporting date, the vesting of the Sponsor Earnout was not considered probable. According to ASC 815, it is determined that the Sponsor Earnout is indexed to the Company s Common Stock and classified as equity and is initially measured at fair value and not subsequently remeasured. The Sponsor Earnout vests when the Company s stock price meets a stated price or there is a company sale during the earnout period. Upon meeting either vesting condition, the same number of the Company s Common Stock would be issued and no longer subject to forfeiture or cancellation. The Sponsor Earnout meets the ASC 815-40 indexation guidance. Specifically, the stated stock price and company sale, as the exercise contingencies, do not preclude equity indexation and there is no variability in the number of shares issuable under the Sponsor Earnout. Additionally, the Sponsor Earnout at the issuance meets the ASC 815-40 equity classification criterion as the Company has sufficient authorized shares available to settle the Sponsor Earnout and all the antidilution adjustments are in the control of the Company.

 PIPE Pre-funded Warrants (Successor) On July 31, 2024, the Company issued 670,000 pre-funded warrants in exchange for cash proceeds in PIPE Financing to certain Other PIPE Investors PIPE Pre-funded Warrants ). As set forth in the agreement of the PIPE Pre-funded Warrants, the PIPE Pre-funded Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis or on a gross basis for one share of the Company s Common Stock at 0.01 per share, subject to adjustments. The Company may be required to cash settle the PIPE Pre-funded Warrants when it fails to timely deliver shares to the holder who exercises the PIPE Pre-funded Warrants or upon the occurrence of a fundamental transaction. It is determined that the PIPE Pre-funded Warrants do not meet the equity classification requirements under ASC 815 as the PIPE Pre-funded Warrants may require cash settlement outside of the Company s control upon a failure of timely delivery of shares or a fundamental transaction, and therefore the PIPE Pre-funded Warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities, and measured at fair value both initially and subsequently with changes in fair value recognized as warrant liabilities fair value adjustment within the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The PIPE Pre-funded Warrants are classified as Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the PIPE Pre-funded Warrants is based on the fair value of the Company s Common Stock minus the exercise price. Strategic Realignment of Resources and Corporate Restructuring On December 1, 2023, Legacy Adagio approved a strategic realignment of resources and corporate restructuring (the RIF designed to reallocate capital, conformant to its business focus for the next two years. As part of the RIF, Legacy Adagio initiated a reduction in its workforce of 20 employees, representing approximately 19 of Legacy Adagio s employees, which was completed on December 15, 2023. Legacy Adagio made no payment for severance or related benefit costs. Legacy Adagio made no payment of retention bonuses. Emerging Growth Company Status We are an emerging growth company EGC ), as defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act permits companies with EGC status to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards, delaying the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period to enable us to comply with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting standards as of public company effective dates. In addition, we intend to rely on the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an EGC, we intend to rely on such exemptions, we are not required to, among other things: (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer s compensation to median employee compensation. We will remain an EGC under the JOBS Act until the earliest of (i) the last date of our fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, (ii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC with at least 700.0 million of outstanding securities held by non-affiliates, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the previous three-years.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We have operations primarily within the United States and we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our revenue generated in Europe, as well as costs and expenses denominated in Euro, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses, along with certain intercompany transactions, denominated in Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. We do not believe that foreign currency exchange risk has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures prior to the filing of this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, and determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at a reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the inadequate design and operation of management s review controls over valuation reports prepared by third-party specialists in conjunction with the accounting for certain debt and equity instruments, resulting in the conclusion that the Company s internal control over financial reporting and the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. We are currently implementing our remediation plan to address the material weaknesses identified above. Such measures include: 1) additional review of third-party valuation reports utilized in the accounting for certain debt and equity instruments; 2) additional review of the manual journal entries based on externally generated reports and agreements with regard to accounting issues in certain debt and equity instruments; 3) enhanced oversight controls on the work performed by third-party specialists.

 We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we detected all of our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than in connection with executing upon the continued implementation of the remediation measures referenced above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, litigation and other legal and administrative proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. We are currently not a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report include the risk factors described in our filings with the SEC, including the the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 6, 2024. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously described in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 6, 2024. We are a medical device company that has incurred net losses in every period to date and expect to continue to incur significant losses as we develop our business. We are a medical device company that has incurred net losses in each quarterly and annual period since inception and that has not yet generated any meaningful revenue. We expect to incur increasing costs as we continue to devote substantially all of our resources towards the development and anticipated further commercialization of our products, including iCLAS, vCLAS and Cryopulse. We cannot be certain if we will ever generate meaningful revenue or if or when we will produce sufficient revenue from operations to support our costs. Even if profitability is achieved, we may not be able to sustain profitability. Adagio Medical incurred net losses of 38.1 million and 23.7 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, Adagio Medical had an accumulated deficit of 135.2 million. We expect to incur substantial losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. In addition, as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. These increased expenses make it harder for us to achieve and sustain future profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including the other risks described in this report and in our other filings with the SEC. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses, if management identifies additional material weaknesses in the future or if we otherwise fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial position or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business and stock price or cause our access to the capital markets to be impaired. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company s management identified a material weakness related to the inadequate design and operation of management s review controls over valuation reports prepared by third-party specialists in conjunction with the accounting for certain debt and equity instruments, resulting in the conclusion that the Company s internal control over financial reporting and the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 and in a material misstatement to Adagio s financial statements. Accordingly, we determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses. 

 77 

Table of Contents 
 We are in the early stages of designing and implementing a plan to remediate the material weaknesses identified. Our plan for remediation includes: 1) additional review of third-party valuation reports utilized in the accounting for certain debt and equity instruments; 2) additional review of the manual journal entries based on externally generated reports and agreements with regard to accounting issues in certain debt and equity instruments; and 3) enhanced oversight controls on the work performed by third-party specialists. We cannot assure you that these measures will significantly improve or remediate the material weaknesses described above. The implementation of these remediation measures is in the early stages and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles and, as a result, the timing of when we will be able to fully remediate the material weaknesses is uncertain. If the steps we take do not remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner, there could be a reasonable possibility that these control deficiencies or others may result in another material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This, in turn, could jeopardize our ability to comply with our reporting obligations, limit our ability to access the capital markets and adversely impact our stock price. We and our independent registered public accounting firm were not required to perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we have identified all, or that we will not in the future have additional, material weaknesses. Material weaknesses may still exist when we report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by reporting requirements under Section 404. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing processes and take significant time to complete. These changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and harm our business. In addition, investors perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm our stock price and make it more difficult for us to effectively market and sell our products and services to new and existing customers. However, if we identify future deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or if we are unable to comply with the demands that are placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in a timely or effective manner, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within the timeframes required by the SEC. We also could become subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. In addition, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting when required, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, we may face restricted access to the capital markets and our stock price may be adversely affected. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may also become inadequate because of poor design or changes in our business, including increased complexity resulting from any international expansion, and weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods, undermine investor confidence in us and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities. None. Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities. None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable.
