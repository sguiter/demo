The
Company s U.S. treasury portfolio consists of securities issued by the United States Department of the Treasury U.S. treasury ).
The receipt of principal and interest on U.S. treasury securities is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
Based on these factors, along with the Company s intent to not sell the securities and its belief that it was more likely than
not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of its cost basis, the Company believed that the available-for-sale
U.S. treasury securities identified in the table above were temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The
Company s portfolio of municipal obligations consists of both tax-exempt and taxable general obligations securities issued by various
municipalities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not intend to sell and it was more likely than not that the Company would not
be required to sell its municipal obligations in an unrealized loss position until the recovery of its cost basis. Due to the issuers 
continued satisfaction of the securities obligations in accordance with their contractual terms and the expectation that they
will continue to do so, the evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers financial condition and other objective evidence, the
Company believed that the municipal obligations identified in the tables above were temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023. 

The
Company s agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio consists of securities underwritten to the standards of and guaranteed by
the government-sponsored agencies of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC ), Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA and the Government National Mortgage Association. The receipt of principal, at par, and interest on agency mortgage-backed
securities is guaranteed by the respective government-sponsored agency guarantor, such that the Company believed that its agency mortgage-backed
securities did not expose the Company to credit-related losses. Based on these factors, along with the Company s intent to not
sell the securities and the Company s belief that it was more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the
securities before recovery of their cost basis, the Company believed that the agency mortgage-backed securities identified in the table
above were temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The
Company s other investment securities portfolio consists of seven subordinated debentures issued by financial institutions. These
investment securities were acquired in the Freedom Bank acquisition in 2022 and classified as held-to-maturity. The securities were issued
in 2021 and 2022 with a 10 year maturity and a fixed rate for five years. The securities are callable after the end of the fixed rate
term, beginning September 3, 2026. The following table provides information regarding the Company s allowance for credit losses

table below sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities at September 30, 2024. The table includes scheduled
principal payments and estimated prepayments, based on observable market inputs, for agency mortgage-backed securities. Actual maturities

The
Company s key credit quality indicator is a loan s performance status, defined as accruing or non-accruing. Performing loans
are considered to have a lower risk of loss. Non-accrual loans are those which the Company believes have a higher risk of loss. The accrual
of interest on non-performing loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent, unless the credit is well secured and
in process of collection. Loans are placed on non-accrual or are charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest
is considered doubtful. There were no loans 90 days or more delinquent and accruing interest at either September 30, 2024 or December
31, 2023.

Under
the original terms of the Company s non-accrual loans, interest earned on such loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023 would have increased interest income by and , respectively. No interest income related to non-accrual loans
was included in interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The
Company also categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt,
such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends,
among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on
a quarterly basis. Nonclassified loans generally include those loans that are expected to be repaid in accordance with contractual loan
terms. Classified loans are those that are assigned a special mention, substandard or doubtful risk rating using the following definitions: 

Special
Mention: Loans are currently protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged but such
protection is potentially weak. These loans constitute an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a classification
of substandard. The credit risk may be relatively minor, yet constitutes an unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances surrounding
a specific asset. 

Substandard:
Loans are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged. Loans have
a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Loans are characterized by the distinct possibility
that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful:
Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that weaknesses
make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.

through the FHLB at September 30, 2024 compared to million letters of credit December 31, 2023 to secure municipal deposits. The
Company did not have any term advances from FHLB at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Although
no loans are specifically pledged, the FHLB requires the Bank to maintain eligible collateral (qualifying loans and investment securities)
that has a lending value at least equal to its required collateral. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were blanket pledges
of loans and securities to the FHLB totaling million and million, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, the Bank s total borrowing capacity with the FHLB was approximately million and million, respectively. At September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank s available borrowing capacity was million and million, respectively. The
difference between the Bank s total borrowing capacity and available borrowing capacity is related to the amount of borrowings
outstanding and letters of credit. The available borrowing capacity with the FHLB is collateral based, and the Bank s ability to
borrow is subject to maintaining collateral that meets the eligibility requirements. The borrowing capacity is not committed and is subject
to FHLB credit requirements and policies. In addition, the Bank must maintain a restricted investment in FHLB stock to maintain access
to borrowings.

A
description of the Company s revenue streams under ASC 606 follows: 

Service
Charges on Deposit Accounts 

The
Company earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees,
which include services such as ATM usage fees, stop payment charges, statement rendering, and ACH fees, are recognized at the time the
transaction is executed as that is the point in time the Company fulfills the customer s request. Account maintenance fees, which
relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period during which the Company satisfies
the performance obligation. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs. Service charges on deposits
are withdrawn from the customer s account balance. 

Interchange
Income 

The
Company earns interchange fees from debit cardholder transactions conducted through the interchange payment network. Interchange fees
from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the
transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. 

Gains
(Losses) on Sales of Real Estate Owned 

The
Company records a gain or loss from the sale of real estate owned when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally
occurs at the time of an executed deed. When the Company finances the sale of real estate owned to the buyer, the Company assesses whether
the buyer is committed to perform their obligations under the contract and whether collectability of the transaction price is probable.
Once these criteria are met, the real estate owned asset is derecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded upon the transfer of
control of the property to the buyer. In determining the gain or loss on the sale, the Company adjusts the transaction price and related
gain (loss) on sale if a significant financing component is present. There were no sales of real estate owned that were financed by the
Company during the first nine months of 2024 or 2023.

The
Company s investment securities classified as available-for-sale include U.S. treasury securities, municipal obligations, and agency
mortgage-backed securities. Quoted exchange prices are available for the Company s U.S. treasury securities, which are classified
as Level 1. U.S. federal agency mortgage-backed securities are priced utilizing industry-standard models that consider various assumptions,
including time value, yield curves, volatility factors, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual
prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions
are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are
executed in the marketplace. These measurements are classified as Level 2. Municipal obligations are valued using a type of matrix, or
grid, pricing in which securities are benchmarked against U.S. treasury rates based on credit rating. These model and matrix measurements
are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Changes
in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are included in other comprehensive income to the extent the changes are not considered
to be credit related which would instead result in a credit loss reserve. The Company evaluates any potential credit losses on available-for-sale
securities on a quarterly basis and credit losses identified on individual securities result in a write-down of the relevant security s
cost basis. 

Mortgage
loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at fair value. The mortgage loan valuations are based on quoted
secondary market prices for similar loans and are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair value of mortgage loans originated and intended
for sale in the secondary market and derivative financial instruments are included in gains on sales of loans. 

Contractual balance 

Gain 

The
Company s derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate lock commitments and corresponding forward sales contracts
on mortgage loans held for sale. The fair values of these derivatives are based on quoted prices for similar loans in the secondary market.
The market prices are adjusted by a factor, based on the Company s historical data and its judgment about future economic trends,
which considers the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan. These instruments are classified as Level 2.
The amounts are included in other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and gains on sales of loans, net in
the consolidated statements of earnings. The total amount of gains from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments included
in earnings for the periods indicated were as follows: 

Valuation
Methods for Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

The
Company does not record its loan portfolio at fair value. Collateral-dependent loans are generally carried at the lower of cost or fair
value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs. Collateral values are determined based on appraisals performed by qualified licensed
appraisers hired by the Company and then further adjusted if warranted based on relevant facts and circumstances. The appraisals may
utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including the comparable sales and income approach. Adjustments are
routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Individually
evaluated loans are reviewed at least quarterly for additional allowance and adjusted accordingly, based on the same factors identified
above. The carrying value of the Company s individually evaluated loans was million at September 30, 2024 and million
at December 31, 2023. The Company s individually evaluated loans with an allowance for credit losses was million and 
million, with an allocated allowance of and , at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Real
estate held-for-sale includes premises and equipment that were previously used as a bank branch facility and is included in other assets
on the balance sheet. Real estate held-for-sale is initially recorded at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs.
Subsequent valuations are updated periodically and are based upon independent appraisals, third party price opinions or internal pricing
models. The appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including the comparable sales and income
approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable
sales and income data available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for
determining fair value. Real estate held-for-sale is reviewed and evaluated at least annually for additional allowance and adjusted accordingly,
based on the same factors identified above. 

Real
estate owned includes assets acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure and land previously acquired for expansion. Real estate owned
is initially recorded at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. Subsequent valuations are updated periodically
and are based upon independent appraisals, third party price opinions or internal pricing models. The appraisals may utilize a single
valuation approach or a combination of approaches including the comparable sales and income approach. Adjustments are routinely made
in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments
are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Real estate owned is reviewed
and evaluated at least annually for additional allowance and adjusted accordingly, based on the same factors identified above.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview .
 Landmark Bancorp, Inc. is a financial holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is engaged in the
banking business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Landmark National Bank, and in the insurance business through its wholly owned
subsidiary, Landmark Risk Management, Inc. References to the Company, we, us, and our 
refer collectively to Landmark Bancorp, Inc., Landmark National Bank and Landmark Risk Management, Inc. The Company is listed on the
Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol LARK. The Bank is dedicated to providing quality financial and banking services to
its local communities. Our strategy includes continuing a tradition of holding and acquiring quality assets while growing our commercial,
commercial real estate CRE and agriculture loan portfolios. We are committed to developing relationships with our borrowers
and providing a total banking service. 

The
Bank is principally engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such deposits, together with borrowings
and other funds, to originate one-to-four family residential real estate, construction and land, CRE, commercial, agriculture, municipal
and consumer loans. Although not our primary business function, we invest in certain investment and mortgage-related securities using
deposits and other borrowings as funding sources. 

Landmark
Risk Management, Inc., which was formed and began operations in 2017, is a Nevada-based captive insurance company which provides property
and casualty insurance coverage to the Company and the Bank for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible
in the current insurance marketplace. Landmark Risk Management, Inc. is subject to the regulations of the State of Nevada and undergoes
periodic examinations by the Nevada Division of Insurance. 

Our
results of operations depend generally on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest-earning
assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by regulatory, economic and competitive
factors that influence interest rates, loan demand and deposit flows. In addition, we are subject to interest rate risk to the degree
that our interest-earning assets mature or reprice at different times, or at different speeds, than our interest-bearing liabilities.
Our results of operations are also affected by non-interest income, such as service charges, loan fees, gains from the sale of newly
originated loans, gains or losses on investments and certain other non-interest related items. Our principal operating expenses, aside
from interest expense, consist of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy costs, professional fees, data processing expenses and
provision for credit losses. 

We
are significantly impacted by prevailing economic conditions, including federal monetary and fiscal policies, and federal regulations
of financial institutions. Deposit balances are influenced by numerous factors such as competing investments, the level of income and
the personal rate of savings within our market areas. Factors influencing lending activities include the demand for housing and the interest
rate pricing competition from other lending institutions. 

Currently,
our business consists of ownership of the Bank, with its main office in Manhattan, Kansas and twenty nine additional branch offices in central,
eastern, southeast and southwest Kansas, one loan production office in Kansas City, Missouri and our ownership of Landmark Risk Management,
Inc. On October 1, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Freedom Bancshares, Inc., the holding company of Freedom Bank. Freedom
Bank was founded in 2006 and operated out of a single location in Overland Park, Kansas. 

In
October 2024, we declared our 93 rd consecutive quarterly dividend, and we currently have no plans to change our dividend strategy
given our current capital and liquidity position. However, while we have achieved a strong capital base and expect to continue operating
profitably, our future dividend practice is dependent upon the performance of the economy and the Company s overall performance.
In addition, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we will not be permitted to make capital
distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) or pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction
if we do not maintain 2.5 in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to a capital conservation buffer, a standard we exceeded at September
30, 2024. In October 2024, we also declared a 5 stock dividend. The stock dividend will be issued on December 16, 2024. This is the
24 th consecutive year that the Company has issued a 5 stock dividend. 

Critical
Accounting Policies . Critical accounting policies are those which are both most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies relate to the
allowance for credit losses and the accounting for business combinations, each of which involve significant judgment by our management.
There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies included under Item 7 Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 27, 2024.

Summary
of Results . During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded net earnings of 3.9 million, which was an increase of 1.1 million,
or 36.6 , from net earnings of 2.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, we recorded net earnings
of 9.7 million, which was an increase of 124,000, or 1.3 , from net earnings of 9.6 million during the first nine months of 2023.
The increase in net earnings during 2024 was primarily related to an increase in net interest income and non-interest income.

Interest
Income. Interest income of 19.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 represented an increase of 2.2 million, or
13.3 , compared to the same period of 2023. Interest income on loans increased 2.4 million, or 17.8 , to 15.9 million for the quarter
ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023 due to higher yields and average balances. Our yields increased from 5.93 
in the third quarter of 2023 to 6.43 in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in interest income on loans was also driven by an increase
in average loan balances which increased from 906.3 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 985.7 million in the third quarter of 2024.
Interest income on investment securities decreased 169,000, or 5.3 , to 3.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 3.2
million in the same period of 2023. The decrease in interest income on investment securities was primarily the result of a decrease in
the average balances of investment securities which decreased from 486.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 428.3 million in the
third quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting the lower average balances was in increase in yields, which increased from 2.77 in the third
quarter of 2024 to 2.99 in the third quarter of 2024. 

Interest
income of 54.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represented an increase of 7.8 million, or 16.4 , compared to
the same period of 2023. Interest income on loans increased 7.9 million, or 21.1 , to 45.4 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, due to an increase in our average loan balances, which increased from 877.0 million during
the first nine months of 2023 to 962.3 million during the first nine months of 2024. Also contributing to higher interest income were
higher yields on loans, which increased from 5.72 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.31 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. Interest income on investment securities decreased 116,000, or 1.2 , to 9.4 million for the first nine months of
2024, as compared to 9.5 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease in interest income on investment securities was the result
of a decrease on average balances of investment securities which decreased from 493.9 million in the first nine months of 2023 to 440.7
million in the same period of 2024. Partially offsetting the lower average balances was an increase in yields, which increased from 2.72 
in the first nine months of 2023 to 2.99 in the same period of 2024. 

Interest
Expense . Interest expense during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.3 million to 7.4 million, as compared to
the same period of 2023. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased 1.4 million to 5.8 million for the quarter ended September
30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023. Our total cost of interest-bearing deposits increased from 1.93 in the third quarter
of 2023 to 2.48 in the third quarter of 2024 as a result of higher rates and increased competition for deposits. Also contributing to
higher interest expense was an increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances, which increased from 902.7 million in the third
quarter of 2023 to 936.2 million in the third quarter of 2024. For the third quarter of 2024, interest expense on borrowings decreased
 196,000 to 1.6 million, as compared to the same period of 2023 due to a decrease in our average borrowings and repurchase agreements
which decreased 16.1 million from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting the decrease in average
borrowing was an increase in rates, which increased from 5.60 in the third quarter of 2023 to 5.72 in the same period of 2024. 

Interest
expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.8 million to 21.6 million, as compared to the same period of 2023.
Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased 6.6 million to 17.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as
compared to the same period of 2023. The increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was the result of higher rates as
our cost of interest-bearing deposits increased from 1.57 in the first nine months of 2023 to 2.42 in the same period of 2024. The
increase in interest expense on deposits was also due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances, which increased from
 886.2 million in the first nine months of 2023 to 936.0 million in the same period of 2024. For the first nine months of 2024, interest
expense on borrowings increased 246,000, to 4.7 million as compared to the same period of 2023, due primarily to an increase in rates,
which increased from 5.26 in the first nine months of 2023 to 5.75 in the same period of 2024. Partially offsetting the increase in
interest expense on borrowings was a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings which decreased from 112.3 million in the first
nine months of 2023 to 108.4 million in the first nine months of 2024. 

Net
Interest Income . Net interest income increased 978,000, or 9.2 , to 11.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to
the same period of 2023. The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of an increase in interest income on loans, partially
offset by higher interest expense and a decrease in interest income on investment securities. The accretion of purchase accounting adjustments
increased net interest income by 282,000 in the third quarter of 2023 compared to an increase of 336,000 in the third quarter of 2024,
and was primarily related to fair value adjustments on loans acquired in the Freedom Bank transaction. Compared to the same period last
year, the increase in interest rates raised the yields on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities.
Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.06 in the third quarter of 2023, compared to 3.30 in the third quarter of 2024.
Lower interest rates may not result in a higher net interest margin as a result of increased competition for loans and deposits. 

Net
interest income increased 919,000, or 2.8 , to 33.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023.
The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of an increase in interest income on loans, partially offset by higher interest
expense and a decrease in interest income on investment securities. The accretion of purchase accounting adjustments increased net interest
income by 750,000 in the first nine months of 2023 compared to an increase of 850,000, in the first nine months of 2024 and was primarily
related to fair value adjustments on loans acquired in the Freedom Bank transaction. Net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis,
increased from 3.19 in the first nine months of 2023 to 3.21 in the same period of 2024.

Rate/Volume
Table . The following table describes the extent to which changes in tax-equivalent interest income and interest expense
for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities affected the Company s interest income and expense
for the periods indicated. The table distinguishes between (i) changes attributable to rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume),
(ii) changes attributable to volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate), and (iii) net change (the sum of (i) and (ii)). The
net changes attributable to the combined effect of volume and rate that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately to the
change due to volume and the change due to rate.

Provision
for Credit Losses . During the third quarter of 2024, a 500,000 provision for credit losses was recorded, compared to no provision
for credit losses recorded in the same period of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our analysis of our allowance for credit losses indicated
a provision was required based on loan growth, current and projected economic conditions and other qualitative factors. We recorded net
loan charge-offs of 9,000 during the third quarter of 2024, compared to net loan recoveries of 521,000 during the third quarter of
2023. 

During
the first nine months of 2024, we recorded a 800,000 provision for credit losses, compared to a 299,000 provision for credit losses
in the first nine months of 2023. The provision for credit losses during the first nine months of 2024 consisted of a 900,000 provision
to the allowance for credit losses on loans and a 100,000 credit provision to the allowance for unfunded loan commitments. The 299,000
provision for credit losses during the first nine months of 2023 consisted of a 250,000 provision to the allowance for credit losses
on loans, a 30,000 provision to the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and a 19,000 provision to the allowance for credit losses
on held-to-maturity investment securities. We recorded net loan recoveries of 36,000 during the first nine months of 2024, compared
to net loan recoveries of 406,000 during the first nine months of 2023. 

For
further discussion of the allowance for credit losses, refer to the Asset Quality and Distribution section below. 

Non-interest
Income . Total non-interest income was 4.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 601,000, or 16.5 , from the
same period in 2023. The increase in non-interest income during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year
was primarily due to an increase in fees and service charges of 262,000 primarily due to higher fees related to deposit accounts. Gains
on sales of one-to-four family residential real estate loans increased 213,000 due to lower interest rates. Other non-interest income
also increased by 102,000, which was primarily due to a 273,000 gain on sale during the quarter of a former branch facility located
in Overland Park, Kansas. 

Total
non-interest income was 11.4 million in the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 397,000, or 3.6 , from the first nine months
of 2023, primarily as a result of an increase of 575,000 in fees and service charges due primarily to higher fees related to deposits
accounts. Also contributing to the increase in non-interest income was an increase in bank owned life insurance of 76,000. Offsetting
this increase was a decrease of 150,000 in gains on sales of loans. Other non-interest income also decreased by 104,000 primarily due
to a decrease in lease income associated with the rental income from a former branch facility, which was sold in the third quarter of
2024. 

Non-interest
Expense . Non-interest expense totaled 10.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 170,000, or 1.6 , over the
same quarter of 2023. The decrease in non-interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year
was mainly due to a decrease in amortization of mortgage servicing rights, other intangibles, and professional fees. Partially offsetting
the decrease in non-interest expense was an increase in occupancy and equipment and other non-interest expense. 

30 

Non-interest
expense totaled 32.2 million for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 784,000, or 2.5 , from 31.4 million for the first nine
months of 2023. The increase in non-interest expense in the first nine months 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was
mainly due to an increase in other non-interest expense associated with a 1.1 million valuation allowance recorded against real estate
held for sale. Also contributing to the increase in non-interest expense was an increase in professional fees associated with increased
legal costs associated with revisions to our benefit plans. Partially offsetting the increase in non-interest expense was a decrease
amortization of mortgage serving rights and other intangibles, data processing, occupancy and equipment and compensation and benefits. 

Income
Tax Expense . During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 867,000, compared to income tax expense of
 671,000 during the same period of 2023. Our effective tax rate decreased from 18.9 in the third quarter of 2023 to 18.1 in the third
quarter of 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to increases in tax credits and tax exempt income. 

We
recorded income tax expense of 2.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to income tax expense of 2.1 million in the
same period of 2023. Our effective tax rate was 17.7 in the first nine months of 2023, compared to 16.9 in the first nine months of
2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increases in tax credits and tax-exempt income. 

Financial
Condition. Economic conditions in the United States remained sluggish during the first nine months of 2024 as elevated inflation
levels and high interest rates continued to impact the economy. The sustained high interest rates have impacted financial institutions
generally, resulting in continued higher costs of funding and lower fair values for investment securities. We maintain strong capital
and liquidity, and a stable, conservative deposit portfolio with a significant majority of our deposits being retail-based and insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured. We spend significant time each month monitoring our interest
rate and concentration risks through our asset/liability management and lending strategies that involve a relationship-based banking
model offering stability and consistency. The State of Kansas and the geographic markets in which the Company operates have also been
impacted by economic headwinds. Supply chain constraints, labor shortages and geopolitical events have contributed to the rising inflation
levels which are impacting all areas of the economy both nationally and locally. The Company s allowance for credit losses continues
to factor in estimates of the economic impact of these conditions and other qualitative factors on our loan portfolio. However, our loan
portfolio is diversified across various types of loans and collateral throughout the markets in which we operate. Aside from a few problem
loans that management is working to resolve, our asset quality has remained strong over the past few years. While further increases in
problem assets may arise, management believes its efforts to run a high quality financial institution with a sound asset base will continue
to create a strong foundation for continued growth and profitability in the future. 

Asset
Quality and Distribution . Our primary investing activities are the origination of one-to-four family residential real estate,
construction and land, CRE, commercial, agriculture, municipal and consumer loans and the purchase of investment securities. Total assets
were 1.6 billion at both December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. 

The
allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses based on our economic projections. At September 30,
2024, our allowance for credit losses on loans totaled 11.5 million, or 1.15 of gross loans outstanding, compared to 10.6 million,
or 1.12 of gross loans outstanding, at December 31, 2023. The increase in our allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of
gross loans outstanding was primarily due to current and projected economic conditions and other qualitative factors. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 26.9 million and 7.5 million, respectively, of loans were considered classified
and assigned a risk rating of special mention, substandard or doubtful. These ratings indicate that these loans were identified as potential
problem loans having more than normal risk and raised doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment
terms. Even though borrowers were experiencing moderate cash flow problems as well as some deterioration in collateral value, management
believed the allowance for credit losses was sufficient to cover expected losses related to such loans at September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively. 

Loans
past due 30-89 days and still accruing interest totaled 7.3 million, or 0.73 of gross loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.6
million, or 0.17 of gross loans, at December 31, 2023. The increase in past due loans was primarily related to a single commercial loan
and an agriculture loan. At September 30, 2024, 13.4 million in loans were on non-accrual status, or 1.34 of gross loans, compared
to 2.4 million, or 0.25 of gross loans, at December 31, 2023. The increase in non-accrual status loans was primarily related to one
commercial loan which was put on non-accrual status in the third quarter of 2024. Non-accrual loans consist of loans 90 or more days
past due and certain individually evaluated loans. There were no loans 90 days delinquent and accruing interest at either September 30,
2024 or December 31, 2023. 

31 

As
part of our credit risk management, we continue to manage the loan portfolio to identify problem loans and have placed additional emphasis
on CRE and construction and land relationships. We are working to resolve the remaining problem credits or move the non-performing credits
out of the loan portfolio. At September 30, 2024 we had 428,000 of real estate owned compared to 928,000 of real estate owned at December
31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, real estate owned primarily consisted undeveloped land and residential real estate properties. The
Company is currently marketing all of the remaining properties in real estate owned. 

Liability
Distribution . Our primary ongoing sources of funds are deposits, FHLB borrowings, proceeds from principal and interest payments
on loans and investment securities and proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans and investment securities. While maturities and scheduled
amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest
rates and economic conditions. We experienced a decrease of 40.7 million, or 3.1 in total deposits during the first nine months of
2024, to 1.3 billion at September 30, 2024. The decrease in deposits was primarily due to a seasonal decrease in our deposit accounts
due to public funds. 

Non-interest-bearing
deposits at September 30, 2024 were 360.2 million, or 28.2 of deposits, compared to 367.1 million, or 27.9 of deposits, at December
31, 2023. Money market and checking deposit accounts were 44.4 of our deposit portfolio and totaled 565.6 million at September 30,
2024, compared to 613.6 million, or 46.6 of deposits, at December 31, 2023. Savings accounts decreased to 145.8 million, or 11.4 
of deposits, at September 30, 2024, from 152.4 million, or 11.6 of deposits, at December 31, 2023. Certificates of deposit totaled
 203.9 million, or 16.0 of deposits, at September 30, 2024, compared to 183.2 million, or 13.9 of deposits, at December 31, 2023.
The increase in certificates of deposit was primarily related to higher brokered certificates of deposits, which increased from 42.8
million at December 31, 2023 to 49.8 million at September 30, 2024. 

Overdraft
deposits consist of non-interest-bearing deposits, money market and checking deposit accounts with negative balances. These overdraft
balances totaled 383,000 at September 30, 2024 and 318,000 as of December 31, 2023 and were presented as loans on the balance sheet. 

Total
deposits include estimated uninsured deposits of 388.0 million and 430.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
This represented approximately 30.4 of our total deposits at September 30, 2024 and compares favorably with other similar community
banking organizations. Over 95 of the Company s total deposits were considered core deposits at September 30, 2024. These deposit
balances are from retail, commercial and public fund customers located in the markets where the Company has bank branch locations. 

Certificates
of deposit at September 30, 2024, scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled 130.6 million. Historically, maturing deposits have
generally remained with the Bank, and we believe that a significant portion of the deposits maturing in one year or less will remain
with us upon maturity in some type of deposit account. 

Total
borrowings increased 24.2 million to 123.2 million at September 30, 2024, from 99.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in
total borrowings was primarily due to an increase in FHLB borrowings. The increase in FHLB borrowings was to fund loan growth and to
offset the decline in deposits. 

Cash
Flows. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 5.9 million. Our operating
activities provided net cash of 15.3 million during the first nine months of 2024 primarily as a result of net earnings. Our investing
activities used net cash of 869,000 during the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to loan growth. Financing activities used net
cash of 20.3 million during the first nine months of 2024, primarily as a result of a decrease in deposits. 

Liquidity .
 Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available-for-sale. The levels of these assets are
dependent on the operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given year. These liquid assets totaled 436.6 million
at September 30, 2024 and 484.8 million at December 31, 2023. During periods in which we are not able to originate a sufficient amount
of loans and/or periods of high principal prepayments, we generally increase our liquid assets by investing in short-term, high-grade
investments or holding higher balances of cash and cash equivalents. 

32 

Liquidity
management is both a daily and long-term function of our strategy. Excess funds are generally invested in short-term investments. Excess
funds are typically generated as a result of increased deposit balances, while uses of excess funds are generally deposit withdrawals
and loan advances. In the event we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, additional funds are generally available
through the use of FHLB advances, a line of credit with the FHLB, other borrowings or through pledging or sales of investment securities.
While the sale of available-for-sale investment securities would result in losses due to the current interest environment, pledging these
securities as collateral would not result in a loss. At September 30, 2024, we had 86.4 million borrowed on our line of credit with
the FHLB. At September 30, 2024, we had collateral pledged to the FHLB that would allow us to borrow 272.2 million, subject to FHLB
credit requirements and policies. At September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings through the Federal Reserve discount window, while our
borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve was 54.0 million. We also have various other federal funds agreements, both secured and
unsecured, with correspondent banks totaling approximately 30.0 million in available credit under which we had no outstanding borrowings
at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had subordinated debentures totaling 21.7 million and 9.5 million of repurchase agreements.
At September 30, 2024, the Company had no borrowings against a 5.0 million line of credit from an unrelated financial institution maturing
on November 1, 2025, with an interest rate that adjusts daily based on the prime rate less 0.50 . This line of credit has covenants specific
to capital and other financial ratios, which the Company was in compliance with at September 30, 2024. The Company also borrowed 5.7
million from the same unrelated financial institution at a fixed rate of 6.15 . This borrowing matures on September 1, 2027 and requires
quarterly principal and interest payments. The original 10.0 million of borrowings was used to fund part of the acquisition of Freedom
Bancshares, Inc. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements. As a provider of financial services, we routinely issue financial guarantees in the form of financial
and performance standby letters of credit. Standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by us generally to guarantee the
payment or performance obligation of a customer to a third party. While these standby letters of credit represent a potential outlay
by us, a significant amount of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon. We have recourse against the customer for any amount
the customer is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit. The letters of credit are subject to the same credit
policies, underwriting standards and approval process as loans made by us. Most of the standby letters of credit are secured, and in
the event of nonperformance by the customers, we have the right to the underlying collateral, which could include commercial real estate,
physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities. The contract amount of these standby letters of
credit, which represents the maximum potential future payments guaranteed by us, was 1.5 million at September 30, 2024. 

At
September 30, 2024, we had outstanding loan commitments, excluding standby letters of credit, of 194.0 million. We anticipate that sufficient
funds will be available to meet current loan commitments. These commitments consist of unfunded lines of credit and commitments to finance
real estate loans. 

Capital .
 Current regulatory capital regulations require financial institutions (including banks and bank holding companies) to meet certain
regulatory capital requirements. The Bank is subject to the Basel III Rules that implemented the Basel III regulatory capital reforms
from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act. The Basel III Rules are applicable to all U.S. banks that are subject to minimum capital requirements, as well as to bank and savings
and loan holding companies other than small bank holding companies (generally, non-public bank holding companies with consolidated
assets of less than 3.0 billion). The Company is considered a small bank holding company and is not directly subject to
these minimum capital requirements. 

The
Basel III Rules require a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted
assets minimum ratio of 6.0 , a Total Capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 8.0 , and a Tier 1 leverage minimum ratio of 4.0 .
A capital conservation buffer, equal to 2.5 common equity Tier 1 capital, is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements
(other than the Tier 1 leverage ratio). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank met the requirements to be well
capitalized, which is the highest rating available under the regulatory capital regulations framework for prompt corrective action.
Management believed that as of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject. 

Dividends .
During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.21 per share to our stockholders. 

The
payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital
pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations. In addition, under the Basel III Rules, financial institutions have
to maintain 2.5 in common equity Tier 1 capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer in order to pay dividends and make other
capital distributions. As described above, the Bank exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of September
30, 2024. The National Bank Act imposes limitations on the amount of dividends that a national bank may pay without prior regulatory
approval. Generally, the amount is limited to the bank s current year s net earnings plus the adjusted retained earnings
for the three preceding years. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 3.3 million was available to be paid as dividends to the Company
by the Bank without prior regulatory approval. 

33 

Additionally,
our ability to pay dividends is limited by the subordinated debentures that are held by three business trusts that we control. Interest
payments on the debentures must be paid before we pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. We have the right to
defer interest payments on the debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters. However, if we elect to defer interest payments, all deferred
interest must be paid before we may pay dividends on our capital stock. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our
assets and liabilities are principally financial in nature, and the resulting net interest income thereon is subject to changes in market
interest rates and the mix of various assets and liabilities. Interest rates in the financial markets affect our decisions relating to
pricing our assets and liabilities, which impact net interest income, a significant cash flow source for us. As a result, a substantial
portion of our risk management activities relates to managing interest rate risk. 

Our
Asset/Liability Management Committee monitors the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet using earnings simulation models. We
have set policy limits of interest rate risk to be assumed in the normal course of business and monitor such limits through our simulation
process. 

We
have been successful in meeting the interest rate sensitivity objectives set forth in our policy. Simulation models are prepared to determine
the impact on net interest income for the coming twelve months, including one using interest rates as of the forecast date, and forecasting
volumes for the twelve-month projection. This position is then subjected to a shift in interest rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points
with an impact to our net interest income on a one-year horizon as follows:

Principal
Amount: 5,000,000.00 
 Date of Agreement: November 1, 2024 

DESCRIPTION
OF EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS. This Change in Terms Agreement is an amendment and/or modification of the terms and conditions of indebtedness
of Borrower as set forth in a Promissory Note dated November 1, 2016, in the amount of 7,500,000.00, and most recently documented in
a Change in Terms Agreement dated November 3, 2023, and shall include all renewals, modifications and extensions of such documents. 

DESCRIPTION
OF CHANGE IN TERMS. As fully set forth herein below, this Change in Terms Agreement generally modifies the terms applicable to the existing
indebtedness by extending the maturity date. Any sums due and owing hereunder shall take into account any principal and interest payments
made by the Borrower in accordance with regular established billing cycles. 

PROMISE
TO PAY. Landmark Bancorp, Inc. Borrower promises to pay to First National Bank of Omaha Lender ), or order,
in lawful money of the United States of America, the principal amount of Five Million 00/100 Dollars 5,000,000.00) or so much
as may be outstanding, together with interest on the unpaid outstanding principal balance of each advance. Interest shall be calculated
from the date of each advance until repayment of each advance. 

PAYMENT.
Borrower will pay this loan in one payment of all outstanding principal plus all accrued unpaid interest on November 1, 2025. In addition,
Borrower will pay regular quarterly payments of all accrued unpaid interest due as of each payment date, beginning December 1, 2024,
with all subsequent interest payments to be due on the same day of each quarter after that. Unless otherwise agreed or required by applicable
law, payments will be applied to interest, principal, and expenses owing under the Note in an order determined by Lender. Borrower will
pay Lender at Lender s address shown above or at such other place as Lender may designate in writing. 

VARIABLE
INTEREST RATE. The interest rate on this loan is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an independent index which
is the U.S. Prime Rate as published by the Wall Street Journal and currently is determined by the base rate on corporate loans posted
by at least seventy percent (70 of the nations ten (10) largest banks (the Index ). The Index is not necessarily the lowest
rate charged by Lender on its loans. Lender will tell Borrower the current Index rate upon Borrower s request. The interest rate
change will not occur more often than each day during the term of the loan. If at any time the Index is less than zero, then it shall
be deemed to be zero for the purpose of calculating the interest rate on the Note. Borrower understands that Lender may make loans based
on other rates as well. The Index currently is 8.000 per annum. Interest on the unpaid principal balance of this loan
will be calculated as described in the INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD paragraph using a rate of 0.500 percentage points under
the Index (the Margin ), adjusted if necessary for any minimum and maximum rate limitations described below, resulting in
an initial rate of 7.500 per annum based on a year of 360 days. If Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that the Index has become
unavailable or unreliable, either temporarily, indefinitely, or permanently, during the term of this loan, Lender may amend this loan
by designating a substantially similar substitute index. Lender may also amend and adjust the Margin to accompany the substitute index.
The change to the Margin may be a positive or negative value, or zero. In making these amendments, Lender may take into consideration
any then-prevailing market convention for selecting a substitute index and margin for the specific Index that is unavailable or unreliable.
Such an amendment to the terms of this loan will become effective and bind Borrower 10 business days after Lender gives written notice
to Borrower without any action or consent of the Borrower. NOTICE: Under no circumstances will the interest rate on this loan be less
than 3.000 per annum or more than the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. 

INTEREST
CALCULATION METHOD. Interest on this loan is computed on a 365/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the interest rate over a
year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding.
All interest payable under this loan is computed using this method. 

1 

PREPAYMENT.
 Borrower may pay without penalty all or a portion of the amount owed earlier than it is due. Early payments will not, unless agreed
to by Lender in writing, relieve Borrower of Borrower s obligation to continue to make payments of accrued unpaid interest. Rather,
early payments will reduce the principal balance due. Borrower agrees not to send Lender payments marked paid in full ,
 without recourse , or similar language. If Borrower sends such a payment, Lender may accept it without losing any of Lender s
rights under this Agreement, and Borrower will remain obligated to pay any further amount owed to Lender. All written communications
concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes payment
in full of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount
must be mailed or delivered to: First National Bank of Omaha, Branch #001, 1620 Dodge St, Omaha, NE 68197. 

LATE
CHARGE. If a payment is 10 days or more late, Borrower will be charged 5.000 of the regularly scheduled payment or 25.00, whichever
is greater. 

INTEREST
AFTER DEFAULT. Upon default, including failure to pay upon final maturity, the interest rate on this loan shall be increased by adding
an additional 6.000 percentage point margin Default Rate Margin ). The Default Rate Margin shall also apply to each succeeding
interest rate change that would have applied had there been no default. However, in no event will the interest rate exceed the maximum
interest rate limitations under applicable law.

 Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement: 

Payment
Default. Borrower fails to make any payment when due under the Indebtedness. 

Other
Defaults. Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement

3 

CONTINUING

evidenced or securing the obligation(s), remain unchanged and in full force and effect. Consent by Lender to this Agreement does not
waive Lender s right to strict performance of the obligation(s) as changed, nor obligate Lender to make any future change in terms.
Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a satisfaction of the obligation(s). It is the intention of Lender to retain as liable parties
all makers and endorsers of the original obligation(s), including accommodation parties, unless a party is expressly released by Lender
in writing. Any maker or endorser, including accommodation makers, will not be released by virtue of this Agreement. If any person who
signed the original obligation does not sign this Agreement below, then all persons signing below acknowledge that this Agreement is
given conditionally, based on the representation to Lender that the non-signing party consents to the changes and provisions of this
Agreement or otherwise will not be released by it. This waiver applies not only to any initial extension, modification or release, but
also to all such subsequent actions.

cannot properly verify identity within 30 calendar days, Lender reserves the right to deem all of the balance and accrued interest due
and payable immediately. 

ELECTRONIC
COPIES. Lender may copy, electronically or otherwise, and thereafter destroy, the originals of this Agreement and/or Related Documents
in the regular course of Lender s business. All such copies produced from an electronic form or by any other reliable means (i.e.,
photographic image or facsimile) shall in all respects be considered equivalent to an original, and Borrower hereby waives any rights
or objections to the use of such copies. 

CHANGE
IN MEMBERSHIP. If Borrower or Guarantor is a limited liability company, any change in ownership of twenty-five percent (25 or more
of the membership interest of Borrower or Guarantor is an Event of Default. 

CROSS
DEFAULT. An Event of Default, beyond the applicable cure period, if any, or an Event of Default under any other Loan or any Related
Document will constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement and a default and an Event of Default under any other agreement by
Borrower or any affiliate or subsidiary of Borrower with or in favor of Lender and under any evidence of any Loan or Indebtedness held
by Lender, whether or not such is specified therein. Borrower acknowledges that some Loan Documents will e preprinted forms and that
it is the intent of Borrower and Lender that all Loans and Guaranties by Borrower or any affiliate or subsidiary of Borrower with or
in favor of Lender be cross-defaulted with each other. 

SUCCESSORS
AND ASSIGNS. Subject to any limitations stated in this Agreement on transfer of Borrower s interest, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns. If ownership of the Collateral becomes vested in
a person other than Borrower, Lender, without notice to Borrower, may deal with Borrower s successors with reference to this Agreement
and the Indebtedness by way of forbearance or extension without releasing Borrower from the obligations of this Agreement or liability
under the Indebtedness. 

MISCELLANEOUS
PROVISIONS. If any part of this Agreement cannot be enforced, this fact will not affect the rest of the Agreement. Lender may delay
or forgo enforcing any of its rights or remedies under this Agreement without losing them. Borrower and any other person who signs, guarantees
or endorses this Agreement, to the extent allowed by law, waive presentment, demand for payment, and notice of dishonor. Upon any change
in the terms of this Agreement, and unless otherwise expressly stated in writing, no party who signs this Agreement, whether as maker,
guarantor, accommodation maker or endorser, shall be released from liability. All such parties agree that Lender may renew or extend
(repeatedly and for any length of time) this loan or release any party or guarantor or collateral; or impair, fail to realize upon or
perfect Lender s security interest in the collateral; and take any other action deemed necessary by Lender without the consent
of or notice to anyone. All such parties also agree that Lender may mod 1fy this loan without the consent of or notice to anyone
other than the party with whom the modification is made. The obligations under this Agreement are joint and several.
