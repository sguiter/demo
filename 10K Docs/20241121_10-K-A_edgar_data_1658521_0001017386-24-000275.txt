REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Mountain Top Properties, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Mountain Top Properties, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the two years ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the two years ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 

Substantial doubt about the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered
recurring losses since inception, has a shareholders deficit, and the Company and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized
source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time these factors raise substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

A critical audit matter is a matter arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee or the
Company s governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved
our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating a critical audit, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. We determined that there are no critical audit
matters communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

Financial assets and liabilities recorded
at fair value in our balance sheet, are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy established by GAAP, which prioritizes the inputs
used to measure fair value into the following levels: 

Level 1 Quoted market prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 

 Level 2 Quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active;
or other inputs that are observable and can be corroborated by observable market data. 

 Level 3 Inputs reflecting management's
best estimates and assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The inputs
are unobservable in the market and significant to the valuation of the instruments. 

A financial instrument's categorization
within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

 The Company follows ASC 820 s financial
instruments consist of accounts payable and amounts provided to the Company from related parties. The carrying amount of financial instruments

Less: Valuation Allowance 

Deferred Tax Assets - Net 

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately
 of federal and state net operating loss carryovers NOLs ), which begin to expire in 2042. Utilization of the NOLs
may be subject to limitation under the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 should there be a greater than 50 ownership change as determined
under regulations. 

In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance
against the entire deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax
asset will not be realized.

as of December 31, 2023. The Company currently has limited liquidity and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. These factors among others, raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. The Company will require additional financing moving forward and is pursuing various strategies to accomplish this, including seeking equity funding and/or debt funding from private placement sources. Although management believes that it will be able to obtain the necessary funding to allow the Company to remain a going concern through the methods discussed above, there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful. 

Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of December 31, 2023, which is the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were, in design and operation, effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2023. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting consists of policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) are designed and operated
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and our process for the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Our management evaluated
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the "COSO Framework"). Based on our management s
evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d)

reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, as specified above. Our management recognizes that any control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its
objectives will be met.
