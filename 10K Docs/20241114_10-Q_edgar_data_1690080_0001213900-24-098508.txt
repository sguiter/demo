180 Life Corp. 180 ,
f/k/a 180 Life Sciences Corp. and CannBioRx Life Sciences Corp.) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and was incorporated in
the State of Delaware on January 28, 2019. The Company is located in the United States U.S. and is a medical
pharmaceutical company focused upon unmet medical needs in the areas of inflammatory diseases, fibrosis, and chronic pain by employing
innovative research and, where appropriate, combination therapies, through 180 s three wholly-owned subsidiaries, 180 Therapeutics
L.P. 180 LP ), CannBioRex Pharmaceuticals Corp. CBR Pharma ), and Katexco Pharmaceuticals Corp. Katexco ). 180 LP, CBR Pharma and Katexco are together, the 180 Subsidiaries. Katexco was incorporated
on March 7, 2018 and CBR Pharma was incorporated on March 8, 2018, under the provisions of the British Corporation Act of British Columbia.
180 LP was formed as a limited partnership on September 6, 2013, in Delaware. Additionally, 180 s wholly-owned subsidiaries Katexco
Callco, ULC, Katexco Purchaseco, ULC, CannBioRex Callco, ULC, and CannBioRex Purchaseco, ULC were formed in the Canadian Province of
British Columbia on May 31, 2019 to facilitate the acquisition of Katexco, CBR Pharma and 180 LP. On July 1, 2021, the assets and liabilities
of the Canadian companies (Katexco and CBR Pharma) were transferred to their respective subsidiaries, which are Katexco Pharmaceuticals
Corp. Katexco U.S. and CannBioRex Pharma Limited CBR Pharma U.K. ). 

The Company is a clinical
stage biotechnology company focused on the development of therapeutics for unmet medical needs in chronic pain, inflammation, fibrosis,
and other inflammatory diseases. We have three product development platforms: 

fibrosis and anti-tumor necrosis factor TNF 

drugs which are derivatives of cannabidiol CBD or cannabigerol CBG analogues SCAs and 

alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 7nAChR ). 

Due to restrictions in the
Company s resources, the Company has slowed down research and development activities significantly in the SCA platform and the
anti-TNF platform. The Company has not made progress on the 7nAChR platform and has suspended further research and development
activity in this program. 

The Company is currently
evaluating all options to monetize its existing assets, in addition to exploring other strategic alternatives to maximize value for its
stockholders. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated by the Company as part of this process include, but
are not limited to, an acquisition, merger, reverse merger, other business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other strategic
transactions involving the Company. 

On September 29, 2024, the
Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Elray Resources, Inc. Elray ).
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Elray agreed to sell us certain source code and intellectual property relating to a back-end
technology platform which is a key component of creating an online blockchain casino (the Purchased Assets Elray
agreed to provide support and assistance to the Company in connection with the building and launching of a fully operational casino operation
utilizing the Purchased Assets.

and a working capital deficit of , and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a net loss of 
and cash used in operating activities of . The Company expects to invest a significant amount of capital to commercialize its
iGaming assets as well as continuing to fund research and development of the Company s existing biotechnology assets. On September
29, 2024, the Company acquired certain source code and intellectual property relating to an online blockchain casino and plans to build
and launch a fully operational casino operation as part of its future operations. The Company expects to invest a significant amount
of capital to fund the development and operation of this business, including but not limited to acquisition or development of a front-end 
user interface, sourcing of one or more games, acquiring relevant licenses and investing in marketing. As a result, the Company expects
that its operating expenses will increase significantly, and consequently will require significant revenues to become profitable. Even
if the Company does become profitable, it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The Company
cannot predict when, if ever, it will be profitable. There can be no assurance that the intellectual property of the Company, or other
technologies it may acquire, will meet applicable regulatory standards, obtain required regulatory approvals, will produce products capable
of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs, or be successfully marketed. 

These condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern for a reasonable period of time, which is defined as within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements
are issued. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on
the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related
to our ability to continue as a going concern.

(which consisted of carrying amounts of and
 related to the Company s CBR Pharma subsidiary and its 180 LP subsidiary, respectively). Per the valuation obtained
from a third party as of 2022 year-end, the fair market value of the Company s IP R D assets was determined to be (which
consisted of fair values of and related to the Company s CBR Pharma subsidiary and 180 LP subsidiary, respectively).
As of that measurement date, the carrying values of the CBR Pharma and 180 LP subsidiaries assets exceeded their fair market values
by and , respectively. As such, management determined that the consolidated IP R D assets were impaired
by and, in order to recognize the impairment, the Company recorded a loss for this amount during the fourth quarter of
2022, which appeared as a loss on IP R D asset impairment on the income statement. This reduced the IP R D asset balances of
its CBR Pharma subsidiary and its 180 LP subsidiary to and , respectively, as of December 31, 2022; and the
total consolidated IP R D asset balance was after impairment. 

(which consisted of a balance related to the Company s
180 LP subsidiary); the Company typically assesses asset impairment on an annual basis unless a triggering event or other facts or circumstances
indicate that an evaluation should be performed at an earlier date. As of September 30, 2023, the Company assessed the then most recent
delays in its commercialization timeline, general economic conditions, industry and market considerations, the Company s financial
performance and all relevant legal, regulatory, and political factors that might indicate the possibility of impairment and concluded
that, when these factors were collectively evaluated, it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The Company recorded a loss
in the amount of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which appears as a loss on impairment to IP R D
assets on the income statement. As a result, as of September 30, 2023, the carrying amount of the IP R D assets on the balance sheet
became nil ).

Assets closed on September 30, 2024. 

Based on the terms of the Series
B Preferred Stock and the Purchase Agreement, and in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC) 480-10, the instruments are accounted for as a liability due to the variable number of shares issuable under the agreement
pursuant to the conversion terms. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock liability
in aggregate was . The Company estimated the fair value of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock based on the market value
of the underlying common shares into which the Series B Convertible Preferred stock is convertible into at the transaction date, and an
estimated fair value of the liquidation preference using option pricing models for scenarios of the liquidation preference being in effect
or conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock by the holder. 

The Purchase Warrants have
an exercise price of per share, the closing stock price of the Company s common stock on the last trading day prior to the

, together with interest, attorneys fees and costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in
its legal action. 

On October 5, 2021, Dr. Krauss
and the KBL Affiliates filed an Answer, Counterclaims and Third-Party Complaint against the Company and twelve individuals who are, or
were, directors and/or officers of the Company , i.e ., Marc Feldmann, Lawrence Steinman, James N. Woody, Teresa DeLuca,
Frank Knuettel II, Pamela Marrone, Lawrence Gold, Donald A. McGovern, Jr., Russell T. Ray, Richard W. Barker, Shoshana Shendelman and
Ozan Pamir (collectively, the Third-Party Defendants ). On February 24, 2022, Dr. Krauss filed an amended
Answer, Counterclaims and Third-Party Complaint (the Amended Counterclaims ), which, among other things, dismissed
Teresa DeLuca, Frank Knuettel II, Pamela Marrone, Russell T. Ray, Richard W. Barker and Shoshana Shendelman. In essence, the
Amended Counterclaims allege that the Company and the remaining Third-Party Defendants made alleged misstatements against Dr. Krauss
in SEC filings, failed to register her shares in the Company so that they could be traded, and failed to pay to Dr. Krauss the amounts
alleged to be owing under a promissory note in the principal amount of , plus an additional under Dr. Krauss s
resignation agreement. On April 19, 2022, Dr. Krauss stipulated to dismiss all of her counterclaims against both Donald A. McGovern,
Jr. and Lawrence Gold. 

On June 25, 2024, Dr. Krauss
filed a Motion for partial summary judgment on her claim that the Company failed to register her shares. The Company has not yet responded
to such Motion, and no hearing date has yet been set. Discovery has not yet commenced in the case. The Company and the remaining
Third-Party Defendants intend to continue to vigorously defend against all the Amended Counterclaims, however, there can be no assurance
that they will be successful in the legal defense of such Amended Counterclaims. 

Action Against the Company by Dr. Krauss 

On August 19, 2021, Dr. Krauss
initiated legal action in the Chancery Court of Delaware against the Company. The Complaint alleged that the Company is obligated
to advance expenses including, attorney s fees, to Dr. Krauss for the costs of defending against an SEC investigation and
Subpoenas, and that the Company is also required to reimburse Dr. Krauss for the costs of bringing this lawsuit against the Company. On
September 3, 2021, Dr. Krauss filed an Amended Complaint which further alleged that Dr. Krauss is also allegedly entitled to advancement
by the Company of her expenses, including attorney s fees, for the costs of defending against the Third-Party Complaint in the
Tyche action referenced below, and the costs of defending against the Company s own Complaint against Dr. Krauss as described above. On
or about September 23, 2021, the Company filed its Answer to the Amended Complaint in which the Company denied each of Dr. Krauss 
claims and raised numerous affirmative defenses. 

On November 15, 2021, Dr.
Krauss filed a Motion for Summary Adjudication as to certain of the issues in the case, which was opposed by the Company. On March 7,
2022, the Court issued a decision denying the Motion in part and granting it in part. The Court then issued an Order implementing
such decision on March 29, 2022. The parties subsequently engaged in proceedings as set forth in that Order, and the Company
was required to pay a portion of those fees while objecting to the remaining portion of disputed fees. On October 10, 2022 and January
18, 2023, Dr. Krauss filed applications to compel the Company to pay the full amount of fees requested by Dr. Krauss for May-October
2022, and to modify the Court s Order. On May 3, 2023, the Court issued an Order granting both of Dr. Krauss s Applications
for payment of attorney s fees totaling , which amount was paid in May 2023.

. 

On or about May 17, 2021,
Tyche responded to the Company s Complaint by filing an Answer and Counterclaims against the Company alleging that it was the Company,
rather than Tyche, that had breached the Subject Guarantee. Tyche also filed a Third-Party Complaint against six third-party defendants,
including three members of the Company s then management, Sir Marc Feldmann, Dr. James Woody, and Ozan Pamir (collectively, the
 Individual Company Defendants ), claiming that they allegedly breached fiduciary duties to Tyche with regards to
the Subject Guarantee. 

On November 23, 2021, the
Court granted the Company s request to issue an Order of attachment against all of Tyche s shares of the Company s
stock that had been held in escrow. In so doing, the Court found that the Company had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the
merits of the case based on the facts alleged in the Company s Complaint. 

On February 18, 2022, Tyche
filed an Amended Answer, Counterclaims and Third-Party Complaint. On August 25, 2022, the Court granted the Company s Motion
to Dismiss each of the Individual Company Defendants, and also three of the four Counterclaims brought against the Company, leaving only
Tyche s declaratory relief claim. On August 26, 2022, Tyche filed a Motion to vacate or modify the Company s existing attachment
Order against Tyche s shares of the Company s stock held in escrow, however, the Court summarily denied such Motion on January
3, 2023. Although Tyche subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal as to that denial, on May 4, 2023, the Appellate Court unanimously affirmed
the ruling of the lower Court in the Company s favor. 

On January 30, 2023, the
Company filed a Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment. In hearings held on September 11 and 19, 2023, the Court granted the Company s
Motion, but referred the question as to the amount of the Company s damages against Tyche to a special referee. Tyche filed a Notice
of Appeal as to the Court s ruling. 

On June 30, 2024, the Company
entered into a written Settlement Agreement with Tyche and Ronald Bauer Samantha Bauer to fully resolve this action with Tyche
and the Bauer action referenced below. The Settlement Agreement has been fully signed, and the parties are currently engaged in performing
its terms, which include, among other things, transfer to the Company of Tyche s shares of the Company s stock in escrow,
transfer to the Company of shares of the Company s stock held by Theseus Capital Ltd. and Astatine Capital Ltd., forgiveness of
loans to the Company by the Bauer Defendants, exoneration of the Company s bond in the Tyche action, complete mutual releases
of all claims and counterclaims in both actions, and dismissal of both the Tyche action and the Bauer action in their entireties. As
a result of forgiveness of loans payable to the Bauer Defendants totaling , and accrued interest of , as well as release
of the Company s bond, the Company recognized a gain of during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included
in Gain on Settlement of Liabilities on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. 

15 

million in compensatory damages, and punitive damages. In addition,
the Company brought a Third-Party Complaint against its excess insurance carrier, Freedom Specialty Insurance Company Freedom seeking declaratory relief that Freedom will also be required to honor its policy coverage as soon as the amount of AmTrust s insurance
coverage obligations to the Company has been exhausted. On October 25, 2022, AmTrust filed its Answer to the Company s Counterclaims
and, on October 27, 2022, Freedom filed its Answer to the Third-Party Complaint. 

On November 22, 2022,
the Company filed a Motion for Summary Adjudication against both AmTrust and Freedom. The Motion was fully briefed and a hearing
was held on March 9, 2023. The standard to prevail on a Motion for Summary Adjudication in the Court is high to prevail and requires
a judge to find that there are no disputed issues of fact so that they can rule on the issues as a matter of law. In this instance the
judge found three major issues could be decided as a matter of law in the Company s favor and that one issue, the Change in Control
exclusion, requires further discovery. 

On April 21, 2023, the Court
issued an Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part the Company s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. 

Specifically, the Court granted
summary adjudication in favor of the Company on the following issues: (a) that the Company is, in fact, an insured under both the AmTrust
and Freedom insurance policies; (b) that certain SEC subpoena related expenses for defendants Dr. Marlene Krauss, the Company s
former Chief Executive Officer and Director, and George Hornig, the former Chairman of the Board, are within the basic scope of coverage
under both the AmTrust and Freedom insurance policies; and (c) that the Insured vs. Insured exclusion relied upon by AmTrust and Freedom
is not applicable to bar any such coverage. 

The Court also found that
there were issues of disputed facts as to the Change in Control exclusion contained within the policies, which therefore precluded the
Court from granting the remainder of the Company s requests for summary adjudication as a matter of law. Accordingly, the Court,
at that time, denied the Company s further requests for summary adjudication and deemed that for the time being, the Change in
Control issue is to be determined at the time of trial, in order to find that the policies (i) provide coverage for the fees which the
Company has advanced and will advance to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig; (ii) that AmTrust has breached the policy; (iii) that
AmTrust must pay such expenses of the Company; and that, once the AmTrust policy has been exhausted, (iv) Freedom will be obligated to
pay such expenses of the Company pursuant to its policy. 

16 

million in reimbursement of fees which the Company has advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig,
of which the Company received million after the payment of attorney s fees. On May 9, 2024, AmTrust paid the Company
 in reimbursement of fees which the Company had advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig, and the Company has received
 after the payment of attorney s fees. 

The Company, Freedom and
Amtrust held a mediation conference on August 21, 2024, during which, the Company agreed to the terms of a settlement with Freedom, pursuant
to which Freedom agreed to pay to the Company, of which the Company received approximately after the payment of legal
fees. 

On September 23, 2024, Freedom
paid the Company a further in reimbursement of fees advanced by the Company, of which the Company received after the
payment of attorney s fees. On September 5, 2024, the Company and Freedom executed a mutual release agreement. The total of 
is included in other income on the Company s unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 

Amtrust and the Company have
commenced written discovery proceedings against each other and anticipate that depositions will also occur. The Company intends to continue
to vigorously pursue this matter in order to establish the Company s entitlement to full and final payment by AmTrust of the subject
advancement expenses of the Company. While the Company continues to believe it has a strong case against AmTrust, there can be no assurance
that the Company will prevail in this action. The final outcome of the litigation is unknown at this time and such final outcome could
be materially adverse to the Company.

adjusted, using the 1-for-19 ratio. In addition, the exercise price for each outstanding stock option and warrant was increased in inverse
proportion to the 1-for-19 split ratio such that upon an exercise, the aggregate exercise price payable by the optionee or warrant holder
to the Company for the shares subject to the option or warrant will remain approximately the same as the aggregate exercise price prior

equity requirement as of December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 or June 30, 2024. 

Nasdaq provided the Company
until January 2, 2024 to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance. We submitted the plan to regain compliance in a timely manner,
and on January 11, 2024, Nasdaq advised the Company that it has determined to grant the Company an extension to regain compliance with
the Equity Rule. 

The terms of the extension
were as follows: on or before May 13, 2024, the Company must have completed certain transactions described in greater detail in the compliance
plan, contemplated to result in the Company increasing its stockholders equity to more than million, and opt for one of the
two following alternatives to evidence compliance with the Equity Rule: Alternative 1: The Company must have furnished to the SEC and
Nasdaq a publicly available report (e.g., a Form 8-K) including: 1. A disclosure of the Staff s deficiency letter and the
specific deficiency(ies) cited; 2. A description of the completed transaction or event that enabled the Company to satisfy the stockholders 
equity requirement for continued listing; and 3. An affirmative statement that, as of the date of the report, the Company believed it
had regained compliance with the stockholders equity requirement based upon the specific transaction or event referenced in Step
2; or Alternative 2: The Company must furnish to the SEC and Nasdaq a publicly available report including: 1. Steps 1 2 set forth
above; 2. A balance sheet no older than 60 days with pro forma adjustments for any significant transactions or event occurring on or
before the report date; and 3. That the Company believes it satisfies the stockholders equity requirement as of the report date.
The pro forma balance sheet must have evidenced compliance with the stockholders equity requirement. 

Additionally, in either case
the Company was required to disclose that Nasdaq will continue to monitor the Company s ongoing compliance with the stockholders 
equity requirement and, if at the time of its next periodic report the Company does not evidence compliance, that it may be subject to
delisting. 

Separately, on May 14, 2024,
the Staff provided us notice of our non-compliance with the audit committee requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital
Market set forth in Listing Rule 5605(c)(2), which requires that listed companies maintain an audit committee of at least three independent
directors. Nasdaq provided the Company a cure period in order to regain compliance as follows: until the earlier of the Company s
next annual shareholders meeting or May 7, 2025; or if the next annual shareholders meeting is held before November 4,
2024, then the Company must evidence compliance no later than November 4, 2024. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by
the applicable date above, Nasdaq rules require the Staff to provide written notification to the Company that its securities will be
delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel. The Company is currently seeking out
qualified independent directors to serve on the Company s audit committee and plans to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5605(c)(2)
in the near future. 

While the Company was able
to undertake some of the transactions described in the Equity Rule compliance plan, it was unable to regain compliance with the Equity
Rule prior to the end of the plan period (May 13, 2024). As a result, on May 14, 2024, the Company received a delist determination letter
from the Listing Qualifications department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the Staff advising the Company
that the Staff had determined that the Company did not meet the terms of the extension. Specifically, the Company did not complete its
proposed transactions and was unable to file a Current Report Form 8-K by the May 13, 2024 deadline previously required by the Staff,
evidencing compliance with the Equity Rule. On May 17, 2024, the Company requested an appeal of the Staff s delisting determination,
and on May 20, 2024, the Staff advised the Company that the delisting action referenced in the Staff s determination letter had
been stayed, pending a final written decision by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel Panel ). On July 2, 2024, the Company
received notice that the Panel had determined to grant the Company s request to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market,
subject to the Company meeting certain conditions, including filing on or before July 31, 2024, a public disclosure describing the transactions
undertaken by the Company to achieve compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing rules and demonstrate long-term compliance with
the Equity Rule and providing an indication of its equity following those transactions. On July 22, 2024, the Panel granted the
Company s request for additional time to achieve compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing rules and demonstrate long-term
compliance with the Equity Rule. Specifically, the Hearings Panel subsequently extended that deadline to September 30, 2024, and subsequently
extended such deadline further to October 15, 2024, to regain compliance with the Equity Rule and to allow the continued listing of the
Company s common stock and warrants on The Nasdaq Stock Market through such date, subject to the Company s compliance with
the Equity Rule on or prior to such date. 

22 

shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and Purchase Warrants, on October 4,
2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq confirming that we had regained compliance with the Equity Rule. Nasdaq also advised the Company
that in application of Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), the Company will be subject to a mandatory panel monitor for a period of one year
from the date of such letter. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the Staff finds that the Company is no longer in compliance
with the Equity Rule, then, notwithstanding Rule 5810(c)(2), the Company will not be permitted to provide the Staff with a plan of compliance
with respect to such deficiency and the Staff will not be permitted to grant additional time for the Company to regain compliance with
respect to such deficiency, nor will the Company be afforded an applicable cure or compliance period pursuant to Rule 5810(c)(3). Instead,
the Staff will issue a Delist Determination Letter and the Company will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial
Panel or a newly convened Hearings Panel if the initial Panel is unavailable. The Company will have the opportunity to respond/present
to the Hearings Panel as provided by Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(C) and the Company s securities may at that time be delisted from
Nasdaq. 

If the Company s common
stock and public warrants are delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company s common stock and public warrants
or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company s common stock and public warrants could suffer a material decline.
Delisting could also impair the Company s ability to raise capital and/or trigger defaults and penalties under outstanding agreements
or securities of the Company. 

Notwithstanding the above,
the Company remains out of compliance with the audit committee requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq set forth in Listing Rule
5605(c)(2), which requires that listed companies maintain an audit committee of at least three independent directors, as discussed above.
The Company is currently seeking qualified independent Board members and hopes to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5602(c)(2) in the
near future.

General Information 

The following discussion
is based upon our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report, which have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Factors that could cause
or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Report, and in other reports we file with the
SEC, and in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. All references to years relate to the calendar year ended December 31st of the
particular year.

Going Concern and Management Liquidity Plans 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had an accumulated deficit of 129,238,340 and a working capital deficit of 5,158,449, and for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, a net loss of 1,894,683 and cash used in operating activities of 529,906. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As we are not generating revenues, we need to raise a significant
amount of capital in order to pay our debts and cover our operating costs. While the Company raised money in August 2021, July 2022,
December 2022 and April 2023, August 2023 and November 2023 (see Note 2 Going Concern and Management s Plans); on April
16, 2024, AmTrust paid the Company 2.27 million in reimbursement of fees which the Company had advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George
Hornig for indemnification as former officers and directors, of which the Company received 1.5 million after the payment of attorney s
fees; on May 9, 2024, AmTrust paid the Company an additional 300,140 in reimbursement of fees which the Company had advanced to Dr.
Marlene Krauss and George Hornig, of which the Company received 200,093 after the payment of attorneys fees; pursuant to the
terms of a settlement with Freedom on September 23, 2024. Freedom agreed to pay 125,000 to the Company, of which the Company received
approximately.

We are subject to all the
substantial risks inherent in the development of a new business enterprise within an extremely competitive industry. Due to the absence
of a long-standing operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, we anticipate operating losses until
we can successfully implement our business strategy, which includes all associated revenue streams. We may never achieve profitable operations
or generate significant revenues. 

We currently have a minimum
monthly cash requirement of approximately 200,000, which is required to support the Company s operations. We believe that in the
aggregate, we will require significant additional capital funding to complete the commercialization of our back-end blockchain casino
assets, including but not limited to acquisition or development of a front-end user interface, sourcing of one or more
games, acquiring relevant licenses and investing in marketing, support and expand the research and development and marketing of our products,
fund future clinical trials, repay debt obligations, provide capital expenditures for additional equipment and development costs, payment
obligations, office space and systems for managing the business, and cover other operating costs until our planned revenue streams from
products are fully-implemented and begin to offset our operating costs, if ever. 

Since our inception, we have
funded our operations with the proceeds from equity and debt financings. We have experienced liquidity issues due to, among other reasons,
our limited ability to raise adequate capital on acceptable terms. We have historically relied upon the issuance of equity and promissory
notes that are convertible into shares of our common stock to fund our operations and have devoted significant efforts to reduce that
exposure. We anticipate that we will need to issue equity to fund our operations and repay our outstanding debt for the foreseeable future.
If we are unable to achieve operational profitability or we are not successful in securing other forms of financing, we will have to
evaluate alternative actions to reduce our operating expenses and conserve cash. 

The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report also include a going concern footnote. 

Additionally, wherever possible,
our Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash
consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock.
Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, but subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations (which
generally require shareholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20 of our then outstanding
shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20 of our then outstanding shares of stock, subject to certain exceptions),
to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common
stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future.
These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders, may further dilute common stock book value,
and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management s ability to maintain control of
us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.

Business Overview 

Biotechnology Product
Development 

This MD A and the related
financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, primarily cover the operations of 180, which is
a clinical stage biotechnology company headquartered in Palo Alto, California, focused on the development of therapeutics for unmet medical
needs in chronic pain, inflammation, fibrosis and other inflammatory diseases. We have three product development platforms: 

fibrosis and anti-tumor necrosis factor TNF 

drugs which are derivatives of cannabidiol CBD or cannabigerol CBG analogues SCAs and 

alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 7nAChR ). 

Due to restrictions in the
Company s resources, the Company has slowed down research and development activities significantly in the SCA platform and the
anti-TNF platform, and the Company has not made progress in the 7nAChR platform and has suspended further research and development
activity in this program in the meantime. 

The Company is currently
evaluating all options to monetize its existing assets, in addition to exploring other strategic alternatives to maximize value for its
stockholders. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated by the Company as part of this process include, but
are not limited to, an acquisition, merger, reverse merger, other business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other strategic
transactions involving the Company.

Asset Purchase Agreement 

On September 29, 2024, we
entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Elray Resources, Inc. Elray ).
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Elray agreed to sell us certain source code and intellectual property relating to an online blockchain

deemed relevant by Hempstead Co., LLC, as set forth in such opinion, the purchase price to be paid by the Company was fair, from
a financial point of view, to the Company, which opinion was received verbally on September 29, 2024, which conditions to closing were
either satisfied or waived by the parties on September 30, 2024. 

32 

The acquisition contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement closed on September 30, 2024 (the Closing and such date, the Closing Date ). 

Following the Closing, Elray

acknowledging that the Company will require a front end (the Front-End Development ). Following the Closing, at the
request of the Company, Elray and the Company shall negotiate in good faith to come to agreement on an arrangement whereby Elray will,
for an additional cost agreed to by Elray, help the Company complete the Front-End Development, or at the request of the Company, Elray

at a cost to be agreed between such vendor and the Company, in the Company s sole discretion. The Company has sole discretion to
determine which, if any, vendor it retains for the Front End Development. 

The Purchase Agreement also
restricts Elray, in perpetuity, from copying, selling, assigning, hypothecating, or otherwise transferring the Purchased Assets to any
other party, without the prior written consent of the Company, and provides for the Company to be the sole owner of the Purchased Assets,
except that Elray shall be authorized to retain and use the Purchased Assets for its own benefit and utilize such assets to provide SAAS
solutions and hosted casino solutions to third party companies. 

Pursuant to the Purchase

on September 30, 2024, we granted warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock to Elray pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase
Warrant (the Warrant Agreement ). The Purchase Warrants have an exercise price of 1.68 per share, the closing stock
price of the Company s common stock on the last trading day prior to the parties entry into the Purchase Agreement, and
a term of seven years (through September 30, 2031). The Purchase Warrants also provide for cashless exercise rights. No shares of common
stock may be issued upon exercise of the Purchase Warrants until or unless the Company has received Stockholder Approval. 

Series B Convertible Preferred Stock 

On September 30, 2024, in
contemplation of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, and pursuant to the power provided to the Company

Plan of Operations Regarding
iGaming Assets 

We are planning to strategically
enter into the online gaming industry, utilizing the Purchased Assets, i.e., our newly acquired back-end gaming platform,
which incorporates blockchain technology and full cryptocurrency operability (the Gaming Technology Platform ). The
Company plans to use this technology platform to establish a blockchain-based business aimed at the global iGaming market. Initially
focusing on B2C (business-to-consumer) online casinos, the Company also plans to expand into a B2B (business-to-business) model, offering
a seamless blockchain-enabled technology platform for gaming operators worldwide. In addition, management has identified certain global
iGaming industry characteristics and trends that they believe make potential acquisition opportunities attractive. Management believes
that the combination of the Gaming Technology Platform and the strength of a Nasdaq listing make the Company an attractive consolidation
vehicle for the iGaming industry, and plan to work to identify potential acquisitions (although no targets exist at present). 

A. 
 The Gaming Technology Platform 

The Gaming Technology Platform
includes advanced components designed to support online casinos using blockchain technology. These components are as follows: 

1. 
 Blockchain Casino Operations Back-End : A robust infrastructure designed to support casino
 game programming through secure and scalable server/cloud solutions, database management, and blockchain payment processing. 

2. 
 Blockchain to FIAT Seamless Exchange Technology : A proprietary system allowing players to
 deposit and withdraw using cryptocurrency, while maintaining FIAT-based wallets and gaming sessions. We believe that this cutting-edge
 technology offers a significant competitive advantage in the growing blockchain casino market. 

3. 
 Blockchain API Technology : A sophisticated application program interface (API) that facilitates
 reliable FIAT-to-blockchain and blockchain-to-FIAT payment gateways, supporting credit cards, e-wallets, and multiple cryptocurrencies
 while enabling blockchain-exclusive online casino operations. 

4. 
 Player Account Management : A secure system for managing player accounts, including registration,
 login, and player profiles, alongside know-your-client (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance features. 

35 

5. 
 Loyalty Systems for Blockchain Users : A customer relationship management system designed to
 foster player loyalty and enhance the lifetime value of each customer by catering to blockchain users. 

6. 
 Affiliate Tracking System : A tool to monitor traffic, registrations, and referral sources,
 allowing for scalable growth through affiliate partnerships and the distribution of referral fees and royalties. 

At the heart of the acquisition
of the Gaming Technology Platform is proprietary source code, as well as specialized implementation know-how, much of which will be transferred
from Elray to the Company, as detailed below. Management intends to further develop both the proprietary source code, enhancing and expanding
the commercial potential of the Gaming Technology Platform, as well as continue to build expertise in the operation of the Gaming Technology
Platform. Management believes that the existing Gaming Technology Platform, plus future potential enhancements, provide a strong competitive
barrier, and position the Company well as the iGaming industry moves towards both greater cryptocurrency acceptance, and the safety of
blockchain enabled platforms. 

B. 
 Industry Background 

The global iGaming casino
market has rapidly ascended as a major player in the digital entertainment industry, experiencing remarkable growth fueled by technological
advancements, increased internet penetration, and evolving consumer preferences. According to a report by Statista, the global online
gaming sector is estimated to reach 97 billion in 2024, and is projected to grow to nearly 133 billion by 2029. The
cryptocurrency-based iGaming sector is growing even faster, albeit from a smaller base value, with SOFTSWISS estimating growth of over
20 between 2022 and 2023 for crypto-based bets, propelled by the increasing adoption of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum,
which offer more secure, faster, and lower-cost transactions. 

Regionally, Europe leads
the market, accounting for over 45 of the global iGaming market share in 2022, according to Global Market Insights, thanks to well-established
regulatory frameworks in key countries such as the UK, Malta, and Sweden. In North America, research by Statista shows that the U.S.
market has seen exponential growth following a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court case which struck down the federal ban on sports betting, which
has led to an expansion in both online casino and sports betting offerings across multiple states. The U.S. iGaming market is projected
to reach 39.8 billion by 2029, growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8 , compared to projected revenue of 25 billion
in 2024, according to Statista, driven primarily by sports betting and casino games. Canada is also emerging as a lucrative market
due to favorable regulatory changes, contributing to North America s strong growth. 

Latin America has also become
a rapidly expanding market, with countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia at the forefront. The region s iGaming market is
expected to grow at a CAGR of over 13 from 2022 to 2028, driven by increased mobile internet usage and the gradual liberalization of
gambling laws. Meanwhile, Asia and Africa, although still relatively nascent in the iGaming sector, are expected to hold
significant potential. The Asian market, led by countries such as India and Japan, could see a surge in online gaming revenues due to
rising smartphone penetration and regulatory shifts. Statista notes that India alone is expected to reach 2.9 billion in online gambling
revenue by 2024, growing at a 6 CAGR to just under 4 billion by 2029. Africa, with its expanding mobile infrastructure, is another
emerging market, particularly in countries like South Africa and Nigeria. 

The types of games contributing
to this growth are diverse. Online casinos comprising slots, table games, and live dealer games dominate the iGaming market,
contributing to over 37 of total market revenues in 2024 according to Statista. Sports betting is another key growth
sector, with mobile sports betting estimated to account for around 70 of the sports betting market in many regions as early as 2020
according to Grand View Research. Management believes that this trend will continue, particularly in South America, Africa
and parts of Asia as mobile penetration increases. Grand View Research also estimates that the global sports betting market will grow
at a CAGR of 10-12 from 2023 to 2030, reaching 180 billion in revenue by 2030. Additionally, eSports betting is seeing rapid adoption,
appealing particularly to younger demographics. According to Market Research Future, the eSports betting market is expected to grow from
 9.9 billion in 2022 to over 30 billion by 2032. Management believes that much of this growth will come from the growing
popularity of eSports, plus the continued proliferation of mobile devices, especially in Latin America, Asia and Africa. 

36 

Management believes that
the future of the iGaming market is filled with opportunities. Cryptocurrency adoption in online casinos offers not only reduced transaction
costs but also faster processing times and increased privacy, which we believe are highly appealing to modern gamers. The use of blockchain
technology is also expected to bring about greater transparency and trust, with provably fair gaming systems becoming increasingly popular.
Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are also expected to revolutionize the user experience, making online gambling more immersive.
We also expect that the mobile gaming sector will continue to grow as mobile devices become more powerful and widely accessible, especially
in emerging markets. 

Management has conducted
preliminary research, and identified a number of elements which require ongoing monitoring as the Company works to commercialize its
first online casino. First, Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the biggest challenges, as governments in different regions continue
to establish or modify laws governing online gambling. Second, cybersecurity threats are also a growing concern, given the increasing
sophistication of cyberattacks targeting online casinos and payment systems, which by the very nature of the underlying business, offer
prime opportunity for security and personal information breaches. Third, there is heightened scrutiny around social responsibility, with
a focus on gambling addiction and the need for responsible gaming measures, which could lead to tighter regulations in various jurisdictions.
Management believes the Company s Gaming Technology Platform, which management believes will allow for significant customer interaction,
will help the Company address this risk. Competition in the market is fierce, with operators constantly investing in new technologies
and marketing to attract and retain customers, further increasing operational costs, all of which will require the Company to continue
to invest heavily in both the Gaming Technology Platform and other growth opportunities. 

C. 
 B2C Focus: Blockchain-Enabled Online Casinos 

Our immediate focus is on launching
B2C online casino operations in high-growth international markets . The Company s innovative blockchain technology enhances
transparency and operational efficiency, providing players with a secure and trustworthy gaming experience, which management believes
will be a key differentiator. Key features of this platform include: 

Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain technology ensures secure, immutable transaction records,
 boosting player trust and confidence in the platform. 

Seamless Cryptocurrency Integration: Players can deposit and withdraw funds using cryptocurrency
 while maintaining FIAT (traditional currency) wallets and gaming sessions, catering to the growing demand for crypto-friendly platforms. 

Superior User Experience: 180 s customer relationship management (CRM) system is
 designed to enhance player loyalty and increase the lifetime value of customers through personalized engagement and targeted promotions. 

Management is focused on
three steps to operationalize the launch of the Company s first online casino. First, the Company is working to source a front-end 
customer interface, which is required for operation and commercialization of the Gaming Technology Platform, with plans to evaluate multiple,
competitive potential suppliers of customer facing products and to acquire or create a front-end , funding permitting. Second,
management is evaluating certain well known and high governance gaming jurisdictions to pursue initial licensing no final determination
has yet been made as to which jurisdiction(s) to pursue. Finally, management is beginning to evaluate a variety of games, which in the
iGaming industry are generally sourced from third-party suppliers, to populate the planned front-end customer interface. See below for
further details on management s projected commercialization timeline. 

37 

Currency-Agnostic Play and Gaming Variety 

Management believes that
a standout feature of the Gaming Technology Platform is its ability to offer currency-agnostic play, enabling customers to easily switch
between traditional FIAT currencies and cryptocurrencies during gaming sessions. Management believes this flexibility makes the customer
interaction experience better, and therefore makes the Company s ultimate gaming content accessible to a wider audience and supports
a more seamless gaming experience for both traditional and crypto-savvy players. In addition, the Gaming Technology Platform is designed
to support a wide variety of games, ranging from traditional offerings such as live casino games, including poker and blackjack, to newer
rapid-play games such as crash games, as well as potentially in the future, live sports betting, all of which we believe appeal to the
evolving preferences of today s global players. We are confident that this blend of game styles will provide a comprehensive gaming
experience, catering to the fast-changing tastes of both casual and high-frequency players across different markets. 

High-Growth iGaming Jurisdictions 

We expect to launch our planned
B2C casino operations in established and high-growth markets where iGaming is gaining traction. Although the Company has not yet determined
its first launch jurisdiction, it is currently analyzing the following five, high potential jurisdictions to select one or more launch
jurisdictions: 

1. 
 Germany : We believe that the recent regulation of online casinos in Germany has opened up
 significant opportunities in one of Europe s largest gaming markets. 

2. 
 Brazil : As one of Latin America s largest and fastest-growing economies, Brazil is a
 promising market for iGaming, driven by increasing internet access and evolving regulations. 

3. 
 India : India s rapidly expanding online user base and growing interest in online casinos
 make it a high-potential iGaming market. 

4. 
 Canada : With provinces such as Ontario regulating iGaming, Canada offers an expanding market
 for operators to enter the online casino space. 

5. 
 Colombia : As one of the first Latin American countries to regulate online gambling, Colombia
 is a key emerging market with what we believe is a strong potential for growth in the iGaming sector. 

Commercialization Strategy and Timeline 

The commercialization strategy
for launching the Company s initial online casino is planned to follow a structured approach to work to ensure a smooth, compliant,
and profitable rollout. The first step involves the completion of the technology transfer, where all purchased assets, including software
and intellectual property representing the Gaming Technology Platform, are securely transferred to the Company s storage infrastructure.
Management currently anticipates that this will be a primary cloud-based server, with a physical server backup. This period is expected
to include setting up the necessary server configurations, network security, and data integration which we expect to occur during the
next 90 to 120 days. During this phase, management of the Company will be fully immersed in the technical aspects of the transfer process
to ensure a seamless transition. 

Concurrently with the technology
transfer phase, management will be working to develop and enhance a comprehensive business strategy to guide the Company s new
focus on the iGaming sector. This strategy is planned to include selecting suitable web domains for one or more online casinos; creating
relevant websites through the use of experienced casino front-end development teams; defining target customer markets and
groups, including evaluation and selection of target customer demographics; and evaluation of content offerings, considering target markets
and customer segments. Regulatory and compliance reviews are also an essential part of the comprehensive business strategy, as the iGaming
business is highly regulated, with a trend to increasing regulatory scrutiny. This will be particularly important as the Company prepares
its initial license application (see below) in one or more jurisdictions. Finally, the Company plans to lay the foundation for customer
service solutions, which management believes are a critical component of the customer experience with iGaming. 

38 

Following the technology
transfer phase, and running concurrently with the business strategy development phase, management intends to complete a full technology
development review, ensuring that the Gaming Technology Platform fully aligns with business goals and meets the latest industry standards
in terms of cybersecurity, information protection and reliability. Any potential gaps, such as development needs or cybersecurity updates,
will be identified and addressed within this phase. Following the technology review, front-end development will then begin, which will
focus on creating a user-friendly and functional gaming site. This phase may involve evaluating possible third-party solutions or self-developed
solutions, giving careful consideration to costs and timing. While evaluating front-end solutions, management also intends to simultaneously
evaluate potential gaming solutions. In the iGaming sector, games are generally sourced from third-party suppliers on a revenue share
basis. Management will evaluate games based on selected target markets and client groups, as well as carefully considering cost and reliability
of any potential game offerings. 

Evaluation of licensing regimes
will also be a critical component of the overall launch strategy, and management plans to focus on securing a reputable and cost-efficient
license which will allow the casino to legally operate. Related to licensing, management will also focus on ensuring full compliance
with all necessary Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulation and requirements, both from an industry perspective
but also those unique to the chosen licensing jurisdictions. 

The marketing plan development
will be another significant milestone, focusing on identifying and attracting customers through affiliate marketing, direct marketing,
and other channels. Critical metrics like Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) are expected to be evaluated
to ensure profitability for each potential market and customer group. The business strategy will also seek to explore how to build a
loyal customer base and position the casino against competitor by using the Company s Technology Gaming Platform, which has a built
in customer loyalty functionality. 

As the business begins to
scale, assembling a growth team of senior management across marketing, technology, compliance, and other areas will be vital. This team
will attempt to manage the casino s expansion and oversee the daily operations. During this phase, establishing internal business
processes for anti-money laundering, know your customer, accounting, taxation, and responsible gambling tracking will be key to ensuring
long-term success and regulatory compliance. Business continuity, disaster recovery, and cybersecurity protocols are also expected to
be implemented during this period. 

Before launching, integration
and testing will seek to ensure that all components of the casino front-end, back-end, games, and marketing work seamlessly
together. This testing phase will be necessary to ensure everything is aligned for the official go-live, where the website will launch
to the public. During the live testing period following the launch, the team will monitor performance, customer engagement, and feedback,
making necessary adjustments to optimize the platform and ensure customer satisfaction. 

Management believes that
this structured approach, covering technology, business strategy, licensing, game selection, marketing, and internal processes, will
provide a robust roadmap to operationalize the Technology Gaming Platform. Management is targeting having the first online casino fully
operational and optimized for growth by the end of Q1 2025, although there can be no guarantee that all elements of the commercialization
strategy will be completed on this timeline lack of funding, slower than anticipated evaluation and contracting, and difficulty
sourcing one or more key components could all contribute to delays. 

Legal and Regulatory 

As management evaluates the
Company s first jurisdiction for licensing, it will evaluate multiple options to seek to find the best combination of cost-effectiveness,
market acceptability, and high reputation with transparency. The Company currently plans to assess jurisdictions like Curacao, known
for its affordable licensing fees and relatively quick approval process, making it attractive for a swift market entry. However, more
reputable and highly regulated jurisdictions such as Malta and the Isle of Man will also be considered, as they often offer greater transparency,
strong consumer trust, and better access to European markets, though at a higher cost and stricter compliance requirements. Gibraltar
could also be an option due to its favorable tax regime and robust regulatory framework. 

39 

Management plans to evaluate
each jurisdiction based on licensing costs, annual fees, tax rates, regulatory ease, and the ability to serve key target markets. Transparency
and oversight will be critical, as the Company seeks to build credibility in the highly competitive iGaming sector. Ultimately, the jurisdiction
chosen will not only be picked to offer the best balance of cost and reputation, but to also align most closely with the Company s
target launch markets, ensuring that the license supports our efforts for a successful and compliant entry into those regions. 

Projected Costs 

Management believes that
the estimated costs to commercialize an online iGaming casino can vary significantly, depending on the jurisdiction and the scale of
the operation, but some key expenses are universal (and somewhat fixed), while others are variable and depend on decisions made by management
around business strategy. Costs that management expects to incur, given that the Company has already acquired the Gaming Technology Platform,
are expected to include the following: first, sourcing a front-end player interface involves either purchasing or developing a customized
platform. Off-the-shelf solutions from iGaming software developers typically start at around 100,000, but can increase dramatically
for bespoke or highly tailored platforms. Second, partnerships with game providers require initial setup fees, licensing, and revenue-sharing
agreements. These costs may range from 10,000 to over 100,000 per game, depending on the scope of the partnership and the range of
games offered. Third, management believes that ensuring a smooth user experience, quality design, and strong cybersecurity are essential,
which can also add to the initial outlay, with estimated costs of around 500,000. 

Based on research undertaken
by management to date, an online casino requires a robust marketing budget, often requiring at least 1-2 million in the first year to
build brand recognition through digital advertising, influencer partnerships, affiliate programs, and promotions. Establishing legal
and regulatory compliance frameworks adds another layer of cost. In regulated markets, obtaining licenses from gaming authorities can
range from 50,000 to over 200,000 per jurisdiction, depending on the region, with ongoing costs for renewal. Legal and regulatory consultants,
particularly in complex markets, will require ongoing fees, which could be 20,000 to 100,000 annually. Hiring experienced senior staff
like a Chief Compliance Officer, legal experts, and marketing heads will further add to the budget. Salaries for top-tier executives
can range from 250,000 to 300,000 annually, making human resources one of the largest ongoing expenses. Regulatory assistance to navigate
licensing audits and compliance can add up to another 100,000 annually. Together, these elements make the initial commercialization
of an online iGaming casino a significant but potentially lucrative investment. 

In total, management believes
that the initial cost to fully commercialize the Gaming Technology Platform, with a license in one key jurisdiction, ten games and an
adequate marketing and administrative budget, ranges from 3 million to more than 5 million. We currently have limited cash on hand
and expect that we will need to raise this funding through debt or equity funding in the future, which funding may not be available on
favorable terms, when required, or at all. 

D. 
 B2B Focus: Blockchain-Enabled Technology Platform 

Management is also evaluating
the potential future ability to expand into the global online gaming B2B (business-to-business) market by creating and launching a blockchain-enabled
platform aimed at providing gaming operators with a cutting-edge, transparent, and secure solution for running their operations. This
move would be a potential strategic extension of our newly acquired Gaming Technology Platform, leveraging the benefits of our newly
acquired blockchain technology to offer innovative tools that enhance operational efficiency, player trust, and business growth for operators
worldwide. 

Blockchain Technology: Enhancing Trust and
Security 

At the core of our potential
B2B offering is our advanced blockchain technology, which provides significant advantages for gaming operators. Blockchain s decentralized
and immutable nature ensures transparent and secure transaction records, allowing operators to build stronger trust with their players.
Every gaming transaction, from deposits and withdrawals to bets and payouts, is recorded on the blockchain, creating an auditable trail
that enhances accountability and reduces the risks of fraud or manipulation. Management believes that players are currently demanding
increased accountability from gaming operators and have an enhanced focus on potential fraud in the online gaming market globally. 

40 

This increased transparency
also simplifies regulatory compliance, as operators can provide clear, verifiable records to regulators in real-time. By offering a platform
that integrates blockchain-enabled gaming infrastructure, we expect to help allow operators to position themselves as trustworthy and
compliant, which is essential in the highly regulated gaming industry. The regulation of online gaming, cryptocurrencies and online transactions
generally is converging across jurisdictions, and management believes that our emerging technology has a strong potential to address
these key challenges for operators. 

Seamless Cryptocurrency and FIAT Currency
Support 

One of the key features of
our Gaming Technology Platform is our currency-agnostic framework, which supports both cryptocurrency and traditional FIAT currencies.
This flexibility provides operators with the ability to cater to a diverse global audience. As cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum
continue to gain popularity, especially among younger and tech-savvy players, our platform enables operators to attract this growing
demographic by offering seamless crypto-based transactions. According to SOFTSWISS, cryptocurrency based wagering accounted for 27.5 
of bets placed in the iGaming industry in 2023, with substantial differences in adoption between various markets. 

At the same time, our Gaming
Technology Platform also supports FIAT currency transactions to cater to traditional players who prefer to use government-issued currencies.
This dual currency model is expected to enable operators to broaden their player base while offering an enhanced, user-friendly experience
that adapts to the evolving preferences of players globally. We believe that the ability to use both crypto and FIAT wallets within a
single platform would give operators a competitive edge in offering flexible financial options to their users. 

Consumer Relationship Management 

The Company s Gaming
Technology Platform also includes sophisticated tools such as a built-in customer relationship management (CRM) system, which would enable
operators to optimize player engagement and retention. By providing data-driven insights and personalized interactions, operators are
expected to be able to increase the lifetime value of their players, fostering long-term growth and loyalty. 

While management is focused
on developing the B2C business as an initial priority, the potential ability to use the Company s Gaming Technology Platform to
expand to B2B sources of revenue in the future is of strong interest, and we believe has the potential to provide a valuable source of
differentiated revenue for 180 down the road. 

E. 
 Go-Forward Consolidation Strategy 

Finally, management believes
that we are uniquely positioned to act as a consolidator in the gaming industry, capitalizing on our Nasdaq listing, highly experienced
management team and Board, and robust Gaming Technology Platform. As a publicly-traded company, our Nasdaq listing provides us with access
to capital markets and a well-recognized stock currency, which we anticipate will allow us to efficiently fund potential future acquisitions.
We hope that this liquidity advantage will allow us to acquire private gaming companies (both B2C and B2B) at attractive valuations,
especially in a market where private firms may lack similar access to capital. Management believes that the global iGaming industry is
entering a period of rapid consolidation, and that potentially attractive acquisition opportunities in key jurisdictions could become
available in the future. At present, management has identified several potential targets, but is still conducting preliminary diligence
and has no immediate acquisition plans. 

We think that management s
experience across multiple industries, combined with a strategic vision for iGaming, enhances our ability to identify and integrate undervalued
gaming companies. We plan to work to ensure that future acquisitions are not only executed effectively but also yield synergistic benefits
that contribute to accretive growth. By incorporating these companies into our advanced Gaming Technology Platform, either as technology
components or users of the technology, we hope to be able to optimize operational efficiencies, expand our geographic and market reach,
and enhance our technological offerings, with our goal of positioning the Company as a leader in the evolving iGaming sector.

Significant Financial Statement Components 

Research and Development 

To date, 180 s research
and development expenses have related primarily to discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical development of its three product platforms:
fibrosis and anti-TNF; drugs which are derivatives of CBD, and 7nAChR. Research and development expenses consist primarily of
costs associated with those three product platforms, which include: 

expenses incurred under agreements with 180 s collaboration partners and third-party contract
 organizations, investigative clinical trial sites that conduct research and development activities on its behalf, and consultants; 

costs related to production of clinical materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers; 

laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of preclinical and clinical trials; 

employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; and 

facilities and other expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation
 and amortization expense and other supplies. 

We expense all research and
development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We accrue for costs incurred as services are provided by monitoring the
status of each project and the invoices received from our external service providers. We adjust our accrual as actual costs become known.
When contingent milestone payments are owed to third parties under research and development arrangements or license agreements, the milestone
payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. 

Research and development
activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development
costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical
trials. We expect that research and development expenses will increase over the next several years as clinical programs progress and
as we seek to initiate clinical trials of additional product candidates. It is also expected that increased research and development
expenses will be incurred as additional product candidates are selectively identified and developed. However, it is difficult to determine
with certainty the duration and completion costs of current or future preclinical programs and clinical trials of product candidates. 

The duration, costs and timing
of clinical trials and development of product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the
following: 

per patient trial costs; 

the number of patients that participate in the trials; 

the number of sites included in the trials; 

the countries in which the trials are conducted; 

the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; 

the number of doses that patients receive; 

42 

the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; 

potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; 

the impact of COVID-19 and other health pandemics on our trials; 

the duration of patient follow-up; and 

the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidates. 

In addition, the probability
of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial
viability. We will determine which programs to pursue and fund in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate,
as well as an assessment of each product candidate s commercial potential. 

Because the product candidates
are still in clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts
necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability.
Due to the early-stage nature of these programs, we do not track costs on a project-by-project basis. As these programs become more advanced,
we intend to track the external and internal cost of each program. 

Commercialization of
Technology Gaming Platform 

Management believes that
the estimated costs to commercialize an online iGaming casino can vary significantly, depending on the jurisdiction and the scale of
the operation, but some key expenses are universal (and somewhat fixed), while others are variable and depend on decisions made by management
around business strategy. Costs that management expects to incur, given that the Company has already acquired the Gaming Technology Platform,
are expected to include the following: first, sourcing a front-end player interface involves either purchasing or developing a customized
platform. Off-the-shelf solutions from iGaming software developers typically start at around 100,000, but can increase dramatically
for bespoke or highly tailored platforms. Second, partnerships with game providers require initial setup fees, licensing, and revenue-sharing
agreements. These costs may range from 10,000 to over 100,000 per game, depending on the scope of the partnership and the range of
games offered. Third, management believes that ensuring a smooth user experience, quality design, and strong cybersecurity are essential,
which can also add to the initial outlay, with estimated costs of around 500,000. 

Based on research undertaken
by management to date, an online casino requires a robust marketing budget, often requiring at least 1-2 million in the first year to
build brand recognition through digital advertising, influencer partnerships, affiliate programs, and promotions. Establishing legal
and regulatory compliance frameworks adds another layer of cost. In regulated markets, obtaining licenses from gaming authorities can
range from 50,000 to over 200,000 per jurisdiction, depending on the region, with ongoing costs for renewal. Legal and regulatory consultants,
particularly in complex markets, will require ongoing fees, which could be 20,000 to 100,000 annually. Hiring experienced senior staff
like a Chief Compliance Officer, legal experts, and marketing heads will further add to the budget. Salaries for top-tier executives
can range from 250,000 to 300,000 annually, making human resources one of the largest ongoing expenses. Regulatory assistance to navigate
licensing audits and compliance can add up to another 100,000 annually. Together, these elements make the initial commercialization
of an online iGaming casino a significant but potentially lucrative investment. 

In total, management believes
that the initial cost to fully commercialize the Gaming Technology Platform, with a license in one key jurisdiction, ten games and an
adequate marketing and administrative budget, ranges from 3 million to more than 5 million. 

43 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative
expenses consist primarily of salaries and other staff-related costs, including stock-based compensation for shares of common stock issued
and options granted to founders, directors and personnel in executive, commercial, finance, accounting, legal, investor relations, facilities,
business development and human resources functions and include vesting conditions. 

Other significant general
and administrative costs include costs relating to facilities and overhead costs, legal fees relating to corporate and patent matters,
litigation, SEC filings, insurance, investor relations costs, fees for accounting and consulting services, and other general and administrative
costs. General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred, and we accrue amounts for services provided by third parties related
to the above expenses by monitoring the status of services provided and receiving estimates from our service providers and adjusting
our accruals as actual costs become known. 

It is expected that the general
and administrative expenses will increase over the next several years to support our both our continued research and development activities
as they relate to our existing biotechnology assets, and also the commercialization of our Technology Gaming Platform, including but
not limited to front-end platforms, technology development and protection, marketing expenses and licensing. These increases are anticipated
to include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, developing commercial infrastructure, fees to outside consultants,
lawyers and accountants, as well as expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and
SEC requirements, insurance and investor relations costs. 

Other Income 

Other income primarily represents
fees earned for research and development work performed for other companies, some of which are related parties. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense consists
primarily of interest expense related to debt instruments. 

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities 

Change in fair value of derivative
liabilities represents the non-cash change in fair value of derivative liabilities during the reporting period. Losses resulting from
changes in fair value of derivative liabilities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were driven by increases in
stock price during the periods, resulting in a higher fair value of the underlying liability.

Research and Development 

We incurred research
and development expenses of 251,577 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 972,113 for the three months ended September
30, 2023, representing a decrease in research and development expenses of 720,536 or 74 . The decrease in research and development expense
includes a) an overall decrease in research and development (R D) program spending based on Company resource allocation and b) a
reduction in stock-based compensation of approximately 80,000. 

Research and Development Related Parties 

We incurred research and
development expenses related parties of 151,138 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 132,880 for the
three months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 18,258, or 14 . The increase is attributable to a UK R D tax
credit that was received in 2023 (which reduced the 2023 expenses) that was not earned in 2024. 

General and Administrative 

We incurred general and administrative
expenses of 576,378 and 2,433,194 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of
 1,856,816 or 76 for the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period. The decrease resulted from reduced professional fees of approximately
 636,000 from lower consulting and accounting fees, reduced insurance expense of 338,000, reduced salaries expense of approximately
 264,000 from reduced headcount in connection with lower overall operations in the current period and a reduction in stock-based compensation
expense of approximately 548,000. The decline in stock compensation is primarily due to previous awards being fully vested in 2023
and no significant new grants within the past year. 

Other Income (Expense), Net 

We incurred other income,
net of 142,373 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other expense, net of 9,072,598 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase in other income, net of 9,214,971 or 102 . The increase is primarily attributable
to an impairment to IP R D assets in the prior year of approximately 9.1 million (see Note 3 IP R D, under Part
I Item 1. Financial Statements in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Net Income (Loss) 

We had net loss of 836,720
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss 10,265,760 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing
a decrease in net loss of 9,429,040 or 92 , for the reasons discussed above, primarily the insurance proceeds received.

Research and Development 

We incurred research
and development expenses of 1,105,086 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to research and development expenses of
 2,339,863 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease in expenses of 1,234,777 or 53 . The decrease in research
and development expenses includes a reduction in stock-based compensation of approximately 242,000 and an overall decrease in R D
program spending based on Company resource allocation. 

Research and Development Related Parties 

We incurred research and
development expenses related parties of 455,345 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 481,027 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of 25,682, or 5 , which was mainly the result of an overall decrease in R D
program spending based on Company resource allocation. 

General and Administrative 

We incurred general and administrative
expenses of 3,357,868 and 9,204,122 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of
 5,846,254 or 64 for the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period. The decrease resulted from reduced legal fees of approximately 1.1
million from lower activity related to ongoing litigation in the current period, reduced professional fees of approximately 2.0 million
from lower consulting and accounting fees, reduced salaries expense of approximately 857,000 from a reduction in headcount and a reduction
in stock-based compensation expense of approximately 1.2 million. The decline in stock-based compensation is primarily due to
previous awards being fully vested in 2023 and no significant new grants within the past year. 

Other Income Expense, Net 

We incurred other income,
net of 3,023,616 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other expense, net of 9,028,020 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase in other income, net of 12,051,636 or 133 . The increase is primarily attributable
to an impairment to IP R D assets in the prior year of approximately 9.1 million (see Note 3 IP R D, under Part
I Item 1. Financial Statements in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), 1,712,804 in proceeds
received from AmTrust, a gain on settlement of liabilities with a lender of 156,928, and a gain of 1,039,364 from settlements with
certain R D contractors (see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters, to the notes to unaudited consolidated
financial statements included above under Part I Financial Information Item 1. Financial Statements). 

Net Loss 

We had a net loss of 1,894,963
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18,708,007 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease
in net loss of 16,813,324 or 90 , for the reasons discussed above. 

46 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, we had cash balances of 194,920 and 1,975,799, respectively, and working capital deficits of 5,158,449 and
 1,422,710, respectively, largely due to a decrease in cash related to cash used in operations. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used in operating activities was 529,906 and 8,762,209, respectively. Our cash used in operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to our net loss of 1,894,683, adjusted for non-cash expenses
in the aggregate amount of 329,672, as well as 1,035,105 of net cash used to fund changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities.
Our cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to our net loss of 18,708,007, adjusted
for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of 578,437 as well as 1,461,235 of net cash provided by changes in the levels of operating
assets and liabilities. A significant portion of the non-cash expenses during the period relates to approximately 9.1 million of non-recurring
expenses associated with the impairment of IP R D assets (see Note 3 IP R D, under Part I Item 1. Financial
Statements in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as a decrease in the deferred tax benefit
in the amount of 2.3 million. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was 1,005,367 and cash provided by financing activities was 4,439,526 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to repayments
of loans in the amount of 1,005,856, offset by proceeds of 489 from the exercise of pre-funded warrants related to the Amendment to
the August 2023 Offering (defined and described below under Prior Financial Transactions Amendment to August 2023 Offering ).
Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to net proceeds of 5,424,701 from the
April 2023 Offering and August 2023 Offering, partially offset by the repayment of loans in the amount of 985,175. 

Our
product candidates may never achieve commercialization and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.
We expect that our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures will continue to
increase. As a result, until such time, if ever, as we are able to generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash
needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses
and other similar arrangements, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity or debt securities,
if accomplished, may result in dilution to our then stockholders. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be,
compensation and related expenses, third-party clinical research and development services, license payments or milestone obligations
that may arise, laboratory and related supplies, clinical costs, potential manufacturing costs, legal and other regulatory expenses and
general overhead costs. In addition, we expect that the online casino assets that were acquired in September 2024 will be operational
and ready to be launched between the first and second quarter of 2025. 

Our material cash requirements
and time periods of such requirements from known contractual and other obligations include milestone and royalty payments related to
license agreements with Oxford University and Yissum, payments related to the director and officer insurance, payments to consultants
and payments related to outside consulting firms, such as legal counsel, auditors, accountants, etc. As to the online casino, we expect
that the cash requirements include front end development, purchase and leasing of games, integration of games, data capture and interpretation,
currency management, cybersecurity and back office tracking of activity. These cash requirements, in the aggregate, are expected to amount
to approximately 750,000 for the remainder of 2024 and 2,000,000 for 2025. 

Further,
our operating plans may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials
and other research and development activities. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. Because of the numerous
risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the
amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated product development programs. 

47 

We have not yet achieved
profitability and expect to continue to incur cash outflows from operations. It is expected that our research and development and general
and administrative expenses will continue to increase and, as a result, we will eventually need to raise additional capital to fund our
operations. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue
operations or obtain funds by entering into financing agreements on unattractive terms. Our operating needs include the planned costs
to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2024, the conditions
outlined above indicated that there was a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the
financial statement issuance date. While the Company raised money in August 2021, July 2022, December 2022 and April 2023, August 2023
and November 2023 (see Note 2 Going Concern and Management s Plans); on April 16, 2024, AmTrust paid the Company 2.27
million in reimbursement of fees which the Company had advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig for indemnification as former
officers and directors, of which the Company received 1.5 million after the payment of attorney s fees; on May 9, 2024, AmTrust
paid the Company an additional 300,140 in reimbursement of fees which the Company had advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig,
of which the Company received 200,093 after the payment of attorneys fees; pursuant to the terms of a settlement with Freedom
and the Company, Freedom agreed to pay 125,000 to the Company, of which the Company received approximately 83,333 after the payment
of legal fees in August 2024; on September 23, 2024, Freedom paid the Company a further 125,000 in reimbursement of fees advanced by
the Company, of which the Company received 76,639 after the payment of attorney s fees; and in October 2024, the Company received
 3,320,331 before deducting financial advisory fees and other expenses payable by us in connection with the exercise of the Existing
Warrants (see Note 13 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included above under Part I Financial
Information Item 1. Financial Statements ), we expect to require additional funding in the future
and there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional needed capital or that such capital will be available under favorable
terms. In the event that we do raise capital in the future, we anticipate it being from the sale of equity which may cause dilution to
existing stockholders. With current cash on hand of approximately 3.3 million as of October 23, 2024, the Company expects to be
able to continue as a going concern through December 2025. 

Our condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP ), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the condensed consolidated
financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Prior Financing Transactions 

April 2023 Offering 

On April 5, 2023, the Company
entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate of 21,053
shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 61,615 shares of common stock April 2023 Pre-Funded
Warrants ), and common stock warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 82,668 shares of common stock (the April
2023 Common Warrants ), at a combined purchase price of 36.29 per share and warrant (the April 2023 Offering ).
Aggregate gross proceeds from the April 2023 Offering were 2,999,882. Net proceeds to the Company from the offering, after deducting
the placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately 2.7 million. The placement agent fees
and offering expenses of approximately 300,000 were accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in capital. The April 2023 Offering

August 2023 Offering 

On August 9, 2023, the Company
entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor (the Purchaser ), in addition to certain
purchasers who relied on the Company s registration statement filed with the SEC on July 25, 2023, which became effective on August
9, 2023, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate of 35,102 shares of common stock (the August 2023 Shares ),
pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 207,814 shares of common stock August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants ),
and common stock warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 242,915 shares of common stock (the August 2023 Common Warrants ),
at a combined purchase price of 12.35 per share and warrant (the August 2023 Offering ). Aggregate gross proceeds
from the August 2023 Offering were 2,999,606. Net proceeds to the Company from the offering, after deducting the placement agent fees
and other offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately 2.7 million. The placement agent fees and offering expenses of
approximately 300,000 were accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in capital. The August 2023 Offering closed on August 14,
2023.

Amendment to August 2023 Offering 

On October 11, 2023, the
Company received a letter from Nasdaq, stating that Nasdaq had determined that the Company failed to comply with Nasdaq s shareholder
approval requirements set forth in Listing Rule 5635(d), which requires prior shareholder approval for transactions, other than public
offerings, involving the issuance of 20 or more of the pre-transaction shares outstanding at less than the Minimum Price. The letter
from Nasdaq referred to the August 2023 Offering and requested the Company to submit a plan of compliance no later than November 27,
2023. On November 9, 2023, the Company submitted a plan of compliance to Nasdaq, and on November 14, 2023, Nasdaq provided a letter of
extension to the Company. 

Pursuant to the compliance
plan submitted to Nasdaq, on November 28, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the August 2023 Offering Amendment
to the August 2023 Offering ), whereby (i) the Purchaser agreed to pay an additional 830,769 in connection with the repricing
of the August 2023 Shares and August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants (the Repricing Amount ), (ii) the Company agreed to
issue to the Purchaser additional pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 257,205 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of 0.0019
per share (the Additional Pre- Funded Warrants ), and warrants to purchase up to 477,058 shares of common stock,
with an exercise price of 3.23 per share (the Additional Common Warrants , and collectively with the Additional
Pre-Funded Warrants, the Additional Warrants ), and (iii) the Company and the Purchaser agreed to enter into a warrant
amendment agreement (as described below). Net proceeds to the Company from the repricing, after deducting the placement agent fees and
other offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately 0.8 million. The placement agent fees and offering expenses of approximately
 60,000 were accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in capital. The Amendment to the August 2023 Offering closed on December
1, 2023. 

In accordance with the Amendment
to the August 2023 Offering, the Company entered into a warrant amendment agreement to amend the following outstanding warrants held
by the Purchaser: (i) warrants to purchase up to 16,138 shares of common stock issued in July 2022; (ii) warrants to purchase up to 135,339
shares of common stock issued in December 2022; (iii) warrants to purchase up to 82,668 shares of common stock issued in April 2023;
and (iv) warrants to purchase up to 242,915 shares of common stock issued in August 2023 (collectively, the Existing Common
Warrants ). Pursuant to the warrant amendment agreement, the Existing Common Warrants were not exercisable until the Company
obtained stockholder approval for the issuance of up to 477,058 shares of common stock upon exercise of the Existing Common Warrants.
The Existing Common Warrants have an exercise price equal to 3.23 per share, and the Existing Common Warrants will expire on the fifth
anniversary of the stockholder approval date, February 16, 2024. 

Warrant Inducement Agreement and Related
Transactions 

On
October 16, 2024, we entered into a warrant inducement agreement (the Inducement Agreement with a holder (the Holder of 477,058 Additional Common Warrants and 473,011 of the Existing Common Warrants (collectively, the Exercised Warrants ),
pursuant to which the Holder agreed to exercise for cash the Exercised Warrants to purchase 950,069 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of 3.48 per share 0.25 greater than the 3.23 per share exercise price of such Exercised Warrants) during the period from the
date of the Inducement Agreement until 1:15 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 16, 2024. On October 16 and 17, 2024, the Exercised Warrants
were exercised in full for cash by the Holder and the Company received 3,306,240 before deducting financial advisory fees and other
expenses payable by us. 

In
consideration of the Holder s agreement to exercise the Exercised Warrants in accordance with the Inducement Agreement, the Company
agreed to issue new unregistered Warrants to Purchase Shares of Common Stock (the New Warrants to purchase a number
of shares of common stock equal to 200 of the number of shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the Exercised Warrants, i.e.,
warrants to purchase up to 1,900,138 shares of common stock (the New Warrant Shares ). The New Warrants were immediately
exercisable and have a term of exercise of five years. 

49 

The
Company agreed in the Inducement Agreement to file a registration statement on Form S-1 to register the resale of the New Warrant Shares
upon exercise of the New Warrants (the Resale Registration Statement by November 15, 2024, and to use commercially
reasonable efforts to have such Resale Registration Statement declared effective by the Commission within sixty (60) calendar days following
the date of filing with the Commission (or ninety (90) calendar days following the date of filing with the Commission in the event of
a full review by the Commission) and to keep the Resale Registration Statement effective at all times until no holder of
the New Warrants owns any New Warrants or New Warrant Shares. In the event that the Company fails to timely deliver to the Holder the
New Warrant Shares without restrictive legends, the Company has agreed to pay certain liquidated damages to the Holder. 

The
Company expects to use the net proceeds from these transactions to advance the commercialization of the technology gaming platform
recently acquired by the Company, and for working capital, and other general corporate purposes. 

The
New Warrants will have an exercise price of 1.50 per share. The exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon
exercise of each New Warrant are subject to appropriate adjustments in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock
splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the common stock. In addition, in certain circumstances, upon
a fundamental transaction, a holder of New Warrants will be entitled to receive, upon exercise of the New Warrants, the kind and amount
of securities, cash or other property that such holder would have received had they exercised the New Warrants immediately prior to the
fundamental transaction. 

The
Company may not affect the exercise of New Warrants, and the applicable Holder will not be entitled to exercise any portion of any such
New Warrant, which, upon giving effect to such exercise, would cause the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned
by the holder of such New Warrant (together with its affiliates) to exceed 4.99 or 9.99 , as applicable, of the number of shares of
common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with
the terms of such New Warrants. 

The
Company engaged A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners A.G.P. to provide exclusive financial services in connection with
the transactions summarized above and, pursuant to a Financial Advisory Agreement between the Company and A.G.P., paid A.G.P. a financial
advisory fee of 232,000, an alternative transaction fee of 100,000. In addition, we reimbursed A.G.P. for its accountable legal expenses
in connection with the exercise of the Exercised Warrants and the issuance of the New Warrants of 65,000 and 10,000 non-accountable
expenses. In addition, we paid A.G.P. 29,923.08 half of the financial advisory fees due in connection with a December 2023 warrant inducement.
As of October 31, 2024, a total of 436,923 related to the aforementioned transaction has been paid to A.G.P and there is no balance
outstanding. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The Company s condensed
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of its assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. The Company has identified certain estimates as critical to its
business operations and the understanding of its past or present results of operations related to intangible assets. These estimates
are considered critical because they had a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact, on the Company s
condensed consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates.
The Company believes that the estimates, judgments and assumptions made when accounting for the items described below were reasonable,
based on information available at the time they were made. However, actual results may differ from those estimates, and these differences
may be material. 

Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets consist
of source code and intellectual property relating to an online blockchain casino acquired on September 29, 2024 (the Purchased Assets)
and licensed patents held by Katexco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as well as technology licenses acquired in connection
with the July 2019, corporate restructuring completed between the Company and each of 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma, pursuant to which
each of 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the Reorganization ). The
casino technology and intellectual property is amortized over an estimated useful life of three years. Licensed patents are amortized
over the remaining life of the patent. Technology licenses represent the fair value of licenses acquired for the development and commercialization
of certain licenses and knowledge. The technology licenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
the underlying patents. It will be necessary to monitor and possibly adjust the useful lives of the licensed patents and technology licenses
depending on the results of the Company s research and development activities.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Management does not believe
that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the
Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

Pursuant to Item 305(e) of
Regulation S-K 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller
reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have established and maintain
a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Interim Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (principal financial and accounting
officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

The Company s management
evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period
covered by this Report. 

In designing and evaluating
our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure
controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based on their evaluation,
our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose
in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures as of
September 30, 2024. 

Management s evaluation
was based on the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: 

Ineffective controls: The Company s review and control procedures did not operate at
 the appropriate level of precision to determine that reversals of year-end bonus accruals related to a discontinued R D project
 should have been recorded as the forgiveness of a liability, and therefore a reduction in Other Income on the income statement, as
 opposed to a reduction to R D expense. 

51 

A material weakness is a
control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement
of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a company with limited accounting
resources, a significant amount of management s time and attention has been and will be diverted from our business to ensure compliance
with these regulatory requirements. 

Our management plans to establish
procedures to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed
to taking further action and implementing necessary enhancements or improvements. Management expects to complete an assessment of the
design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Remediation Plan 

Management continues to take
steps to develop and enhance its internal controls over financial reporting, and has implemented the following controls to remediate
the above material weakness: 

Implement an added layer of technical review by an internal financial reporting director for one
 time significant entries to ensure appropriate classification is assessed. 

Management will consider
the material weakness to be fully remediated once the controls have been operating effectively for sufficient contiguous reporting periods,
and after Management has validated the effective operation of the controls through testing. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
and Procedures 

In designing and evaluating
our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or
fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

52 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

From time to time, we may
be a party to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. The impact and outcome of litigation, if any, is subject
to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We
believe the ultimate resolution of any such current proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our continued financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. 

Such current litigation or
other legal proceedings are described in, and incorporated by reference in, this Item 1. Legal Proceedings of this
Form 10-Q from, Part I Item 1. Financial Statements in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
in Note 10 Commitments and Contingences , under the heading Legal Matters. The Company believes that the
resolution of currently pending matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations. However, assessment of the current litigation or other legal claims could change in light of the discovery
of facts not presently known to the Company or by judges, juries or other finders of fact, which are not in accord with management s
evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims. 

Additionally, the outcome
of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts
in excess of management s expectations, the Company s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period
could be materially adversely affected. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

There have been no material
changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Commission on March 25, 2024, under the heading Risk Factors , which risk
factors are incorporated by reference herein, except as discussed below, and investors should review the risks provided in the Form 10-K
and below, prior to making an investment in the Company. The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be
affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in the Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023, under Risk Factors and below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly,
cause the Company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future,
financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company s
business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. 

General Business and Funding Risks 

Future
sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline. 

Sales
of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in
the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common
stock. 

As
of the date of this Report, we had 22,891 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, with a weighted
average exercise price of 61.92 per share; (a) 15,132 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding public warrants
exercisable at an exercise price of 4,370.00 per share, (b) 6,748 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of certain
outstanding private placement warrants at an exercise price of 1,900.00 per share, (d) 6,579 shares of common stock issuable upon
the exercise of certain outstanding private placement warrants at an exercise price of 2,850.00 per share, (e) 4,049 shares of common
stock issuable upon exercise of certain outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock with an exercise price of 3.23 per share,
(f) 3,000,000 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock with an
exercise price of 1.68 per share, (g) 168 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants which expire on May 2, 2025, and
(h) 1,900,138 shares of common stock with an exercise price of 1.50 per share; and up to a maximum of 10,000,000 shares of common stock
issuable upon conversion of 1,000,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. 

53 

The
exercise of such outstanding options or warrants or the conversion of outstanding convertible securities will result in further dilution
of your investment. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public
perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no
relationship between such sales and the performance of our business. 

Our current cash balance
is only expected to be sufficient to fund our planned business operations until approximately December 2025. If additional capital is
not available, we may not be able to pursue our planned business operations, may be forced to change our planned business operations,
or may take other actions that could adversely impact our stockholders, including seeking bankruptcy protection. 

We are a clinical stage biotechnology
company that is transitioning into the iGaming industry which currently has no revenue. Thus, our business does not generate the cash
necessary to finance our planned business operations. We will require significant additional capital to: (i) protect our intellectual
property; (ii) attract and retain highly-qualified personnel; (iii) respond effectively to competitive pressures; and (iv) acquire
complementary businesses or technologies. 

Our future capital needs
depend on many factors, including: (i) the scope, duration and expenditures associated with our research, development and commercialization
efforts as they relate to iGaming; (ii) the outcome of potential partnering or licensing transactions, if any; (iii) competing
technological developments with regards to our iGaming platform; and (iv) protecting and supporting our proprietary patent positions. 

We will need to raise substantial
additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or strategic alliances and licensing arrangements to finance
our planned business operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. General market
conditions, rising interest rates and inflation, as well as global conflicts such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia,
and Israel and Hamas, may make it difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets, and the terms of any financing may adversely
affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, further
dilution to our stockholders will result, which may substantially dilute the value of their investment. Any equity financing may also
have the effect of reducing the conversion or exercise price of our outstanding convertible or exercisable securities, which could result
in the issuance (or potential issuance) of a significant number of additional shares of our common stock. In addition, as a condition
to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders.
Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility to conduct future business activities
and, in the event of insolvency, could be paid before holders of equity securities received any distribution of our assets. We may be
required to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses through alliance, joint venture or agreements
on terms that are not favorable to us, in order to raise additional funds. Our current cash balance is only expected to be sufficient
to fund our planned business operations until approximately December 2025. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to delay,
reduce or eliminate one or more of our planned activities with respect to our business, or terminate our operations, or may be forced
to seek bankruptcy protection. These actions would likely reduce the market price of our common stock. 

We will need additional
capital which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, which raises questions about our ability to continue
as a going concern. 

The Company has not generated
any revenues and has incurred significant losses since inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit
of 129,238,340 and a working capital deficit of 5,158,449, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a net loss of 1,894,683
and cash used in operating activities of 529,906. The Company expects to invest a significant amount of capital to commercialize its
iGaming assets and fund research and development. On September 29, 2024, the Company acquired certain source code and intellectual property
relating to an online blockchain casino and plans to build and launch a fully operational casino operation as part of its future
operations. The Company expects to invest a significant amount of capital to fund the development and operation of this business. As a
result, the Company expects that its operating expenses will increase significantly, and consequently will require significant revenues
to become profitable. Even if the Company does become profitable, it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly
or annual basis. The Company cannot predict when, if ever, it will be profitable. As of November 14, 2024, we had cash on hand of approximately
 2.7 million, which we expect will last us until December 2025. The Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared
assuming we will continue as a going concern. As we are not generating revenues, we need to raise a significant amount of capital in order
to pay our debts and cover our operating costs. While we have raised funds in the past through debt and the sale of equity, there is no
assurance that we will be able to raise additional needed capital or that such capital will be available under favorable terms. 

54 

We are subject to all the
substantial risks inherent in the development of a new business enterprise within an extremely competitive industry. Due to the absence
of a long-standing operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, we anticipate operating losses until
we can successfully implement our business strategy, which includes all associated revenue streams. We may never achieve profitable operations
or generate significant revenues. 

We currently have a monthly
cash requirement spend of approximately 200,000. We believe that in the aggregate, we will require significant additional capital funding
to support and expand our iGaming assets, the research and development and marketing of our products, fund future clinical trials, repay
debt obligations, provide capital expenditures for additional equipment and development costs, payment obligations, office space and
systems for managing the business, and cover other operating costs until our planned revenue streams from products are fully-implemented
and begin to offset our operating costs, if ever. 

Since our inception, we have
funded our operations with the proceeds from equity and debt financing. We have experienced liquidity issues due to, among other reasons,
our limited ability to raise adequate capital on acceptable terms. We have historically relied upon the sale of equity and debt funding
that is convertible into shares of our common stock to fund our operations and have devoted significant efforts to reduce that exposure.
We anticipate that we will need to issue equity to fund our operations and fund our operating expenses for the foreseeable future. If
we are unable to achieve operational profitability or we are not successful in securing other forms of financing, we will have to evaluate
alternative actions to reduce our operating expenses and conserve cash. 

These conditions raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
we be unable to continue as a going concern. The Consolidated Financial Statements included herein also include a going concern footnote. 

Additionally, wherever possible,
the Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash
consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock.
The Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, but subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations (which
generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20 of our then outstanding
shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20 of our then outstanding shares of stock, subject to certain exceptions),
to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common
stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future.
These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders, may further dilute common stock book value,
and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management s ability to maintain control of
us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management. 

Our accounts payable
are significant, and we do not currently have sufficient funds to pay such accounts payable, a large portion of which are past due. 

We do not currently have
adequate cash on hand, and do not expect to generate revenues, sufficient to pay down our significant accounts payable balance. A large
portion of our accounts payable balance represents amounts which are past due. While we are actively working with creditors to attempt
to satisfy amounts owed in shares of common stock, the issuance of which may cause dilution to existing stockholders, there can be no
assurance that such creditors will agree to accept equity in lieu of cash. Such creditors may in the future exercise remedies, including
suing the Company for nonpayment or attempting to force the Company into receivership. Creditor litigation may be costly and resource
intensive, which could deplete our already limited available cash and/or force us to raise additional funding, which may be dilutive
to existing stockholders or seek bankruptcy protection. In the event of a bankruptcy proceeding or insolvency, or restructuring of our
capital structure, holders of the Company s common stock could suffer a total loss of their investment. 

55 

We will need to raise
additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, causing dilution to our stockholders, restricting our operations
or adversely affecting our ability to operate our business. 

We may not be able to obtain
additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, including as a result of macroeconomic conditions such as a severe or prolonged
economic downturn. Disruption, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets could increase our cost of capital or limit our ability
to raise funds needed to operate our business. Disruptions could be caused by Federal Reserve policies and actions, currency concerns,
inflation, economic downturn or uncertainty, monetary policies, failures of financial institutions, U.S. debt management concerns, and
U.S. debt limit and budget disputes, including government shutdowns, European and worldwide sovereign debt concerns, other global or
geopolitical events, or other factors. Current macroeconomic conditions have negatively impacted the U.S. banking sector, including for
example, the recent closures and FDIC receiverships of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Although we do not have any accounts at
or business relationships with these banks, we may be negatively impacted by other disruptions to the U.S. banking system caused by these
or similar developments. 

We recently purchased
intellectual property and source code relating to the backend of an online casino; however, we have no experience operating in the gaming
industry and may not be successful in this endeavor. We also need to purchase or develop a front end for our online casino intellectual
property. 

As described in greater detail
above under Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business
Overview Planned iGaming Casino Operations Asset Purchase Agreement , on September 30, 2024, we completed the acquisition
of source code and intellectual property relating to the backend of an online blockchain casino. Neither we, nor our officers, have significant
experience in operating an online casino, provided that our current Chief Financial Officer previously served as Chief Financial Officer
of an online gaming company. We may not be able to retain, hire or train personnel as quickly or efficiently as we need or on terms that
are acceptable to us. An inability to efficiently operate our businesses would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
conditions, results of operations, and prospects. 

Additionally, before being
able to monetize the acquired assets we will need to either purchase or create a front end for the online casino and obtain required
permits and licenses. The purchase or creation of such front end may be more time consuming or expensive than we anticipate, and we may
never generate significant revenues from such assets or operations. Additionally, it may be difficult, costly or too time consuming to
obtain required licenses and permits, and as a result, we may never generate revenues through such acquisition. 

We depend on our key
personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees. 

Our future growth and success
depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. We are highly dependent on our current management, including
our Interim Chief Executive Officer, Blair Jordan and our Chief Financial Officer, Omar Jimenez. The inability to hire or retain experienced
management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. The competition
for qualified personnel is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development
of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.

Our industry and the
broader U.S. economy have experienced higher than expected inflationary pressures during 2022 and 2023, related to continued supply chain
disruptions, labor shortages and geopolitical instability. Should these conditions persist, our business, future results of operations
and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 

During 2022 and the early
part of 2023, there were significant increases in the costs of certain materials, products and shipping costs, as a result of availability
constraints, supply chain disruption, increased demand, labor shortages associated with a fully employed U.S. labor force, high inflation
and other factors. Supply and demand fundamentals have been further aggravated by disruptions in global energy supply caused by multiple
geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and Israel and Hamas, which threatens to spread to other
Middle Eastern countries. Service, materials and shipping costs have also increased accordingly with general supply chain and inflation
issues seen throughout the U.S. leading to increased operating costs. Supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures have in the
past and may in the future, adversely impact our operating costs and may negatively impact our future product costs, consulting costs
and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Our License Agreements
with the University of Oxford and other licensors may be terminated in certain circumstances without our consent. 

All of our License Agreements
with the University of Oxford and other licensors remain subject to various conditions and covenants, and provide for certain termination
rights to the licensors. Those agreements typically allow termination by the licensor for our failure to pay amounts due timely, our
failure to cure a material breach under the terms of the applicable license agreement, our insolvency, and certain changes in our operations,
including operating in areas or industries which Oxford deems outside of its guidelines, including the gambling industry. As a result,
if we are deemed insolvent, or in the event we seek bankruptcy protection, or we continue to operate in the gambling industry, the licensors
of our license agreements may terminate their license agreements with us. In the event such license agreements are terminated, we could
lose the right to develop all of our platforms and technologies, may lose any investments made towards developing such platforms and
technologies, and may be left without any intellectual property, product pathways, or development opportunities. Such terminations may
result in the value of our securities declining in value or becoming worthless, the need for us to change our business plan, and may
result in the Company seeking bankruptcy protection. 

We owe a significant
amount of money to the University of Oxford, which funds we do not have. The university may take action against us to enforce their rights
to payment in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our operations. 

Due to recent financial constraints,
the Company has been unable to timely pay amounts due to the University of Oxford Oxford ), the licensor of the
majority of the Company s licenses and patents and the Company s research partner. Oxford alleges that an aggregate of approximately
 1.3 million is owed from the Company and one of its subsidiaries to Oxford under the terms of licenses and agreements with Oxford and
related parties. The Company is currently in ongoing discussions with Oxford to reduce that amount and enter into a payment plan with
regards to the amounts owed; however, no definitive terms or extensions have been agreed to date. Oxford has also notified the Company
that it is not willing to discuss any new projects or arrangements until all outstanding invoices have been paid or a payment plan has
been agreed to; has engaged a law firm to seek the collection of the amounts owed, together with interest; and has threatened legal proceedings
against us. While we are hopeful that we can come to mutually agreeable terms regarding a settlement, payment plan, and/or extension,
with Oxford, we may not have sufficient funds to pay amounts due to Oxford in the near term, if at all, and Oxford may take action against
us, including filing legal proceedings against us seeking amounts due and interest, attempting to terminate their relationship with us,
and/or filing a wind-up petition against one of the Company s subsidiaries in the U.K. If Oxford were to take legal action against
us or terminate their relationship with us, we may be forced to scale back our business plan and/or seek bankruptcy protection. We may
be subject to litigation and damages for our failure to pay amounts due to Oxford, and may be forced to pay interest and penalties, which
funds we do not currently have. We plan to seek to raise funding in the future to support our operations, and to pay amounts due to Oxford,
through a combination of equity offerings, debt financing or other capital sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses and
other similar arrangements, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity or debt securities,
if accomplished, may result in dilution to our then stockholders. The Company believes that due to the Company s move into the
online gaming/casino industry, Oxford may face certain additional challenges and constraints in continuing its contractual relationship
with the Company due to potential Economic, Social and Governance restrictions imposed by Oxford. Such challenges and constrains may
result in Oxford terminating or otherwise exiting its contractual relationship with the Company, potentially with limited notice or recourse
by the Company, including terminating prior licenses, while seeking immediate repayment of amounts currently due.

We may not receive
any further amount under our pre-merger directors and officers insurance policy in connection with certain litigation matters. 

On June 29, 2022, AmTrust
International Underwriters DAC AmTrust ), which was the premerger directors and officers insurance
policy underwriter for KBL, filed a declaratory relief action against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
(the Declaratory Relief Action seeking declaration of AmTrust s obligations under the directors 
and officers insurance policy. In the Declaratory Relief Action, AmTrust is claiming that as a result of the merger, we are no
longer the insured under the subject insurance policy, notwithstanding the fact that the fees which we seek to recover from AmTrust relate
to matters occurring prior to the merger. The parties filed various answers and the Company filed counterclaims against AmTrust between
September 2022 and November 2022, when the Company filed a Motion for Summary Adjudication against both AmTrust and Freedom. The Motion
was fully briefed and a hearing was held on March 9, 2023. The standard to prevail on a Motion for Summary Adjudication in the Court
is high to prevail and requires a judge to find that there are no disputed issues of fact so that they can rule on the issues as a matter
of law. In this instance the judge found three major issues could be decided as a matter of law in the Company s favor and that
one issue, the Change in Control exclusion, requires further discovery. 

On April 21, 2023, the Court
issued an Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part the Company s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Specifically, the Court
granted summary adjudication in favor of the Company on the following issues: (a) that the Company is, in fact, an insured under
both the AmTrust and Freedom insurance policies; (b) that certain SEC subpoena related expenses for defendants Dr. Marlene Krauss,
the Company s former Chief Executive Officer and Director, and George Hornig, the former Chairman of the Board, are within the
basic scope of coverage under both the AmTrust and Freedom insurance policies; and (c) that the Insured vs. Insured exclusion relied
upon by AmTrust and Freedom is not applicable to bar any such coverage. 

The Court also found that
there were issues of disputed facts as to the Change in Control exclusion contained within the policies, which therefore precluded the
Court from granting the remainder of the Company s requests for summary adjudication as a matter of law. Accordingly, the Court,
at this time, denied the Company s further requests for summary adjudication and deemed that for the time being, the Change in
Control issue is to be determined at the time of trial, in order to find that the policies provide (i) coverage for the fees which
the Company has advanced and will advance to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig; (ii) that AmTrust has breached the policy; (iii) that
AmTrust must pay such expenses of the Company; and that, once the AmTrust policy has been exhausted, (iv) that Freedom will be obligated
to pay such expenses of the Company pursuant to its policy. 

On August 4, 2023, the Court
granted the Company s request to file a second motion for partial summary judgment in this case, this one being on the issue of
whether AmTrust should be required to advance to the Company the defense costs being incurred by Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig
during the pendency of the case. The Company filed such Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and it has now been fully briefed by the
parties. The hearing for such motion was held on January 11, 2024. After the matter was taken under submission, on February 12, 2024,
the Court granted the Company s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against both AmTrust and Freedom, and ordered as follows: (a) AmTrust
is obligated under its insurance policy with the Company to advance to the Company all defense costs in excess of the deductible that
the Company has advanced, or will advance, to Dr. Krauss and Mr. Hornig in connection with certain SEC Subpoenas, and (b) upon exhaustion
of the AmTrust insurance policy, Freedom is obligated to do the same pursuant to its excess liability insurance policy with the Company.
This Order applies throughout the interim of the case, but does not constitute a final judgment, and both the Company and the two insurers
retain their rights to contest all applicable issues at trial, which is scheduled for May 12, 2025. A final judgment following trial
could potentially confirm these obligations of the insurers or, alternatively, reverse and require the Company to repay all or portions
of such advance payments. There is no assurance at this time as to what the final judgment may entail. 

58 

On April 16, 2024, AmTrust
paid the Company 2.27 million in reimbursement of fees which the Company has advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig,
of which the Company received 1.5 million after the payment of attorney s fees. On May 9, 2024, AmTrust paid the Company
 300,140 in reimbursement of fees which the Company had advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig, of which the Company has
received 200,093 after the payment of attorney s fees. 

The Company, Freedom and
Amtrust held a mediation conference on August 21, 2024, during which, the Company agreed to the terms of a settlement with Freedom, pursuant
to which Freedom agreed to pay 125,000 to the Company, of which the Company received approximately 83,333 after the payment of legal
fees. 

Amtrust and the Company have
commenced written discovery proceedings against each other and anticipate that depositions will also occur. The Company intends to continue
to vigorously pursue this matter in order to establish the Company s entitlement to full and final payment by AmTrust of the subject
advancement expenses of the Company. While the Company continues to believe it has a strong case against AmTrust, there can be no assurance
that the Company will prevail in this action. The final outcome of the litigation is unknown at this time and such final outcome could
be materially adverse to the Company. 

If we make any acquisitions,
they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business. 

If we make acquisitions in
the future, funding permitting, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired
company s assets, personnel and operations with our own. We do not anticipate that any acquisitions or mergers we may enter into
in the future would result in a change of control of the Company. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be
willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful
in making an acquisition, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our
expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation,
the following: 

the difficulty of integrating acquired products, services
or operations; 

the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management
 and the management of acquired companies; 

difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; 

the potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of
 any integration of new management personnel; 

the potential inability or failure to achieve additional sales and enhance our customer
 base through cross-marketing of the products to new and existing customers; 

the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired; 

potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses or product lines, or
 the need to spend significant amounts to retool, reposition or modify the marketing and sales of acquired products or operations,
 or the defense of any litigation, whether or not successful, resulting from actions of the acquired company prior to our acquisition;
 and 

potential expenses under the labor, environmental and other laws of various jurisdictions. 

59 

Our business could be severely
impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection
with an acquisition, many of which cannot be presently identified. These risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract
our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. 

Claims, litigation,
government investigations, and other proceedings may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

We are currently subject
to, and expect to continue to be regularly subject to, actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings.
In addition, we have filed lawsuits against certain parties for matters we discovered which related to KBL, prior to the November 6,
2020, business combination. Any of these types of proceedings may have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of
our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently
unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves and possible losses from such matters involves judgment
and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be
exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change
or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations,
or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement,
could require us to make substantial future payments, prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to change our
business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products
or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations. 

Risks Relating to our Planned Online Casino
Operations 

We have no operating
history in the gaming industry and have incurred significant operating losses since inception. We may never become profitable or, if
achieved, be able to sustain profitability. 

We have no operating history
in the gaming industry upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that our gaming operations will prove successful, and we
may never achieve profitable operations. We currently expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Even if we do achieve profitability,
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to sustain profitability. As a result of the acquisition of certain blockchain casino
intellectual property, we plan to focus a portion of our attention on the online gaming industry, and we have limited experience in that
industry. If we are unsuccessful in operating our business, it will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

The online gaming industry
is highly competitive, and if the Company fails to compete effectively, it could experience price reductions,
reduced margins or loss of revenues. 

The online gaming industry
is highly competitive. A number of companies offer products and services that are similar to the Company s planned online casino.
The majority of the Company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial,
technical and marketing resources, greater name recognition, broader or more integrated product offerings, larger technical staffs and
a larger installed customer base. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in
customer requirements, develop superior products, and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of online gaming
operations than the Company can. 

Because of the rapid growth
of the gaming industry, and the relatively low capital barriers to entry in the software industry, the Company expects additional competition
from other established and emerging companies. Additionally, the Company s competitors could combine or merge to become more formidable
competitors or may adapt more quickly than we can to new technologies, evolving industry trends and changing customer requirements. 

60 

Competition within
the global entertainment and gaming industries is intense and the future offerings of the Company may not be
able to compete against other competing forms of entertainment such as television, movies and sporting events, as well as other entertainment
and gaming options on the Internet. If the Company s offerings are not popular, the Company s business
could be harmed. 

The Company plans to begin
operating in the global gaming industry. The users of the Company s planned online casino offering will face a vast array of entertainment
choices. Other forms of entertainment, such as television, movies, sporting events and in-person casinos, are more well established and
may be perceived by users to offer greater variety, affordability, interactivity and enjoyment. The Company s planned products
and services will compete with these other forms of entertainment for the discretionary time and income of end users. If we are unable
to sustain sufficient interest in the Company s planned products, services and offerings in comparison to other forms of entertainment,
including new forms of entertainment, the Company s business model may not be viable. 

The Company will
face the risk of fraud, theft, and cheating. 

The Company will face the
risk that third-parties, employees or consultants may attempt or commit fraud or theft or cheat using the Company s products. Such
risks include backdoors, nefarious code and other efforts. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in
losses in the Company s operations and those of the Company s future customers. Negative publicity related to such acts or
schemes could have an adverse effect on the Company s reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on the Company s
business. 

The Company will
rely on third party cloud services and such providers or services may encounter technical problems and service interruptions. 

The Company expects to
host its future services on a combination of proprietary and cloud servers. Such servers have in the past and may in the future experience
slower response times or interruptions as a result of increased traffic or other reasons. The Company will not have control over the
operations of the facilities or infrastructure of the third-party service providers that they use. Such third parties facilities
are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar
events or acts of misconduct. We expect that the continuing and uninterrupted performance of the Company s platform will be critical
to our success. The Company may experience, interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from these third-party service
providers from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting
disruptions and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in these third parties service levels may adversely affect our
ability to meet the requirements of the Company s users. Since our platform s continuing and uninterrupted performance is
expected to be critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may
become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as the Company expands, and
the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and may
adversely affect the usage of our offerings. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, reduce the availability
or usage of our platform, lead to a significant loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our ability to attract new customers,
any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Malfunctions of third-party
communications infrastructure, hardware and software may expose the Company to a variety of risks it cannot
control. 

The business
of the Company is expected to depend upon the capacity, reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties over which
the Company s offerings are deployed. The Company has no control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of a significant portion
of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment. The Company instead will depend
on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of their connections. If one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling
to supply or expand their levels of service in the future, the operations of the Company could be adversely impacted. Also, to the extent
the number of users of networks utilizing the Company s future products and services suddenly increases, the technology platform
and secure hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times or service
interruptions. System interruptions or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained
or repeated, could reduce the appeal of the networks to users. In addition, users depend on real-time communications; outages caused
by increased traffic could result in delays and system failures. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that the products
and services of the Company do not function properly and could therefore adversely affect the Company s ability to attract and
retain licensees, strategic partners, and customers. 

61 

The Company s
planned online casino is part of a new and evolving industry, which presents significant uncertainty and business risks. 

The gaming platforms, systems
and gaming content industries are relatively new and continue to evolve. Whether these industries grow and whether their business will
ultimately succeed, will be affected by, among other things, mobile platforms, legal and regulatory developments (such as passing new
laws or regulations or extending existing laws or regulations to online gaming and related activities), taxation of gaming activities,
data and information privacy and payment processing laws and regulations, and other factors that are unable to be predicted and which
are beyond the control of the Company. 

Given the dynamic evolution
of these industries, it can be difficult to plan strategically, including as it relates to product launches in new or existing jurisdictions
which may be delayed or denied, and it is possible that competitors will be more successful than the Company is at adapting to change
and pursuing business opportunities. Additionally, as the online gaming industry advances, including with respect to regulation in new
and existing jurisdictions, the Company may become subject to additional compliance-related costs, including regulatory infractions,
licensing, and taxes. If our product offerings do not obtain popularity or maintain popularity, or if we fail to grow in a manner that
meets our expectations, or if we cannot offer product offerings in particular jurisdictions that may be material to our business, then
our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 

Additionally, possible future
changes in governmental regulations pose material risks to the Company. These changes may include amendments to existing rules or the
introduction of new ones, shifts in regulatory focus or policy, or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of current rules and
policies. These could lead to increased compliance costs, restrictions or prohibitions on current operations, or required alterations
to the way the Company s then services are offered or marketed, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on the results
of operations and financial condition of the Company. 

Failure to comply with
regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction, or the failure to successfully obtain a license or permit applied for in a particular
jurisdiction, could impact the ability of the Company to comply with licensing and regulatory requirements in
other jurisdictions, or could cause the rejection of license applications or cancellation of existing licenses in other jurisdictions. 

Compliance with the various
regulations applicable to online gaming is costly and time-consuming. Regulatory authorities at the federal, state and local levels (both
in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions) have broad powers with respect to the regulation and licensing of real money online gaming
operations and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit the licenses of the Company, impose substantial fines on us, and take other actions,
any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We do
not currently hold any licenses and will need to obtain licenses in the future to operate our planned online blockchain casino. Such
licenses may not be available in the timeframe we expect, may be more costly, or may require us to undertake various resource intensive
actions to obtain. These laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various legislative
and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or regulations or enact new laws and regulations regarding these matters. The Company strives
to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to its business. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be
interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules. Non-compliance
with any such law or regulations could expose the Company to claims, proceedings, litigation and investigations by private parties and
regulatory authorities, as well as substantial fines and negative publicity, each of which may materially and adversely affect the business
of the Company. 

The future gaming licenses
of the Company could be revoked, suspended or conditioned at any time. The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss
of a license or affect our eligibility for such a license in another jurisdiction, and any of such losses, or potential for such loss,
could cause the Company to cease offering some or all of its offerings in the impacted jurisdictions. The Company may be unable to obtain
or maintain all necessary registrations, licenses, permits or approvals, and could incur fines or experience delays related to the licensing
process, which could adversely affect its operations. The delay or failure to obtain or maintain licenses by the Company in any jurisdiction
may prevent it from distributing its offerings, increasing its customer base and/or generating revenues. The Company may not be able
to obtain and maintain the licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct its operations. Any failure by the Company or its customers
to maintain or renew existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects of the Company. 

62 

The product offerings of
the Company must be approved in most regulated jurisdictions in which they are offered; this process cannot be assured or guaranteed. 

If the Company fails to obtain
necessary gaming licenses in a given jurisdiction, we would likely be prohibited from distributing and providing our product offerings
in that particular jurisdiction. If we fail to seek, do not receive, or receive a suspension or revocation of a license in a particular
jurisdiction for our product offerings (including any related technology and software) then we cannot offer the same in that jurisdiction
and our gaming licenses in other jurisdictions may be impacted. Furthermore, some jurisdictions require license holders to obtain government
approval before engaging in some transactions. We may not be able to obtain all necessary licenses in a timely manner, or at all. Delays
in regulatory approvals or failure to obtain such approvals may also serve as a barrier to entry to the market for our product offerings.
If the Company is unable to overcome the barriers to entry, it will materially affect our results of operations and future prospects. 

To the extent new online
gaming jurisdictions are established or expanded, the Company cannot guarantee it will be successful in penetrating such new jurisdictions
or expanding its business or customer base in line with the growth of existing jurisdictions. As the Company directly or indirectly enters
into new markets, it may encounter legal, regulatory and political challenges that are difficult or impossible to foresee and which could
result in an unforeseen adverse impact on planned revenues or costs associated with the new market opportunity. If the Company is unable
to effectively develop and operate directly or indirectly within these new markets or if its competitors are able to successfully penetrate
geographic markets that it cannot access or where it faces other restrictions, then the Company s business, operating results and
financial condition could be impaired. The failure of the Company to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals in jurisdictions,
whether individually or collectively, would have a material adverse effect on its business. 

Legislative and regulatory
changes could negatively affect the business of the Company and the business of its customers. 

Legislative and regulatory
changes may affect demand for or place limitations on the Company s future operations. Such changes could affect the Company in
a variety of ways. Legislation or regulation may introduce limitations on their products or opportunities for the use of our products
and could foster competitive products. Our business will likely also suffer if our products become obsolete due to changes in laws or
the regulatory framework. Moreover, legislation to prohibit, limit or add burdens to our business may be introduced in the future in
jurisdictions where gaming has been legalized. In addition, from time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed
legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions
in which we then operate and will operate in the future. 

Legislative or regulatory
changes negatively impacting the gaming industry as a whole could also decrease the demand for our future products. Opposition to gaming
could result in restrictions or even prohibitions of gaming operations in any jurisdiction or could result in increased taxes on gaming
revenues. Tax matters, including changes in state, federal or other tax legislation or assessments by tax authorities could have a negative
impact on our business. A reduction in growth of the gaming industry or in the number of gaming jurisdictions or delays in the opening
of new or expanded casinos could reduce demand for our products. Changes in current or future laws or regulations or future judicial
intervention in any particular jurisdiction may have a material adverse effect on our existing and proposed foreign and domestic operations.
Any such adverse change in the legislative or regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition. 

63 

The gaming industry
is highly regulated, and the Company must adhere to various regulations and maintain applicable licenses to operate. Failure
to abide by regulations or maintain applicable licenses could be disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our operations. 

The Company and its planned
products are, and will be, subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations of the
jurisdictions in which we do business and our planned products are used. Such entities currently block direct access to wagering on websites
from jurisdictions in which they do not have a license to operate through IP address filtering. Individuals are required to enter their
age upon gaining access to their platforms and any misrepresentation of such users age will result in the forfeiting of his or her deposit
and any withdrawals from such users account requires proof of government issued identification. In addition, payment service providers
use their own identify and internet service provider (ISP) verification software. Despite all such measures, it is conceivable that
a user, underage, or otherwise could devise a way to evade the Company s blocking measures and access its website from the United
States or any other foreign jurisdiction in which the Company is not then permitted to operate. 

Violations of laws in one
jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. Licenses, approvals or findings of suitability may be revoked,
suspended or conditioned. In sum, the Company may not be able to obtain or maintain all necessary registrations, licenses, permits or
approvals. The licensing process may result in delays or adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain key personnel, and
our efforts to comply with any new licensing regulations will increase our costs. 

A reduction in discretionary
consumer spending, from an economic downturn or disruption of financial markets or other factors, could negatively impact the financial
performance of the Company as it develops its iGaming business. 

Gaming and other leisure
activities that the Company plans to offer represent discretionary expenditures and players participation in those activities
may decline if discretionary consumer spending declines, including during economic downturns, when consumers generally earn less disposable
income. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences are driven by factors beyond the Company s control,
such as: 

perceived or actual general economic conditions; 

fears of recession and changes
 in consumer confidence in the economy; 

high energy, fuel and other commodity
 costs; 

the potential for bank failures
 or other financial crises; 

a soft job market; 

an actual or perceived decrease
 in disposable consumer income and wealth; 

increases in taxes, including
 gaming taxes or fees; and 

terrorist attacks or other global
 events. 

During periods of economic
contraction, the Company may not be able to generate expected or any revenues, while most of the Company s costs remain fixed and
some costs even increase, resulting in decreased earnings. 

The Company will face
cyber security risks that could result in damage to the Company s reputation and/or subject them to fines, payment of damages,
lawsuits and restrictions on the Company s use of data. 

The information systems
and data of the Company, including those the Company maintains with the Company s third-party service providers, may be subject
to cyber security breaches in the future. Computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the Company s network security
and misappropriate, copy or pirate the Company s confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or
cause interruptions or shutdowns of the Company s internal systems and services. The Company s websites may become subject
to denial-of-service attacks, where a website is bombarded with information requests eventually causing the website to overload, resulting
in a delay or disruption of service. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other
malicious software programs that attack the Company s products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of the Company s
products. Also, there is a growing trend of advanced persistent threats being launched by organized and coordinated groups against corporate
networks to breach security for malicious purposes. 

64 

The techniques used to obtain
unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to the Company s systems, the Company s data or customers data, disable
or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, may be difficult
to detect quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched. Although the Company has developed,
and plans to develop, systems and processes designed to protect the Company s data and customer data and to prevent data loss and
other security breaches and expects to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, there can be no assurance
that these security measures will provide absolute security. 

Disruptions in the availability
of their computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could damage our computer or telecommunications systems, impact our ability
to service our customers, adversely affect our operations and results of operations, and have an adverse effect on our reputation. The
costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could
be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of future
customers and may impede our sales, distribution and other critical functions. We may also be subject to regulatory penalties and litigation
by customers and other parties whose information has been compromised, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and cash flows. 

Risks Relating to our Common Stock and other
Securities 

We currently have
an illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, and the market for our common stock is and may remain illiquid and volatile in
the future. 

We currently have a highly
sporadic, illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, which market is anticipated to remain sporadic, illiquid and volatile in
the future. During the last 52 weeks our common stock has traded as high as 17.75 per share and as low as 1.16 per share. The market
price of our common stock may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Our financial performance, government
regulatory action, tax laws, interest rates, and market conditions in general could have a significant impact on the future market price
of our common stock.

Our common stock is listed
on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ATNF. Our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated
or disproportionate to our operating performance. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been
unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price
of our common stock. Additionally, general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, inflation, war, interest rates
or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Due to the limited volume of our shares
which trade, we believe that our stock prices (bid, ask and closing prices) may not be related to our actual value, and not reflect
the actual value of our common stock. You should exercise caution before making an investment in us. 

Stock markets in general
and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate
to the operating performance of those companies and our company. For example, during 2022, the closing sales prices of our common stock
ranged from a post-split adjusted high of 1,482.04 per share to a low of 23.56 per share, during fiscal 2023, the closing sales prices
of our common stock ranged from a high of 100.70 per share to a low of 3.21 per share and during fiscal 2024 (through the date of this
Report), the closing sales prices of our common stock ranged from a post-split adjusted high of 6.47 per share to a low of 1.18 per
share. During this time, we do not believe that we have experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations
that would explain such price volatility or trading volume; however, we have sold equity which was dilutive to existing stockholders.
These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our securities. Additionally, these and other external factors
have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or
prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our
common stock. 

Additionally, as a result
of the illiquidity of our common stock, investors may not be interested in owning our common stock because of the inability to acquire
or sell a substantial block of our common stock at one time. Such illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our
common stock. In addition, a shareholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common stock as collateral because lenders may be
unwilling to accept the pledge of securities having such a limited market. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop
or, if one develops, may not be sustained. 

In the past, many companies
that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be
the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our
management s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. 

Information available
in public media that is published by third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media may include
statements not attributable to us and may not be reliable or accurate. 

We are aware of a large volume
of information being disseminated by third parties relating to our operations, including in blogs, message boards and social and other
media. Such information as reported by third parties may not be accurate, may lead to significant volatility in our securities and may
ultimately result in our common stock or other securities declining in value. 

The exercise of our
outstanding options and warrants, and the sale of common stock upon exercise thereof, may adversely affect the trading price of our securities. 

As of the date of this Report,
we had 22,891 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, with a weighted average exercise price
of 61.92 per share; (a) 15,132 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding public warrants exercisable at
an exercise price of 4,370.00 per share, (b) 6,748 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of certain outstanding private
placement warrants at an exercise price of 1,900.00 per share, (d) 6,579 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of certain
outstanding private placement warrants at an exercise price of 2,850.00 per share, (e) 4,049 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise
of certain outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock with an exercise price of 3.23 per share, (f) 3,000,000 shares
of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of 1.68 per
share, (g) 168 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants which expire on May 2, 2025, and (h) 1,900,138 shares of common
stock issuable upon exercise of warrants to purchase 1,900,138 shares of common stock with an exercise price of 1.50 per share. For
the life of the options and warrants, the holders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock
without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding securities will also dilute the ownership
interests of our existing stockholders. 

67 

The availability of these
shares for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or conversion
of other securities, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price
of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an
acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 

In addition, the common stock
issuable upon exercise/conversion of outstanding convertible securities may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market
price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company s stock in the market than there is demand
for that stock. When this happens the price of our stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell
in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb shares sold by holders
of our outstanding convertible securities, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease. 

Our outstanding public
warrants are significantly out of the money. 

Each Public Warrant entitles
the holder to purchase one-seven hundred sixtieth of one share of common stock at an exercise price of 5.75 per 1/760 th of
one share 4,370.00 per whole share), subject to adjustment. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants.
The Public Warrants became exercisable 12 months from the closing of the IPO and expire five years after the completion of the Business
Combination (November 6, 2025). The Public Warrants are significantly out of the money and because no fractional shares will be issued
upon exercise of the Public Warrants, the Public Warrants are only exercisable in multiples of 760. As a result, the Public Warrants
may not have any significant value. Additionally, warrant holders not holding at least 760 Public Warrants or who hold Public Warrants
which would be exercisable for a fractional share of common stock, must sell any warrants to obtain value from the fractional interest.
As a result, the trading of the Public Warrants may be limited or sporadic, and such Public Warrants may not have any significant value.
Any holder of Public Warrants holding less than 760 Public Warrants or a number of Public Warrants not evenly divisible by 760 will not
receive any common stock upon the exercise of Public Warrants, as no fractional shares of common stock are issuable upon exercise thereof. 

Provisions of certain
outstanding warrants could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party. 

Provisions of certain outstanding
warrants could make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. Certain outstanding warrants prohibit us from engaging
in certain transactions constituting fundamental transactions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes
our obligations under each of the outstanding warrants to purchase up to 17,376 shares of common stock with an exercise price of 3.23
per share (warrants to purchase 4,049 shares of common stock), 1,900 per share (warrants to purchase 6,748 shares of common stock) and
 2,850 per share (warrants to purchase 6,579 shares of common stock). Further, such outstanding warrants provide that, in the event of
certain transactions constituting fundamental transactions, with some exception, holders of such warrants will have the
right, at their option, to require us to repurchase such warrants at a price described in the applicable warrants (based on the Black
Scholes Value of such warrants). These and other provisions of the warrants could prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us even
where the acquisition could be beneficial to stockholders. 

A significant number
of our shares are eligible for sale and their sale or potential sale may depress the market price of our common stock and cause significant
dilution to existing stockholders. 

Sales of a significant number
of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. Most of our common stock is available
for immediate resale in the public market, including (i) outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 22,891 shares of
common stock at a weighted average exercise price of 61.92 per share; and (ii) outstanding warrants to purchase 48,302 shares of
common stock at exercises prices from between 3.23 and 4,370 per share. If a significant number of shares were sold, such sales would
increase the supply of our common stock, thereby potentially causing a decrease in its price. Some or all of our shares of common stock
may be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to effective registration statements and/or compliance with Rule 144,
which sales could have a depressive effect on the market for our shares of common stock. Subject to certain restrictions, a person who
has held restricted shares for a period of six months may generally sell common stock into the market. The sale of a significant portion
of such shares when such shares are eligible for public sale may cause the value of our common stock to decline in value. 

68 

There may not be sufficient
liquidity in the market for our securities in order for investors to sell their shares. The market price of our common stock may continue
to be volatile. 

The market price of our common
stock will likely continue to be highly volatile. Some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our common stock
are beyond our control, such as conditions or trends in the industry in which we operate or sales of our common stock. This situation
is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts,
stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even
if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as
ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. 

As a consequence, there may
be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a mature issuer which
has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price.
It is possible that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will not develop or be sustained, or that trading
levels will not continue. These factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our performance.
In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has significantly
affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific
companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

We are not in compliance
with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq and are subject to a one year mandatory panel monitor, and as a result our common stock
and Public Warrants may be delisted from Nasdaq. 

Our common stock and Public
Warrants trade on Nasdaq under the symbols ATNF and ATNFW, respectively. Notwithstanding such listing,
there can be no assurance any broker will be interested in trading our securities. Therefore, it may be difficult to sell our securities
publicly. There is also no guarantee that we will be able to maintain our listings on Nasdaq for any period of time by perpetually satisfying
Nasdaq s continued listing requirements. 

We have previously been out
of compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements due to our failure to maintain a minimum bid price of at least 1.00
per share for our common stock, which failure was remedied in March 2024. 

Also, on October 11, 2023,
the Company received written notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the shareholder approval requirements
set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), which require prior shareholder approval for transactions, other than public offerings, involving
the issuance of 20 or more of the pre-transaction shares outstanding at less than the applicable Minimum Price (as defined in Listing
Rule 5635(d)(1)(A)), which non-compliance we remedied in December 2023. 

Additionally, on November
15, 2023, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum stockholders 
equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Equity Rule requires
companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders equity of at least 2,500,000. In the Company s Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported a stockholders deficit of 149,327), which
is below the minimum stockholders equity required for continued listing pursuant to the Equity Rule. Additionally, the Company
does not meet the alternative Nasdaq continued listing standards under Nasdaq Listing Rules and did not meet the minimum stockholders 
equity requirement as of December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 or June 30, 2024. 

69 

Nasdaq provided the Company
until January 2, 2024 to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance. We submitted the plan to regain compliance in a timely manner,
and on January 11, 2024, Nasdaq advised the Company that it has determined to grant the Company an extension to regain compliance with
the Equity Rule. 

The terms of the extension
were as follows: on or before May 13, 2024, the Company must have completed certain transactions described in greater detail in the compliance
plan, contemplated to result in the Company increasing its stockholders equity to more than 2.5 million, and opt for one of the
two following alternatives to evidence compliance with the Equity Rule: Alternative 1: The Company must have furnished to the SEC and
Nasdaq a publicly available report (e.g., a Form 8-K) including: 1. A disclosure of the Staff s deficiency letter and the
specific deficiency(ies) cited; 2. A description of the completed transaction or event that enabled the Company to satisfy the stockholders 
equity requirement for continued listing; and 3. An affirmative statement that, as of the date of the report, the Company believed it
had regained compliance with the stockholders equity requirement based upon the specific transaction or event referenced in Step
2; or Alternative 2: The Company must furnish to the SEC and Nasdaq a publicly available report including: 1. Steps 1 2 set forth
above; 2. A balance sheet no older than 60 days with pro forma adjustments for any significant transactions or event occurring on or
before the report date; and 3. That the Company believes it satisfies the stockholders equity requirement as of the report date.
The pro forma balance sheet must have evidenced compliance with the stockholders equity requirement. 

Additionally, in either case
the Company was required to disclose that Nasdaq will continue to monitor the Company s ongoing compliance with the stockholders 
equity requirement and, if at the time of its next periodic report the Company does not evidence compliance, that it may be subject to
delisting. 

While the Company was able
to undertake some of the transactions described in the compliance plan, it was unable to regain compliance with the Equity Rule prior
to the end of the plan period (May 13, 2024). As a result, on May 14, 2024, the Company received a delist determination letter from the
Listing Qualifications department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the Staff advising the Company that the
Staff had determined that the Company did not meet the terms of the extension. Specifically, the Company did not complete its proposed
transactions and was unable to file a Current Report Form 8-K by the May 13, 2024 deadline previously required by the Staff, evidencing
compliance with the Equity Rule. On May 17, 2024, the Company requested an appeal of the Staff s delisting determination, and on
May 20, 2024, the Staff advised the Company that the delisting action referenced in the Staff s determination letter had been stayed,
pending a final written decision by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel Panel ). On July 2, 2024, the Company received notice
that the Panel had determined to grant the Company s request to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to the
Company meeting certain conditions, including filing on or before July 31, 2024, a public disclosure describing the transactions undertaken
by the Company to achieve compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing rules and demonstrate long-term compliance with the Equity
Rule and providing an indication of its equity following those transactions. On July 22, 2024, the Panel granted the Company s
request for additional time to achieve compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing rules and demonstrate long-term compliance with
the Equity Rule. Specifically, the Hearings Panel subsequently extended that deadline to September 30, 2024, and further to October 15,
2024, to regain compliance with the Equity Rule and to allow the continued listing of the Company s common stock and warrants on
The Nasdaq Stock Market through such date, subject to the Company s compliance with the Equity Rule on or prior to such date. 

As a result of the acquisition
of the Purchased Assets (discussed below), issuance of the 1,000,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and Purchase Warrants
as described below, on October 4, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq confirming that we had regained compliance with the Equity Rule.
Nasdaq also advised the Company that in application of Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), the Company will be subject to a mandatory panel monitor
for a period of one year from the date of such letter. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the Staff finds that the Company is
no longer in compliance with the Equity Rule, then, notwithstanding Rule 5810(c)(2), the Company will not be permitted to provide Staff
with a plan of compliance with respect to such deficiency and the Staff will not be permitted to grant additional time for the Company
to regain compliance with respect to such deficiency, nor will the Company be afforded an applicable cure or compliance period pursuant
to Rule 5810(c)(3). Instead, the Staff will issue a Delist Determination Letter and the Company will have an opportunity to request a
new hearing with the initial Panel or a newly convened Hearings Panel if the initial Panel is unavailable. The Company will have the
opportunity to respond/present to the Hearings Panel as provided by Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(C) and the Company s securities may
at that time be delisted from Nasdaq. 

70 

If the Company s common
stock and public warrants are delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company s common stock and public warrants
or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company s common stock and public warrants could suffer a material decline.
Delisting could also impair the Company s ability to raise capital and/or trigger defaults and penalties under outstanding agreements
or securities of the Company. 

Separately, on May 14, 2024,
the Staff provided us notice of our non-compliance with the audit committee requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq set forth in
Listing Rule 5605(c)(2), which requires that listed companies maintain an audit committee of at least three independent directors. Nasdaq
provided the Company a cure period in order to regain compliance as follows: until the earlier of the Company s next annual shareholders 
meeting or May 7, 2025; or if the next annual shareholders meeting is held before November 4, 2024, then the Company must evidence
compliance no later than November 4, 2024. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by the applicable date above, Nasdaq rules
require the Staff to provide written notification to the Company that its securities will be delisted. At that time, the Company may
appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel. The Company is currently seeking out qualified independent directors to serve
on the Company s audit committee and expects to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5605(c)(2) in the near future. 

Among the conditions required
for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, Nasdaq requires us to maintain at least 2.5 million in stockholders equity
or 500,000 in net income over the prior two years or two of the prior three years. As of September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March
31, 2024, and June 30, 2024, our stockholders equity was below 2.5 million and we did not otherwise meet the net income requirements
described above, and as such, we were not in compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing standards relating to minimum stockholders 
equity until September 30, 2024. 

Our failure to meet Nasdaq s
continued listing requirements for the reasons above, or any other reason, may result in our securities being delisted from Nasdaq. 

Additional conditions required
for continued listing on Nasdaq include requiring that we have a majority of independent directors, a two-person compensation committee
and a three-member audit committee (each consisting of all independent directors), which three-person audit committee requirement we
do not currently meet. As a result, our common stock and Public Warrants may be delisted from Nasdaq. 

Even if we demonstrate compliance
with the requirements of Nasdaq, we will have to continue to meet other objective and subjective listing requirements to continue to
be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market could make trading our common stock and Public Warrants
more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a Nasdaq Capital Market listing,
stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our common stock and Public Warrants, the sale or
purchase of our common stock and Public Warrants would likely be made more difficult, and the trading volume and liquidity of our common
stock and Public Warrants could decline. Delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market could also result in negative publicity and could also
make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common
stock as currency or the value accorded by other parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state
blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common
stock and Public Warrants and the ability of our stockholders and warrant holders to sell our common stock and Public Warrants in the
secondary market. If our common stock and Public Warrants are delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock and Public Warrants may be eligible
to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB Market or the OTC Pink market, where an investor may find it more
difficult to sell our common stock and Public Warrants or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock and Public
Warrants. In the event our common stock and Public Warrants are delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, we may not be able to list our
common stock on another national securities exchange or obtain quotation on an over-the counter quotation system. 

71 

Stockholders may be
diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of additional shares of our
common stock. 

Wherever possible, our Board
will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will
consist of restricted shares of our common stock or where shares are to be issued to our officers, directors and applicable consultants.
Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, but subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations (which
generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20 of our then outstanding
shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20 of our then outstanding shares of stock, subject to certain exceptions),
to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares
of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders,
which may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing
management s ability to maintain control of the Company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting
existing management. 

Our Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock includes a liquidation preference. 

Our Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock includes a liquidation preference of 17.30 per share or 17,300,000 in aggregate, which is payable upon liquidation,
before any distribution to our common stock shareholders. As a result, if we were to dissolve, liquidate or wind up our operations, the
holders of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock would have the right to receive up to the first 17,300,000 in proceeds from any
such transaction, and we do not currently have 17.3 million in total net assets. The payment of the liquidation preferences could result
in common stock shareholders not receiving any consideration if we were to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, either voluntarily or involuntarily.
Additionally, the existence of the liquidation preferences may reduce the value of our common stock, make it harder for us to sell shares
of common stock in offerings, or prevent or delay a change of control. Because our Board of Directors is entitled to designate the powers
and preferences of the preferred stock without a vote of our shareholders, subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations, our shareholders
will have no control over what designations and preferences our future preferred stock, if any, will have. 

The Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock includes anti-dilution protection through the date of Stockholder Approval. 

The conversion rate of the
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, currently 0.685 per share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or 685,000 shares of common stock
in aggregate, which totals 40 of the Company s post-issuance common stock, is adjustable through the date of Stockholder Approval,
and is fixed at the time of Stockholder Approval, such that on the Stockholder Approval Date the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
will be convertible into 40 of the Company s post-issuance outstanding common stock. As a result, the total shares of common stock
issuable upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. Additionally,
the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will be issued an increased number of shares of common stock of the Company if
the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company increase prior to Stockholder Approval. As a result, if the Company issues any
equity compensation, sells any shares in any other offerings, or otherwise issues any shares of common stock prior to the Stockholder
Approval Date, the holder(s) of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will receive additional shares of common stock (compared
to the number of shares of common stock due as of the date of this Report), so that they will retain their 40 post-issuance ownership
of the Company as of the Stockholder Approval Date. Such additional issuances will in turn cause significant dilution to the stockholders
of the Company. Notwithstanding the above, the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock is 10 million shares of common stock, the total percentage of outstanding common stock which the Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock will be convertible into will be fixed at 40 at the time of Stockholder Approval, and no conversion of the Convertible
Preferred Stock can occur prior to Stockholder Approval. 

72 

The issuance of common
stock upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and upon exercise of warrants will cause immediate and substantial
dilution to existing shareholders. 

Following Stockholder Approval,
each holder of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may, at its option, convert its shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock into
a number of shares of common stock as equals 40 of the Company s post-issuance common stock at the time of Stockholder Approval,
divided by the 1,000,000 outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The issuance of common stock upon conversion of
the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders. 

The availability of shares
of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these
shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock
upon the conversion of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and/or upon exercise of outstanding warrants, or the effect, if any,
that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions
of substantial amounts of our common stock upon the conversion of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and upon exercise of warrants,
or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 

In addition, the common stock
issuable upon the conversion of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and upon exercise of warrants may represent overhang that may
also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company s stock
in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of our stock will decrease, and any additional shares
which stockholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common stock
cannot absorb shares sold by holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants, then the value of our common stock will
likely decrease. 

Additionally, the warrants
to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock which we granted effective September 30, 2024, which have an exercise price of 1.68 per
share and a term of seven years, which aren t exercisable until or unless Stockholder Approval is received, have cashless exercise
rights, which means that such warrants can be exercised without paying us any cash and instead with the holder netting the value of the
exercise price against the value of the shares issuable upon exercise thereof. Additionally, any shares of common stock issuable upon
the cashless exercise of such warrants will likely be able to tack the holding period of such shares of common stock with the warrants. 

The influx of any of these
shares into the public market could potentially have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. 

The Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock includes certain protective provisions and after Stockholder Approval, the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will
vote 40 of our then common stock. 

Until such time, if ever,
as Stockholder Approval is received, the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock only has rights to vote on amendments to the Series B Designation
(which are subject to the approval of a simple majority of the holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock), and the Protective Provisions,
discussed below. 

The Series B Preferred Stock
requires the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
to (a) increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total number of authorized shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock of the Company; (b) adopt or authorize any new designation of any Preferred Stock or amend the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Company in a manner which (i) provides any holder of common stock or preferred stock any rights upon a liquidation of the
Company which are prior and superior to those of the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; or (ii) adversely affect
the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; (c) effect an exchange, or create a right of
exchange, cancel, or create a right to cancel, of all or any part of the shares of another class of shares into shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock; (d) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
so as to affect adversely the shares of such series; and (e) issue any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock (collectively, the Protective Provisions ). 

73 

After Stockholder Approval,
in addition to the above voting rights, each holder of outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
cast the number of votes in connection with the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shares held by such holder equal to the number of
whole shares of common stock into which the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. At the time of Stockholder Approval such voting rights
will total 40 of the total vote of the common stock, subject to a maximum of 10 million shares of common stock being issuable upon conversion
of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, and will thereafter decrease if additional shares of common stock of the Company are issued.
Except as provided by law or by the other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Series B Designation, holders of Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of common stock as a single class and there shall be no series voting. 

As a result, following Stockholder
Approval, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will have significant influence on the stockholder vote. Consequently,
they will have the ability to influence matters affecting our stockholders and therefore exercise significant control in determining
the outcome of a number of corporate transactions or other matters, including (i) making amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation;
(ii) election of directors; and (iii) any merger or significant corporate transactions. As a potential investor in the Company,
you should keep in mind that even if you own shares of our common stock and wish to vote them at annual or special shareholder meetings,
your shares will have little effect on the outcome of corporate decisions immediately following Stockholder Approval. The interests of
the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other shareholders. 

In addition, this concentration
of ownership might adversely affect the market price of our common stock by: (1) delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control
of our Company; (2) impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our Company; or (3) discouraging
a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company.
