AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

AEP Consolidated Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders 
 
 Third Quarter of 2024 Compared to Third Quarter of 2023 
 
 Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders remained consistent, slightly increasing from 954 million in 2023 to 960 million in 2024. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders increased from 1,872 million in 2023 to 2,303 million in 2024 primarily due to: 
 
 A favorable impact from the receipt of PLRs in 2024 related to the treatment of NOLCs in retail rate making. See NOLCs in Retail Jurisdictions - IRS PLRs section below for additional information. 
 Favorable rate proceedings in AEP s various jurisdictions. 
 An increase in sales volumes driven by favorable weather and increased load in the commercial customer class. 
 Investment in transmission assets, which resulted in higher revenues and income. 
 A loss on the sale of the competitive contracted renewables portfolio in 2023. 
 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 
 A revenue refund provision related to SWEPCo s 2012 Texas Base Rate Case and the Turk Plant. 
 An increase in operating expenses due to the Federal EPA s revised CCR rule finalized in May 2024. 
 A severance accrual resulting from the voluntary severance program announced in April 2024. 
 
 See Results of Operations section for additional information by operating segment.

Customer Demand 
 
 AEP uses sales volumes by customer class as a way to measure significant drivers of customer demand. The percentage change in sales volumes by customer class are shown in the table below: 

(a) Percentage change for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (b) Percentage change for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (c) The increase in commercial sales was primarily due to new data processor loads and economic development. 
 
 2024 SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS 
 
 CCR Rule Revisions 
 
 In April 2024, the Federal EPA finalized revisions to the CCR Rule to expand the scope of the rule to include inactive impoundments at inactive facilities as well as to establish requirements for currently exempt solid waste management units that involve the direct placement of CCR on the land. In the second quarter of 2024, AEP evaluated the applicability of the rule to current and former plant sites and recorded a 674 million increase in ARO. See CCR Rule section in Environmental Issues below for additional information. 
 
 Voluntary Severance Program 
 
 In April 2024, management announced a voluntary severance program designed to achieve a reduction in the size of AEP s workforce. Approximately 7,400 of AEP s 16,800 employees were eligible to participate in the program. Approximately 1,000 employees chose to take the voluntary severance package and substantially all terminated employment in July 2024. The severance program provides two weeks of base pay for every year of service with a minimum of four weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks of base pay. Certain positions impacted by the voluntary severance program have been and will continue to be refilled to maintain safe, effective and efficient operations. Net savings from the program will help offset increasing operating expenses and high interest costs in order to keep electricity costs affordable for customers. AEP recorded a 122 million pretax expense in the second quarter of 2024 related to this voluntary severance program. The Registrants paid 111 million of the severance benefits in the third quarter of 2024. See Note 13 - Voluntary Severance Program for additional information.

NOLCs in Retail Jurisdictions - IRS PLRs 
 
 The Registrants have made rate filings with state commissions to transition to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in retail rate making. The Registrants completed the transition in Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia prior to 2024 and in Michigan in July 2024. In the most recent KPCo, I M (Indiana jurisdiction), PSO and SWEPCo base rate cases, the companies filed to transition to stand-alone rate making which was contingent upon a supportive PLR from the IRS. 
 
 In April 2024, supportive PLRs for certain retail jurisdictions were received from the IRS, effective March 2024. The PLRs concluded NOLCs on a stand-alone rate making basis should be included in rate base and should also be included in the computation of Excess ADIT regulatory liabilities to be refunded to customers. Based on this conclusion, I M, PSO and SWEPCo recognized regulatory assets related to revenue requirement amounts to be collected from customers, reduced Excess ADIT regulatory liabilities and recorded favorable impacts to net income in the first quarter of 2024 as shown in the table below: 
 
 Company Increase in Pretax Income from the Recognition of Regulatory Assets Reduction in Income Tax Expense (a) Increase in Net Income (in millions) I M 20.2 49.5 69.7 PSO 12.1 44.7 56.8 SWEPCo 35.4 101.1 136.5 AEP Total 67.7 195.3 263.0 
 
 (a) Primarily relates to a 224 million remeasurement of Excess ADIT Regulatory Liabilities partially offset by 29 million of tax expense on favorable pretax income from the recognition of regulatory assets. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2024, requests seeking to establish a recovery mechanism for these regulatory assets were filed in Indiana, Oklahoma and Texas. In Indiana and Oklahoma, certain intervenors have challenged the recovery, or have proposed ratemaking treatment that would offset the recovery, of the regulatory assets. In the third quarter of 2024, PUCT Staff and certain intervenors in Texas requested a hearing and direct testimony was filed by SWEPCo in October 2024. 
 
 Disposition of AEP OnSite Partners 
 
 In April 2023, AEP initiated a sales process for its ownership in AEP OnSite Partners. AEP OnSite Partners targets opportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other energy solutions. In May 2024, AEP signed an agreement to sell AEP OnSite Partners to a nonaffiliated third-party. In September 2024, AEP completed the sale to a nonaffiliated third-party and received cash proceeds of approximately 318 million, net of taxes and transaction costs. The proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt. See the Disposition of AEP OnSite Partners section of Note 6 for additional information. 
 
 Federal Tax Legislation 
 
 In August 2022, President Biden signed H.R. 5376 into law, commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA. Most notably this budget reconciliation legislation created a 15 minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income (CAMT), extended and increased the value of PTCs and ITCs, added a nuclear and clean hydrogen PTC, an energy storage ITC and allowed the sale or transfer of tax credits to third-parties for cash. As further significant guidance from Treasury and the IRS is expected on the tax provisions in the IRA, AEP will continue to monitor any issued guidance and evaluate the impact on future net income, cash flows and financial condition. 
 
 In September 2024, Treasury and the IRS issued proposed regulations on the application of CAMT. AEP and subsidiaries are subject to the CAMT and are expected to incur a liability in 2024. However, any CAMT cash taxes incurred are expected to be partially offset by regulatory recovery, the utilization of tax credits and additionally the cash inflow generated by the sale of tax credits. The sale of tax credits are presented in the operating section of the statements of cash flows consistent with the presentation of cash taxes paid. AEP presents the loss on sale of tax credits through income tax expense. 
 
 In April 2024, the IRS issued final regulations related to the transfer of tax credits. In 2023, AEP, on behalf of PSO, SWEPCo and AEP Energy Supply LLC, entered into transferability agreements with nonaffiliated parties to sell 2023 generated PTCs resulting in cash proceeds of approximately 174 million with 102 million received in 2023, 62 million 
 3 

received in the first quarter of 2024 and the remaining 10 million was received in the second quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, AEP, on behalf of PSO, SWEPCo and APCo, entered into transferability agreements with nonaffiliated parties to sell 2024 generated PTCs which will result in approximately 137 million of cash proceeds, of which approximately 91 million was received in the third quarter of 2024 and the remaining 46 million is expected to be received in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. AEP expects to continue to explore the ability to efficiently monetize its tax credits through third-party transferability agreements. 
 
 I M s Cook Plant qualifies for the transferable Nuclear PTC, which is available for tax years beginning in 2024 through 2032. The Nuclear PTC is calculated based on electricity generated and sold to third-parties and is subject to a reduction amount as the facility s gross receipts increase above a certain threshold. In the third quarter of 2024, AEP and I M have included 64 million of estimated Nuclear PTCs within their annualized ETR. Absent specific IRS guidance, AEP and I M s estimated 2024 Nuclear PTC was calculated using estimated 2024 gross receipts and forecasted annual generation for the Cook Plant. If, and when, IRS guidance is eventually issued, the value of the estimated Nuclear PTC will be updated to reflect such guidance, if necessary. See Note 11 - Income Taxes for additional information. 
 
 New Generation to Support Reliability 
 
 The growth of AEP s regulated generation portfolio reflects the company s commitment to meet customer s energy and capacity needs while balancing cost and reliability. 
 
 Significant Approved Generation Filings 
 
 AEP has received regulatory approvals from various state regulatory commissions to acquire approximately 2,505 MWs of owned renewable generation facilities, totaling approximately 6 billion. The estimated cost of these facilities are included in the Budgeted Capital Expenditures disclosure included in the Financial Condition section below. In addition, AEP has received regulatory approvals for 792 MWs of renewable purchase power agreements. The following table summarizes regulatory approvals received for active renewable projects as of September 30, 2024:

 (c) Includes approvals by the APSC and LPSC for 799 MWs of owned wind projects which have commenced construction. Additionally, the LPSC approved the flex-up option, allowing SWEPCo to provide additional services to Louisiana customers and recover the portion of the projects denied by the PUCT. 
 
 In June 2024, PSO entered into a PSA to acquire a 795 MW combined-cycle power generation facility located in Oklahoma. The acquisition is subject to OCC pre-approval including the approval of a rider to allow asset recovery prior to the inclusion in base rates in a future rate case. The acquisition also requires FERC approval and clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Subject to these approvals, PSO expects to close on the transaction by June 30, 2025.

Regulatory Matters - Utility Rates and Rate Proceedings 
 
 The Registrants are involved in rate cases and other proceedings with their regulatory commissions in order to establish fair and appropriate electric service rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. Depending on the outcomes, these rate cases and proceedings can have a material impact on results of operations, cash flows and possibly financial condition. AEP is currently involved in the following key proceedings: 
 
 The following tables show the Registrants completed and pending base rate case proceedings in 2024. See Note 4 - Rate Matters for additional information.

Other Significant Regulatory Matters 
 
 Ohio ESP Filings 
 
 In January 2023, OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve an ESP that included proposed rate adjustments, proposed new riders and the continuation and modification of certain existing riders, including the DIR, effective June 2024 through May 2030. The proposal includes a return on common equity of 10.65 on capital costs for certain riders. In June 2023, intervenors filed testimony opposing OPCo s plan for various new riders and modifications to existing riders, including the DIR. In September 2023, OPCo and certain intervenors filed a settlement agreement with the PUCO addressing the ESP application. The settlement included a four year term from June 2024 through May 2028, an ROE of 9.7 and continuation of a number of riders including the DIR subject to revenue caps. In April 2024, the PUCO issued an order approving the settlement agreement. In May 2024, intervenors filed an application for rehearing with the PUCO on the approved settlement agreement and the PUCO denied the intervenors application for rehearing in June 2024. 
 
 SWEPCo 2012 Texas Base Rate Case 
 
 In 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk Plant. In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo s recovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs. Upon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap. In 2017, the Texas District Court upheld the PUCT s 2014 order and intervenors filed appeals with the Texas Third Court of Appeals. In August 2021, the Texas Third Court of Appeals reversed the Texas District Court judgment affirming the PUCT s order on AFUDC, concluding that the language of the PUCT s original 2008 order intended to include AFUDC in the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap, and remanded the case to the PUCT for future proceedings. In November 2021, SWEPCo and the PUCT submitted Petitions for Review with the Texas Supreme Court. In October 2022, the Texas Supreme Court denied the Petitions for Review submitted by SWEPCo and the PUCT. In December 2022, SWEPCo and the PUCT filed requests for rehearing with the Texas Supreme Court. In June 2023, the Texas Supreme Court denied SWEPCo s request for rehearing and the case was remanded to the PUCT for future proceedings. In October 2023, SWEPCo filed testimony with the PUCT in the remanded proceeding recommending no refund or disallowance. 
 
 In December 2023, the PUCT approved a preliminary order stating the PUCT will not address SWEPCo s request that would allow the PUCT to find cause to allow SWEPCo to exceed the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap in the current remand proceeding. As a result of the PUCT s approval of the preliminary order, SWEPCo recorded a pretax, non-cash disallowance of 86 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 The PUCT s December 2023 approval of the preliminary order determined that it will address, in the ongoing PUCT remand proceeding, any potential revenue refunds to customers that may be required by future PUCT orders. On March 1, 2024, SWEPCo filed supplemental direct testimony with the PUCT in response to the December 2023 preliminary order. On March 8, 2024, intervenors and the PUCT staff filed a motion with the PUCT to strike portions of SWEPCo s October 2023 direct testimony and March 2024 supplemental direct testimony. On March 19, 2024, the ALJ granted portions of the motion, which included removal of testimony supporting SWEPCo s position that refunds were not appropriate. On March 28, 2024, SWEPCo filed an appeal of the ALJ decision with the PUCT. In April 2024, intervenors and PUCT staff submitted testimony recommending customer refunds through December 2023 ranging from 149 million to 197 million, including carrying charges, with refund periods ranging from 18 months to 48 months. In May 2024, the PUCT denied SWEPCo s appeal of the ALJ s March 2024 decision. In the second quarter of 2024, based on the PUCT s decision, SWEPCo recorded a one-time, probable revenue refund provision of 160 million, including interest, associated with revenue collected from February 2013 through December 2023. In June 2024, SWEPCo and parties to the remand proceeding reached an agreement in principle that would resolve all issues in the case. In October 2024, SWEPCo filed the settlement agreement with the PUCT. Under the settlement agreement, SWEPCo will refund over a two-year period 148 million, including interest, associated with revenue collected from February 2013 through December 2023 and remove AFUDC in excess of the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap from rate base. The settlement is expected to be considered by the PUCT in the fourth quarter of 2024.

FERC 2021 PJM and SPP Transmission Formula Rate Challenge 
 
 The Registrants transitioned to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in its PJM and SPP transmission formula rates beginning with the 2022 projected transmission revenue requirements and 2021 true-up to actual transmission revenue requirements, and provided notice of this change in informational filings made with the FERC. Stand-alone treatment of the NOLCs for transmission formula rates increased the annual revenue requirements for years 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021 by 52 million, 61 million, 69 million and 78 million, respectively. 
 
 In January 2024, the FERC issued two orders granting formal challenges by certain unaffiliated customers related to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in the 2021 Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP. The FERC directed the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP to provide refunds with interest on all amounts collected for the 2021 rate year, and for such refunds to be reflected in the annual update for the next rate year. Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2024, the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within SPP provided a portion of the 2021 rate year refunds, with the remainder of the refunds expected to be provided in 2025. The AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM are expected to provide their respective refunds for the 2021 rate year in 2025. In February 2024, AEPSC on behalf of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP filed requests for rehearing. In March 2024, the FERC denied AEPSC s requests for rehearing of the January 2024 orders by operation of law and stated it may address the requests for rehearing in future orders. In March 2024, AEPSC submitted refund compliance reports to the FERC, which preserve the non-finality of the FERC s January 2024 orders pending further proceedings on rehearing and appeal. In April 2024, AEPSC made filings with the FERC which request that the FERC: (a) reopen the record so that the FERC may take the IRS PLRs received in April 2024 regarding the treatment of stand-alone NOLCs in ratemaking into evidence and consider them in substantive orders on rehearing and (b) stay its January 2024 orders and related compliance filings and refunds to provide time for consideration of the April 2024 IRS PLRs. In May 2024, AEPSC filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking review of the FERC s January 2024 and March 2024 decisions. In July 2024, the FERC issued orders approving AEPSC s request to reopen the record for the limited purpose of accepting into the record the IRS PLRs and establish additional briefing procedures. In August 2024, AEPSC filed briefs with the FERC requesting the commission modify or overturn their initial orders. 
 
 As a result of the January 2024 FERC orders, the Registrants balance sheets reflect a liability for the probable refund of all NOLC revenues included in transmission formula rates for years 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021, with interest. The Registrants have not yet been directed to make cash refunds related to the 2024, 2023 or 2022 rate years. The probable refunds to affiliated and nonaffiliated customers are reflected as Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets, with the exception of amounts expected to be refunded within one year which are reflected in Other Current Liabilities. Refunds probable to be received by affiliated companies, resulting in a reduction to affiliated transmission expense, were deferred as an increase to Regulatory Liabilities or a reduction to Regulatory Assets on the balance sheets where management expects that refunds would be returned to retail customers through authorized retail jurisdiction rider mechanisms. 
 
 Merchant Portion of Turk Plant 
 
 SWEPCo constructed the Turk Plant, a base load 600 MW (650 MW net maximum capacity) pulverized coal ultra-supercritical generating unit in Arkansas, which was placed in-service in December 2012 and is included in the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment. SWEPCo owns 73 (440 MWs/477 MWs) of the Turk Plant and operates the facility. As of September 30, 2024, the net book value of the Turk Plant was 1.3 billion, before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory. 
 
 Approximately 20 of SWEPCo s portion of the Turk Plant output is currently not subject to cost-based rate recovery in Arkansas. This portion of the plant s output is being sold into the wholesale market. Approximately 80 of the Turk Plant investment is recovered under retail cost-based rate recovery in Texas, Louisiana and through SWEPCo s wholesale customers under FERC-approved rates. In November 2022, SWEPCo filed a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the APSC for approval to operate the Turk Plant to serve Arkansas customers and recover the associated costs through a cost recovery rider. Cost-based recovery of the Turk Plant would aid SWEPCo s near-term capacity needs and support compliance with SPP s 2023 increased capacity planning reserve margin requirements. In April 2023, intervenors filed testimony recommending the APSC deny the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity on the basis that the Turk Plant is not the least cost alternative. In March 2024, the APSC issued an order denying SWEPCo s request to allow the merchant portion of the Turk Plant to serve Arkansas customers. As a result of the APSC s March 2024 order, SWEPCo recorded a 32 million favorable impact to net income as a result of the reduction to the regulatory liability related to the merchant portion of Turk Plant Excess ADIT.

Kentucky Securitization Case 
 
 In January 2024, the KPSC issued a financing order approving KPCo s request to securitize certain regulatory assets balances as of the time securitization bonds are issued and concluding that costs requested for recovery through securitization were prudently incurred. The KPSC s financing order includes certain additional requirements related to securitization bond structuring, marketing, placement and issuance that were not reflected in KPCo s proposal. In accordance with Kentucky statutory requirements and the financing order, the issuance of the securitized bonds is subject to final review by the KPSC after bond pricing. KPCo expects to proceed with the securitized bond issuance process and to complete the securitization process in the first half of 2025, subject to market conditions. As of September 30, 2024, regulatory asset balances expected to be recovered through securitization total 485 million and include: (a) 297 million of plant retirement costs, (b) 79 million of deferred storm costs related to 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 major storms, (c) 49 million of deferred purchased power expenses, (d) 58 million of under-recovered purchased power rider costs and (e) 2 million of deferred issuance-related expenses, including KPSC advisor expenses. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 Investigation of the Service, Rates and Facilities of KPCo 
 
 In June 2023, the KPSC issued an order directing KPCo to show cause why it should not be subject to Kentucky statutory remedies, including fines and penalties, for failure to provide adequate service in its service territory. The KPSC s show cause order did not make any determination regarding the adequacy of KPCo s service. In July 2023, KPCo filed a response to the show cause order demonstrating that it has provided adequate service. In December 2023 and February 2024, KPCo and certain intervenors filed testimony with the KPSC. A hearing with the KPSC was previously scheduled to occur in June 2024. The hearing was postponed and has not yet been rescheduled. If any fines or penalties are levied against KPCo relating to the show cause order, it could reduce net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 KPCo Fuel Adjustment Clause (FAC) Review 
 
 In December 2023, KPCo received intervenor testimony in its FAC review for the two-year period ending October 31, 2022, recommending a disallowance ranging from 44 million to 60 million of its total 432 million purchased power cost recoveries as a result of proposed modifications to the ratemaking methodology that limits purchased power costs recoverable through the FAC. A hearing was held in February 2024 and the KPSC may issue its order in the fourth quarter of 2024 or early 2025. If any fuel costs are not recoverable or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 Virginia Fuel Adjustment Clause (FAC) Review 
 
 In 2023, APCo submitted its annual fuel cost filing with the Virginia SCC. Interim Virginia FAC rates were implemented in November 2023. In APCo's 2022 Virginia fuel update filing, the Virginia staff ordered the Virginia Staff to commence an audit of APCo s fuel costs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. The Virginia staff analyzed APCo s 2019 through 2022 fuel procurement activities and concluded the procurement practices were reasonable and prudent and recommended no disallowances. In May 2024, the Virginia SCC issued an order approving the audit of APCo s 2019 and 2020 fuel costs but concluded that the review of APCo fuel costs for 2021 and 2022 remains open for further evaluation. As of September 30, 2024, APCo had a Virginia jurisdictional under-recovered fuel balance of 164 million. If any fuel costs are not recoverable or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6) 
 
 In July 2019, HB 6, which offered incentives for power-generating facilities with zero or reduced carbon emissions, was signed into law by the Ohio Governor. HB 6 terminated energy efficiency programs as of December 31, 2020, including OPCo s shared savings revenues of 26 million annually and phased out renewable mandates after 2026. HB 6 also provided for continued recovery of existing renewable energy contracts on a bypassable basis through 2032 and included a provision for continued recovery of OVEC costs through 2030 which is allocated to all electric distribution utility customers in Ohio on a non-bypassable basis. OPCo s Inter-Company Power Agreement for OVEC terminates in June 2040. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of the Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, Larry Householder, four other individuals, and Generation Now, an entity registered as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. Certain defendants in that case had previously plead guilty and, in March 2023, a federal jury convicted Larry Householder and another individual of participating in the racketeering conspiracy. In February 2024, an Ohio grand jury indictment charged certain former FirstEnergy executives and the former PUCO Chairman and related entities with various crimes, including bribery. In 2021, four AEP shareholders filed derivative actions purporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. In April 2024, AEP reached an agreement with the four shareholders to fully and 
 9 

finally resolve the derivative actions, and the settlement of those actions was approved in October 2024. See Litigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 section of Litigation below for additional information. 
 
 In March 2021, the Governor of Ohio signed legislation that, among other things, repealed the payments to the nonaffiliated owner of Ohio s nuclear power plants that were previously authorized under HB 6. The new legislation, House Bill 128, went into effect in May 2021 and leaves unchanged other provisions of HB 6 regarding energy efficiency programs, recovery of renewable energy costs and recovery of OVEC costs. To the extent that the law changes or OPCo: (a) is unable to recover the costs of renewable energy contracts on a bypassable basis by the end of 2032, (b) is unable to recover costs of OVEC after 2030 or (c) incurs significant costs associated with the derivative actions, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 Hurricane Helene 
 
 In late September 2024, the remnants of Hurricane Helene significantly impacted APCo s Virginia and West Virginia service territories leading to approximately 260,000 customer outages and damages to APCo s power grid. Storm restoration efforts continued into early October and APCo completed restoration efforts for all customers who lost power by October 6th, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, APCo incurred approximately 19 million 13 million related to the Virginia jurisdiction and 6 million related to the West Virginia jurisdiction) of incremental other operation and maintenance expenses and approximately 8 million of capital expenditures. APCo deferred 16 million of the incremental other operation and maintenance expenses as regulatory assets as the costs are deemed probable of future recovery. Based on the information currently available, APCo estimates total storm restoration costs to be approximately 140 million, of which 70 is expected to be deferred as regulatory assets and the remaining 30 of the costs are expected to be capital expenditures. If any costs related to Hurricane Helene are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 Supply Chain Disruption and Inflation 
 
 The Registrants have experienced certain supply chain disruptions driven by several factors including international tensions and the ramifications of regional conflict, inflation, labor shortages in certain trades and shortages in the availability of certain raw materials. These supply chain disruptions have not had a material impact on the Registrants net income, cash flows and financial condition, but have extended lead times for certain goods and services and have contributed to higher prices for fuel, materials, labor, equipment and other needed commodities. Management has implemented risk mitigation strategies seeking to limit the impacts of these supply chain disruptions. 
 
 The United States economy has experienced a significant level of inflation that has contributed to increased uncertainty in the outlook of near-term economic activity, including whether the pace of inflation will continue to moderate. A prolonged continuation or a further increase in the severity of supply chain and inflationary disruptions could result in additional increases in the cost of certain goods, services and cost of capital and further extend lead times which could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

LITIGATION 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, AEP is involved in employment, commercial, environmental and regulatory litigation. Since it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, management cannot predict the eventual resolution, timing or amount of any loss, fine or penalty. Management assesses the probability of loss for each contingency and accrues a liability for cases that have a probable likelihood of loss if the loss can be estimated. Adverse results in these proceedings have the potential to reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. See Note 4 Rate Matters and Note 5 Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies for additional information. 
 
 Litigation Related to Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6) 
 
 In 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts and OVEC s coal-fired generating units. OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6. In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6. After AEP learned of the criminal allegations against the Ohio legislator and others relating to HB 6, AEP, with assistance from outside advisors, conducted a review of the circumstances surrounding the passage of the bill. Management does not believe that AEP was involved in any wrongful conduct in connection with the passage of HB 6. 
 
 In August 2020, an AEP shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against AEP and certain of its officers for alleged violations of securities laws. In December 2021, the district court issued an opinion and order dismissing the securities litigation complaint with prejudice, determining that the complaint failed to plead any actionable misrepresentations or omissions. The plaintiffs did not appeal the ruling. 
 
 In January 2021, an AEP shareholder filed a derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio purporting to assert claims on behalf of AEP against certain AEP officers and directors. In February 2021, a second AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio. In April 2021, a third AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio and a fourth AEP shareholder filed a similar derivative action in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, Nassau County. These derivative complaints allege the officers and directors made misrepresentations and omissions similar to those alleged in the putative securities class action lawsuit filed against AEP. The derivative complaints (collectively, the Derivative Actions together assert claims for: (a) breach of fiduciary duty, (b) waste of corporate assets, (c) unjust enrichment, (d) breach of duty for insider trading and (e) contribution for violations of sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and seek monetary damages and changes to AEP s corporate governance and internal policies among other forms of relief. The court entered a scheduling order in the New York state court derivative action staying the case other than with respect to briefing the motion to dismiss. AEP filed substantive and forum-based motions to dismiss in April 2022. In June 2022, the Ohio state court entered an order continuing the stays of that case until the final resolution of the consolidated derivative actions pending in Ohio federal district court. In September 2022, the New York state court granted the forum-based motion to dismiss with prejudice and the plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the New York appellate court. In January 2023, the New York plaintiff filed a motion to intervene in the pending Ohio federal court action and withdrew his appeal in New York. The two derivative actions pending in federal district court in Ohio have been consolidated and the plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed an amended complaint. AEP filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and subsequently filed a brief in opposition to the New York plaintiffs motion to intervene in the consolidated action in Ohio. In March 2023, the federal district court issued an order granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice and denying the New York plaintiffs motion to intervene. In April 2023, one of the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit of the Ohio federal district court order dismissing the consolidated action and denying the intervention. 
 
 In March 2021, AEP received a litigation demand letter from counsel representing a purported AEP shareholder. The litigation demand letter was directed to the Board of Directors of AEP (AEP Board) and contained factual allegations involving HB 6 that were generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The shareholder that sent the letter has since withdrawn the litigation demand, which is now terminated and of no further effect. In April 2023, AEP received a litigation demand letter from counsel representing the purported AEP shareholder who had filed the dismissed derivative action in New York state court and unsuccessfully tried to intervene in the consolidated derivative actions in Ohio federal court the (Litigation Demand). The Litigation Demand is directed to the AEP Board and contains factual allegations involving HB 6 that are generally consistent with those in the Derivative Actions. The Litigation Demand requested, among other things, that the AEP Board undertake an independent investigation into alleged legal violations by certain current and former directors and officers, and that AEP commence a civil action asserting claims similar to the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions. The AEP Board considered the Litigation Demand and formed a committee of the Board (the Demand Review Committee) to 
 11 

investigate, review, monitor and analyze the Litigation Demand and make a recommendation to the AEP Board regarding a reasonable and appropriate response to the same. 
 
 In April 2024, AEP reached an agreement with the four shareholders to fully and finally resolve the Derivative Actions and the Litigation Demand, and all claims asserted or that could have been asserted by any AEP shareholder based on the facts alleged, in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the settlement documents (the Settlement). In July 2024, the U.S. District Court preliminarily approved the Settlement. The Settlement includes a payment of 450 thousand for attorneys fees and the implementation of certain governance changes outlined in the Settlement, many of which have already been put in place. The Settlement does not include any admission of liability. In October 2024, the District Court issued an Order and Judgment approving the Settlement and granted an Order of Dismissal with Prejudice. Under the Settlement, all Derivative Actions have been or will be dismissed, the Litigation Demand has been withdrawn, and those matters and claims have been resolved pursuant to the terms of the Settlement. 
 
 In May 2021, AEP received a subpoena from the SEC s Division of Enforcement seeking various documents, including documents relating to the passage of HB 6 and documents relating to AEP s policies and financial processes and controls. In August 2022, AEP received a second subpoena from the SEC seeking various additional documents relating to its ongoing investigation. AEP is cooperating fully with the SEC s investigation, which has included taking testimony from certain individuals and inquiries regarding Empowering Ohio s Economy, Inc., which is a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, and related disclosures. AEP and the SEC are engaged in discussions about a possible resolution of the SEC s investigation and potential claims under the securities laws. Based on these discussions, in the third quarter of 2024, AEP recorded a loss contingency of 19 million in Other Operation expenses on AEP s statements of income and accrued a corresponding liability in Other Current Liabilities on AEP s balance sheets. A resolution of the investigation or claims may subject AEP to civil penalties in an amount that could differ from the amount recorded; however, management does not believe any such resolution would be material. 
 
 Claims for Indemnification Made by Owners of the Gavin Power Station 
 
 In November 2022, the Federal EPA issued a final decision denying Gavin Power LLC s requested extension to allow a CCR surface impoundment at the Gavin Power Station to continue to receive CCR and non-CCR waste streams after April 11, 2021 until May 4, 2023 (the Gavin Denial). As part of the Gavin Denial, the Federal EPA made several assertions related to the CCR Rule (see CCR Rule section below for additional information), including an assertion that the closure of the 300 acre unlined fly ash reservoir (FAR) is noncompliant with the CCR Rule in multiple respects. The Gavin Power Station was formerly owned and operated by AEP and was sold to Gavin Power LLC and Lightstone Generation LLC in 2017. Pursuant to the PSA, AEP maintained responsibility to complete closure of the FAR in accordance with the closure plan approved by the Ohio EPA which was completed in July 2021. The PSA contains indemnification provisions, pursuant to which the owners of the Gavin Power Station have notified AEP they believe they are entitled to indemnification for any damages that may result from these claims, including any future enforcement or litigation resulting from any determinations of noncompliance by the Federal EPA with various aspects of the CCR Rule consistent with the Gavin Denial. The owners of the Gavin Power Station have also sought indemnification for landowner claims for property damage allegedly caused by modifications to the FAR. Management does not believe that the owners of the Gavin Power Station have any valid claim for indemnity or otherwise against AEP under the PSA. In addition, Gavin Power LLC, several AEP subsidiaries, and other parties have filed Petitions for Review of the Gavin Denial with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which in June 2024, were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In January 2024, Gavin Power LLC also filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging various violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and asserting that the Federal EPA, through its prior inaction, has waived and is estopped from raising certain objections raised in the Gavin Denial. Management cannot predict the outcome of that litigation. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring. 
 
 Litigation Regarding Justice Thermal Coal Contract 
 
 In December 2023, APCo filed a suit in the Franklin County Ohio Court of Common Pleas seeking a declaratory judgment confirming APCo s right to terminate a long-term coal contract with Justice Thermal LLC (Justice Thermal) based on Justice Thermal s failure to perform under the contract. APCo terminated that contract in January 2024, and in April 2024, APCo filed an amended complaint seeking a declaration that the termination was proper and also seeking damages for Justice Thermal s breach of contract. Justice Thermal filed an answer and counterclaim in April 2024, contesting the validity of the contract termination and asserting counterclaims. The parties entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release pursuant to which the litigation was dismissed with prejudice in September 2024 and each party released the other from all claims relating to the contract or the litigation, and as a result this matter has been resolved. 
 12 

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
 
 AEP has a substantial capital investment program and incurs additional operational costs to comply with environmental control requirements. Additional investments and operational changes will be made in response to existing and anticipated requirements to reduce emissions from fossil generation and in response to rules governing the beneficial use and disposal of coal combustion by-products, clean water and renewal permits for certain water discharges. 
 
 AEP is engaged in litigation about environmental issues, was notified of potential responsibility for the clean-up of contaminated sites and incurred costs for disposal of SNF and future decommissioning of the nuclear units. Management is engaged in the development of possible future requirements including the items discussed below. 
 
 AEP will seek recovery of expenditures for pollution control technologies and associated costs from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions. Environmental rules could result in accelerated depreciation, impairment of assets or regulatory disallowances. If AEP cannot recover the costs of environmental compliance, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 Impact of Environmental Compliance on the Generating Fleet 
 
 The rules and environmental control requirements discussed below will have a material impact on AEP s operations. As of September 30, 2024, AEP owned generating capacity of approximately 23,000 MWs, of which approximately 10,700 MWs were coal-fired. In April 2024, the Federal EPA announced four major new rules directed at fossil-fuel electric generation facilities. Management continues to evaluate the impacts of these rules on the plans for the future of AEP s generating fleet, in particular, the economic feasibility of making the requisite environmental investments on AEP s fossil generation fleet. AEP continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with these rules to identify the best alternative for ensuring compliance with all of the rules while meeting AEP s obligations to provide reliable and affordable electricity. 
 
 The costs of complying with new rules may also change based on: (a) potential state rules that impose additional more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired and replaced, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and (g) other factors. 
 
 Clean Air Act Requirements 
 
 The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation s air quality and control sources of air emissions. The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements. The primary regulatory programs that continue to drive investments in AEP s existing generating units include: (a) periodic revisions to NAAQS and the development of SIPs to achieve more stringent standards, (b) implementation of the regional haze program by the states and the Federal EPA, (c) regulation of hazardous air pollutant emissions under MATS, (d) implementation and review of CSAPR and (e) the Federal EPA s regulation of GHG emissions from fossil generation under Section 111 of the CAA. Notable developments in significant CAA regulatory requirements affecting AEP s operations are discussed in the following sections. 
 
 National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
 
 The Federal EPA periodically reviews and revises the NAAQS for criteria pollutants under the CAA. Revisions tend to increase the stringency of the standards, which in turn may require AEP to make investments in pollution control equipment at existing generating units, or, since most units are already well controlled, to make changes in how units are dispatched and operated. In February 2024, the Federal EPA finalized a new more stringent annual primary PM 2.5 standard. 
 
 Areas with air quality that does not meet the new standard will be designated by the Federal EPA as nonattainment, which will trigger an obligation for states to revise their SIPs to include additional requirements, resulting in further emission reductions to ensure that the new standard will be met. Areas around some of AEP s generating facilities may be deemed nonattainment, which may require those facilities to install additional pollution controls or to implement operational constraints. The nonattainment designations by the Federal EPA and the subsequent SIP revisions by the affected states will take some time to complete; therefore, management cannot reasonably estimate the impact on AEP s operations, cash flows, net income or financial condition. 
 
 Regional Haze 
 
 The Federal EPA issued a Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in 2005, which could require power plants and other facilities to install best available retrofit technology to address regional haze in federal parks and other protected areas. CAVR is implemented by the states, through SIPs, or by the Federal EPA, through FIPs. In 2017, the Federal EPA revised the rules governing submission of SIPs to implement the visibility programs. Petitions for review of the final rule revisions were filed in 
 13 

the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In early 2018, the Federal EPA announced plans to revisit aspects of the final rule raised by petitioners in petitions for administrative reconsideration, and the court granted the Federal EPA s motion to hold the litigation in abeyance. 
 
 The Federal EPA disapproved portions of the Texas regional haze SIP and finalized a FIP that allows participation in the CSAPR ozone season program to satisfy the NO X regional haze obligations for electric generating units in Texas. Additionally, the Federal EPA finalized an intrastate SO 2 emissions trading program based on CSAPR allowance allocations. Environmental groups filed challenges to these various rulemakings in district courts in the Fifth Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit. Management cannot predict the outcome of that litigation, although management supports the intrastate trading program as a compliance alternative to source-specific controls and intervened in the Fifth Circuit litigation in support of the Federal EPA. In July 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit entered a consent decree setting deadlines for the Federal EPA to rule on Regional Haze SIPs for 33 states, including Texas. In September 2024, the Federal EPA signed a proposed rule to partially approve and partially disapprove the Texas SIP revision. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register in October 2024, initiating a public comment period ending November 14, 2024. The deadline for the Federal EPA to take final action on the Texas SIP is May 30, 2025. 
 
 Cross-State Air Pollution Rule 
 
 CSAPR is a regional trading program that the Federal EPA began implementing in 2015, which was originally designed to address interstate transport of emissions that contribute significantly to nonattainment and interfere with maintenance of the 1997 ozone NAAQS and the 1997 and 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS in downwind states. CSAPR relies on SO 2 and NO X allowances and individual state budgets to compel further emission reductions from electric utility generating units. Interstate trading of allowances is allowed on a restricted basis. The Federal EPA has revised, or updated, the CSAPR trading programs several times since they were established. 
 
 In January 2021, the Federal EPA finalized a revised CSAPR, which substantially reduced the ozone season NO X budgets for several states, including states where AEP operates, beginning in ozone season 2021. AEP has been able to meet the requirements of the revised rule over the first few years of implementation, and is evaluating its compliance options for later years, when the budgets are further reduced. 
 
 In addition, in February 2023, the Federal EPA Administrator finalized the disapproval of interstate transport SIPs submitted by 19 states, including Texas, addressing the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. The Federal EPA disapproved interstate transport SIPs submitted by additional states soon thereafter. Disapproval of the SIPs provided the Federal EPA with authority to impose a FIP for those states, replacing the SIPs that were disapproved. In August 2023, a FIP (the Good Neighbor Plan) went into effect that further revised the ozone season NO X budgets under the existing CSAPR program in states to which the FIP applies. As a result of several separate legal challenges brought by states and industry parties in various federal courts, implementation of the FIP has been stayed in all of the states in which AEP operates. In October 2024, the Federal EPA issued a final rule to administratively stay the effectiveness of the Good Neighbor Plan s requirements for all sources covered by that rule as promulgated where an administrative stay was not already in place. The administrative stay of the Good Neighbor Plan s effectiveness for power plants and other industrial facilities in each of the 23 states will remain in place until the Supreme Court lifts its order staying enforcement of the Good Neighbor Plan, other courts lift any judicial orders staying the SIP disapproval action as to the state, and the Federal EPA takes subsequent rulemaking action consistent with any judicial rulings on the merits. Management will continue to monitor the outcome of this litigation and the development of SIPs for any potential impact to operations. 
 
 Climate Change, CO 2 Regulation and Energy Policy 
 
 In April 2024, the Administrator of the Federal EPA signed new GHG standards and guidelines for new and existing fossil-fuel fired sources. The rule relies on carbon capture and sequestration and natural gas co-firing as means to reduce CO 2 emissions from coal fired plants and carbon capture and sequestration or limited utilization to reduce CO 2 emissions from new gas turbines. The rule also offers early retirement of coal plants in lieu of carbon capture and storage as an alternative means of compliance. The Federal EPA deferred the finalization of standards for existing gas turbines until later in 2024. AEP is in the early stages of evaluating and identifying the best strategy for complying with this and other new rules, discussed below, while ensuring the adequacy of resources to meet customer needs. The rule has been challenged by 27 states, numerous companies, trade associations and others. AEP has joined with several other utilities to challenge the rule and has asked the court to stay the rule during the litigation, and the appeals have been consolidated. In July 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied those motions to stay and several parties, including AEP and other utilities, filed applications with the United States Supreme Court seeking an emergency stay. The Supreme Court denied those applications in October 2024 and the litigation will continue to proceed before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Excessive costs to comply with environmental regulations have led to the announcement of early plant closures across the country. The Federal EPA s new GHG rules, and suite of other new rules issued simultaneously which are discussed below, are directed at the fossil- 
 14 

fuel fired electric utility industry and could force AEP to close additional coal-fired generation facilities earlier than their estimated useful life. If AEP is unable to recover the costs of its investments, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 AEP routinely submits IRPs in various regulatory jurisdictions to address future generation and capacity needs. These IRPs take into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and resilience, regulations and RTO capacity requirements. The objective of the IRPs is to recommend future generation and capacity resources that provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers. Based on the output of these IRPs, in October 2022, AEP modified its intermediate and long-term GHG emission reduction goals. The intermediate goal is an 80 reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions by 2030 (from a 2005 baseline) and the long-term goal is net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2045. AEP s total Scope 1 GHG estimated emissions in 2023 were approximately 43.4 million metric tons, a 68 reduction according to the GHG Protocol, which excludes emission reductions that result from assets that have been sold, or a 71 reduction from AEP s 2005 Scope 1 GHG emissions (inclusive of emission reductions that result from plants that have been sold). AEP expects its Scope 1 GHG emissions to vary annually depending on the proportion of its own generation and purchased power used to serve customers as well as load growth on the system. 
 
 AEP has made significant progress in reducing CO 2 emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to continue to decline over the long-term due to the retirement of certain fossil fuel generation units and increased energy efficiency, where there is regulatory support for such activities. AEP s ability to achieve its GHG emission goals, and the modification of such goals in the future, are dependent upon a number of factors including continuing to provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers, changes in load growth across our service territory, IRPs submitted in various jurisdictions and the preferences of state regulators and policymakers for dispatchable or renewable generation resources, evolving RTO requirements, the advancement of carbon-free generation technologies, customer demand for carbon-free energy, potential tariffs, carbon policy and regulation, operational performance of renewable generation, supply chain costs and constraints, and ability to use carbon offsets. Based on AEP s most recent analysis, AEP currently projects that achievement of its net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2045 long-term goal would require the development of new carbon-free generation technologies, a decline in forecasted customer load, use of carbon offsets or other future changes. 
 
 MATS Rule 
 
 In April 2024, the Federal EPA issued a revised MATS rule for power plants. The rule includes a more stringent standard for emissions of filterable PM for coal-fired electric generating units, as well as a new mercury standard for lignite-fired electric generating units. The rule also requires the installation and operation of continuous emissions monitors for PM. Several states and other parties have challenged the rule in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but management cannot predict the outcome of the litigation. Management is evaluating the impacts of the rule, but does not anticipate any significant challenges complying with the rule. 
 
 CCR Rule 
 
 The Federal EPA s CCR Rule regulates the disposal and beneficial re-use of CCR, including fly ash and bottom ash created from coal-fired generating units and FGD gypsum generated at some coal-fired plants. The original rule applied to active and inactive CCR landfills and surface impoundments at facilities of active electric utility or independent power producers. With revisions announced in April 2024, the scope of the rule has expanded significantly, to include inactive impoundments at inactive facilities legacy CCR surface impoundments as well as to establish requirements for currently exempt solid waste management units that involve the direct placement of CCR on the land CCR management units ). 
 
 In 2020, the Federal EPA revised the original CCR Rule to include a requirement that unlined CCR storage ponds cease operations and initiate closure by April 11, 2021. The revised rule provides two options that allow facilities to extend the date by which they must cease receipt of coal ash and close the ponds. 
 
 The first option provided an extension to cease receipt of CCR no later than October 15, 2023 for most units, and October 15, 2024 for a narrow subset of units; however, the Federal EPA s grant of such an extension requires a satisfactory demonstration of the need for additional time to develop alternative ash disposal capacity and will be limited to the soonest timeframe technically feasible to cease receipt of CCR. Additionally, each request must undergo formal review, including public comments, and be approved by the Federal EPA. AEP had filed several applications for additional time to develop alternative disposal capacity at the various plants. AEP has since ceased receiving ash in the ponds subject to the extension requests, completed construction of new CCR Rule compliant facilities and has withdrawn those applications as moot. 
 
 In January 2022, the Federal EPA proposed to deny several extension requests filed by the other utilities based on allegations that those utilities are not in compliance with the CCR Rule (the January Actions). In November 2022, the Federal EPA finalized one of these denials (the Gavin Denial, discussed above). The Federal EPA s allegations of noncompliance rely on what AEP and others believe are new interpretations of the CCR Rule requirements. The new interpretations in the January 
 15 

Actions of the Federal EPA and the Gavin Denial were challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as unlawful rulemaking that revises the existing CCR Rule requirements without proper notice and without opportunity for comment. In June 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Federal EPA s January actions and statements made in the Gavin Denial did not constitute new agency rules subject to review by the court. The court dismissed the appeals for lack of jurisdiction. 
 
 Under the second option for obtaining an extension of the April 11, 2021 deadline to cease operation of unlined impoundments, a generating facility may continue operating its existing impoundments without developing alternative CCR disposal, provided the facility commits to cease combustion of coal by a date certain. Under this option, a generating facility had until October 17, 2023 to cease coal-fired operations and to close CCR storage ponds 40 acres or less in size, or through October 17, 2028 for facilities with CCR storage ponds greater than 40 acres in size. Pursuant to this option, AEP informed the Federal EPA of its intent to retire the Pirkey Plant and cease using coal at the Welsh Plant. In March 2023, the Pirkey Plant was retired. To date, the Federal EPA has not taken any action on the pending extension request for the Welsh Plant. 
 
 In April 2024, the Federal EPA finalized revisions to the CCR Rule to expand the scope of the rule to include inactive impoundments at inactive facilities legacy CCR surface impoundments as well as to establish requirements for currently exempt solid waste management units that involve the direct placement of CCR on the land CCR management units ). The Federal EPA is requiring that owners and operators of legacy surface impoundments comply with all of the existing CCR Rule requirements applicable to inactive CCR surface impoundments at active facilities, except for the location restrictions and liner design criteria. The rule establishes compliance deadlines for legacy surface impoundments to meet regulatory requirements, including a requirement to initiate closure within five years after the effective date of the final rule. The rule requires evaluations to be completed at both active facilities and inactive facilities with one or more legacy surface impoundments. Closure may be accomplished by applying an impermeable cover system over the CCR material closure in place or the CCR material may be excavated and placed in a compliant landfill closure by removal ). Groundwater monitoring and other analysis over the next three years will provide additional information on the planned closure method. AEP evaluated the applicability of the rule to current and former plant sites and recorded incremental ARO in the second quarter of 2024, as shown in the table below, based on initial cost estimates primarily reflecting compliance with the rule through closure in place and future groundwater monitoring requirements pursuant to the CCR Rule. 
 
 Registrant Increase in ARO Increase in Generation Property (a) Increase in Regulatory Assets (b) Charged to Operating Expenses (c) (in millions) APCo 312.2 75.6 236.6 I M 85.7 72.3 13.4 OPCo 52.9 52.9 PSO 33.7 33.7 SWEPCo 23.8 23.8 Non-Registrants 166.1 43.8 46.1 76.2 Total 674.4 176.9 355.0 142.5 
 
 (a) ARO is related to a legacy CCR surface impoundment or CCR management unit at an operating generation facility. 
 (b) ARO is related to a legacy CCR surface impoundment or CCR management unit at a retired generation facility and recognition of a regulatory asset in accordance with the accounting guidance for Regulated Operations is supported. 
 (c) ARO is related to a legacy CCR surface impoundment or CCR management unit and recognition of a regulatory asset in accordance with the accounting guidance for Regulated Operations is not yet supported. 
 
 As further groundwater monitoring and other analysis is performed, management expects to refine the assumptions and underlying cost estimates used in recording the ARO. These refinements may include, but are not limited to, changes in the expected method of closure, changes in estimated quantities of CCR at each site, the identification of new CCR management units, among other items. These future changes could have a material impact on the ARO and materially reduce future net income and cash flows and further impact financial condition. 
 
 AEP will seek cost recovery through regulated rates, including proposal of new regulatory mechanisms for cost recovery where existing mechanisms are not applicable. The rule could have an additional, material adverse impact on net income, cash flows and financial condition if AEP cannot ultimately recover these additional costs of compliance. Several parties, including AEP and one of its trade associations, have filed petitions for review of the rule with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. One of the parties also filed a motion to stay the rule pending the outcome of the litigation. In November 2024, the court denied the stay motion. Management cannot predict the outcome of the litigation.

Clean Water Act Regulations 
 
 The Federal EPA s ELG rule for generating facilities establishes limits for FGD wastewater, fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater, which are to be implemented through each facility s wastewater discharge permit. A revision to the ELG rule, published in October 2020, established additional options for reusing and discharging small volumes of bottom ash transport water, provided an exception for retiring units and extended the compliance deadline to a date as soon as possible beginning one year after the rule was published but no later than December 2025. Management has assessed technology additions and retrofits to comply with the rule and the impacts of the Federal EPA s actions on facilities wastewater discharge permitting for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water. For affected facilities required to install additional technologies to meet the ELG rule limits, permit modifications were filed in January 2021 that reflect the outcome of that assessment. AEP continues to work with state agencies to finalize permit terms and conditions. Other facilities opted to file Notices of Planned Participation (NOPP), pursuant to which the facilities are not required to install additional controls to meet ELG limits provided they make commitments to cease coal combustion by a date certain. In April 2024, the Federal EPA finalized further revisions to the ELG rule that establish a zero liquid discharge standard for FGD wastewater, bottom ash transport water, and managed combustion residual leachate, as well as more stringent discharge limits for unmanaged combustion residual leachate. The revised rule provides a new compliance alternative that would avoid the need to install zero liquid discharge systems for facilities that comply with the 2020 rule s control technology requirements and commit by December 31, 2025 to retire by 2034. Management is evaluating the compliance alternatives in the rule, taking into consideration the requirements of the other new rules and their combined impacts to operations. Several appeals have been filed with various federal courts challenging the 2024 ELG rule. SWEPCo has also challenged the rule, by filing a joint appeal with a utility trade association in which AEP participates. The various appeals have been consolidated before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. SWEPCo and the utility trade association filed a motion to stay the rule during the litigation, but in October 2024, the court denied the motion. Management cannot predict the outcome of the litigation. 
 
 The definition of waters of the United States has been subject to rule-making and litigation which has led to inconsistent scope among the states. Management will continue to monitor developments in rule-making and litigation for any potential impact to operations. 
 
 Impact of Environmental Regulation on Coal-Fired Generation 
 
 Compliance with extensive environmental regulations requires significant capital investment in environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal, remediation and permits. Management continuously evaluates cost estimates of complying with these regulations which may result in a decision to retire coal-fired generating facilities earlier than their currently estimated useful lives. 
 
 The table below summarizes the net book value, as of September 30, 2024, of generating facilities retired or planned for early retirement in advance of the retirement date currently authorized for ratemaking purposes: 
 Company Plant Net Investment (a) Accelerated Depreciation Regulatory Asset Actual/Projected Retirement Date Current Authorized Recovery Period Annual Depreciation (b) (in millions) (in millions) PSO Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 111.9 181.2 2026 (c) 15.7 SWEPCo Pirkey Plant 120.8 (d) 2023 (e) SWEPCo Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 341.4 156.7 2028 (f) (g) 41.6 
 
 (a) Net book value, including CWIP, excluding cost of removal and materials and supplies. 
 (b) These amounts represent the amount of annual depreciation that has been collected from customers over the prior 12-month period. 
 (c) Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 is currently being recovered through 2040. 
 (d) Represents Arkansas and Texas jurisdictional share. 
 (e) As part of the 2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case, the APSC granted SWEPCo regulatory asset treatment. SWEPCo will request recovery including a weighted average cost of capital carrying charge through a future proceeding. The Texas share of the Pirkey Plant will be addressed in SWEPCo s next base rate case. See the Regulated Generating Units section of Note 4 for additional information. 
 (f) In November 2020, management announced it will cease using coal at the Welsh Plant in 2028. Management is evaluating a potential conversion to natural gas after 2028 for both units. 
 (g) Welsh Plant, Unit 1 is being recovered through 2027 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2037 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions. Welsh Plant, Unit 3 is being recovered through 2032 in the Louisiana jurisdiction and through 2042 in the Arkansas and Texas jurisdictions. 
 
 Management is seeking or will seek regulatory recovery, as necessary, for any net book value remaining when the plants are retired. To the extent the net book value of these generation assets is not deemed recoverable, it could materially reduce future net income, cash flows and impact financial condition.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 AEP s Reportable Segments 
 
 AEP s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight. Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements. AEP s reportable segments are as follows: 
 
 Vertically Integrated Utilities 
 Transmission and Distribution Utilities 
 AEP Transmission Holdco 
 Generation Marketing 
 
 The remainder of AEP s activities are presented as Corporate and Other, which is not considered a reportable segment. See Note 8 - Business Segments for additional information on AEP s segments. 
 
 The following discussion of AEP s results of operations by operating segment provides a comparison of Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders for the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2023. For AEP s Vertically Integrated Utilities and Transmission and Distribution Utilities segments and subsidiary registrants within these segments, the results include revenues from rate rider mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power and other recoverable expenses such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect Earnings Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders.

 Third Quarter of 2024 Compared to Third Quarter of 2023 
 
 The major components of the increase in Revenues were as follows: 
 
 Retail Revenues increased 43 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 30 million increase in rider revenues at APCo and WPCo. 
 A 23 million increase in rates due to the 2020-2022 Virginia Triennial Review at APCo. 
 A 19 million increase in rider revenues at KPCo. 
 A 15 million increase in rider revenues at I M. 
 A 10 million increase in weather-normalized revenues primarily in the residential and commercial classes, partially offset by a decrease in the industrial class. 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 A 50 million decrease in fuel revenues primarily due to lower authorized fuel rates at PSO. 
 A 12 million decrease due to regulatory provisions for refund at I M. 
 Off-system Sales increased 25 million primarily due to economic hedging activity and Rockport Plant, Unit 2 merchant sales at I M. 
 Transmission Revenues increased 24 million primarily due to continued investment in transmission assets. 
 Other Revenues increased 6 million primarily due to an increase in sales of renewable energy credits and pole attachment revenue. 
 22 

Expenses and Other and Income Tax Benefit changed between years as follows: 
 
 Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation decreased 37 million primarily due to decreases at PSO, SWEPCo and I M, partially offset by an increase at APCo. 
 Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased 52 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 37 million increase in PJM and SPP transmission services. 
 A 20 million increase due to prior year proceeds for insurance policy settlements. 
 Depreciation and Amortization increased 50 million primarily due to a higher depreciable base at APCo, PSO and SWEPCo, an increase in regulatory reserves related to the recognition of Nuclear PTCs at I M and an increase in amortization of regulatory assets at PSO and SWEPCo. 
 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased 6 million primarily due to increased property taxes at APCo, KPCo and PSO. 
 Non-Service Cost Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost increased 5 million primarily due to the expiration of prior service credit amortization from previous plan changes, partially offset by lower loss amortization resulting from favorable asset returns during 2023 and lower interest costs due to lower discount rates. 
 Interest Expense decreased 7 million primarily due to the prior year amortization of carrying charges on storm-related regulatory assets at SWEPCo. 
 Income Tax Benefit increased 32 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 61 million increase due to estimated Nuclear PTCs at I M. 
 This increase was partially offset by: 
 A 22 million decrease due to a decrease in amortization of Excess ADIT. 
 A 6 million decrease due to a decrease in pretax book income. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The major components of the increase in Revenues were as follows: 
 
 Retail Revenues increased 37 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 91 million increase in rider revenues at APCo and WPCo. 
 A 91 million increase in weather-related usage primarily in the residential class driven by a 12 increase in cooling degree days. 
 A 60 million increase in rates at APCo due to the 2020-2022 Virginia Triennial Review. 
 A 49 million increase in rider revenues at KPCo. 
 A 32 million increase in base rate and rider revenues at PSO. 
 A 12 million increase at I M due to the implementation of new base rates in Indiana and Michigan. 
 A 9 million increase in rider revenues at I M. 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 A 176 million decrease at SWEPCo primarily due to the recognition of a 160 million probable revenue refund associated with the Turk Plant and SWEPCo s 2012 Texas Base Rate Case. 
 A 106 million decrease in fuel revenues primarily due to lower authorized fuel rates at PSO. 
 A 34 million decrease due to regulatory provisions for refund at I M. 
 Off-system Sales increased 28 million primarily due to economic hedging activity and Rockport Plant, Unit 2 merchant sales at I M. 
 Transmission Revenues increased 39 million primarily due to continued investment in transmission assets. 
 Other Revenues increased 28 million primarily due to associated business development revenues at PSO and SWEPCo and pole attachment revenue at APCo. 
 
 Expenses and Other and Income Tax Benefit changed between years as follows: 
 
 Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expenses decreased 19 million primarily due to decreases at PSO and SWEPCo, partially offset by increases at APCo and I M. 
 Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased 239 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 111 million increase in PJM and SPP transmission services. 
 A 76 million increase in employee-related expenses due to the voluntary severance program. 
 A 20 million increase due to prior year proceeds for insurance policy settlements. 
 A 14 million increase due to a disallowance recorded on the remaining net book value of the Dolet Hills Power Station as a result of an LPSC approved settlement agreement in April 2024. 
 23 

Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges increased 13 million due to the Federal EPA s revised CCR rules. 
 Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased 59 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 31 million increase at SWEPCo primarily due to an increase in amortization of regulatory assets and a higher depreciable base, partially offset by the recognition of a regulatory asset related to NOLCs. 
 A 20 million increase at APCo primarily due to a higher depreciable base. 
 A 14 million increase at PSO primarily due to a higher depreciable base, implementation of new rates and the amortization of regulatory assets related to NCWF. 
 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased 20 million primarily due to increased property taxes at PSO, I M and KPCo and an increase in Virginia state minimum taxes at APCo, partially offset by a decrease in property taxes at SWEPCo. 
 Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction increased 7 million primarily due to higher CWIP and AFUDC equity rates. 
 Non-Service Cost Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost increased 21 million primarily due to the expiration of prior service credit amortization from previous plan changes, partially offset by lower loss amortization resulting from favorable asset returns during 2023 and lower interest costs due to lower discount rates.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 AEP measures financial condition by the strength of its balance sheet and the liquidity provided by its cash flows. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Debt and Equity Capitalization 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions) Long-term Debt, including amounts due within one year 41,974.4 59.7 40,143.2 58.8 Short-term Debt 1,659.6 2.4 2,830.2 4.2 Total Debt 43,634.0 62.1 42,973.4 63.0 AEP Common Equity 26,617.4 37.9 25,246.7 37.0 Noncontrolling Interests 41.4 39.2 Total Debt and Equity Capitalization 70,292.8 100.0 68,259.3 100.0 
 
 AEP s ratio of debt-to-total capital decreased from 63.0 to 62.1 as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to an increase in earnings and equity issued under the ATM program in 2024, partially offset by an increase in long-term debt to support distribution and transmission investment growth in addition to working capital needs. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining AEP s financial stability. Management believes AEP has adequate liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, AEP had 6 billion of revolving credit facilities to support its commercial paper program. Additional liquidity is available from cash from operations and a receivables securitization agreement. Management is committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. AEP generally uses short-term borrowings to fund working capital needs, property acquisitions and construction until long-term funding is arranged. Sources of long-term funding include issuance of long-term debt, long-term asset securitizations, leasing agreements, hybrid securities or common stock. AEP and its utilities finance its operations with commercial paper and other variable rate instruments that are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. To the extent that there is an increase in interest rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 Market volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness. AEP continues monitoring the current bank environment and any impacts thereof. AEP was not materially impacted by these conditions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net Available Liquidity 
 
 AEP manages liquidity by maintaining adequate external financing commitments. As of September 30, 2024, available liquidity was approximately 5.5 billion as illustrated in the table below: 
 
 Amount Maturity (a) Commercial Paper Backup: (in millions) Revolving Credit Facility 5,000.0 March 2029 Revolving Credit Facility 1,000.0 March 2027 Cash and Cash Equivalents 245.8 Total Liquidity Sources 6,245.8 Less: AEP Commercial Paper Outstanding 755.0 Net Available Liquidity 5,490.8 
 
 (a) In March 2024, AEP increased its 4 billion Revolving Credit Facility to 5 billion and extended the maturity date from March 2027 to March 2029. Also, in March 2024, AEP extended the maturity date of its 1 billion Revolving Credit Facility from March 2025 to March 2027. 
 
 34 

AEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries. The program funds a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries; and the short-term debt requirements of subsidiaries that are not participating in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons, as direct borrowers. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during the first nine months of 2024 was 2.9 billion. The weighted-average interest rate for AEP s commercial paper during 2024 was 5.55 . 
 
 Other Credit Facilities 
 
 An uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility. AEP issues letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under six uncommitted facilities totaling 450 million. The Registrants maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities as of September 30, 2024 was 236 million with maturities ranging from October 2024 to July 2025. 
 
 Securitized Accounts Receivables 
 
 AEP Credit s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of 900 million from bank conduits to purchase receivables and expires in September 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the affiliated utility subsidiaries were in compliance with all requirements under the agreement. 
 
 Debt Covenants and Borrowing Limitations 
 
 AEP s credit agreements contain certain covenants and require it to maintain a percentage of debt-to-total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5 . The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in AEP s credit agreements. Debt as defined in the revolving credit agreement excludes securitization bonds and debt of AEP Credit. As of September 30, 2024, this contractually-defined percentage was 58.8 . Non-performance under these covenants could result in an event of default under these credit agreements. In addition, the acceleration of AEP s payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of AEP s major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of 100 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements. This condition also applies, at the more restrictive level of 50 million of debt outstanding, in a majority of AEP s non-exchange-traded commodity contracts and would similarly allow lenders and counterparties to declare the outstanding amounts payable. However, a default under AEP s non-exchange-traded commodity contracts would not cause an event of default under its credit agreements. 
 
 The revolving credit facilities do not permit the lenders to refuse a draw on any facility if a material adverse change occurs. 
 
 Utility Money Pool borrowings and external borrowings may not exceed amounts authorized by regulatory orders and AEP manages its borrowings to stay within those authorized limits. 
 
 ATM Program 
 
 AEP participates in an ATM program that allows AEP to issue, from time to time, shares of its common stock, including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to an equity forward sales agreement. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1.3 billion of equity is available for issuance under the ATM program. See Note 12 - Financing Activities for additional information. 
 
 Dividend Policy and Restrictions 
 
 The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.93 per share in October 2024. Future dividends may vary depending upon AEP s profit levels, operating cash flow levels and capital requirements, as well as financial and other business conditions existing at the time. Parent s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries. Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends. Management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant impact on its ability to access cash to meet the payment of dividends on its common stock. See Dividend Restrictions section of Note 12 for additional information. 
 
 Credit Ratings 
 
 AEP and its utility subsidiaries do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit downgrade, but its access to the commercial paper market may depend on its credit ratings. In addition, downgrades in AEP s credit ratings by one of the rating agencies could increase its borrowing costs. Counterparty concerns about the credit quality of AEP or its utility subsidiaries could subject AEP to additional collateral demands under adequate assurance clauses under its derivative and non-derivative energy contracts. 
 35 

CASH FLOW 
 
 AEP relies primarily on cash flows from operations, debt issuances, issuances of common stock under the ATM program and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and investing activities. AEP s investing and capital requirements are primarily capital expenditures, repaying of long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. AEP uses short-term debt, including commercial paper and bank term loans, as a bridge to long-term debt financing. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows.

 (a) Non-Cash Adjustments to Net Income includes Depreciation and Amortization, Deferred Income Taxes, Loss on the Sale of the Competitive Contracted Renewables Portfolio, Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges and AFUDC. 
 
 Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities increased by 1.4 billion primarily due to the following: 
 A 758 million increase in cash from the Change in Certain Components of Working Capital. The increase is primarily due to a decrease in fuel, material and supplies driven by lower coal inventory on hand, employee-related benefits and proceeds received from the sale of transferable tax credits. These increases were partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable collections. 
 A 506 million increase in cash from Net Income, after non-cash adjustments. See Results of Operations for further detail. 
 A 368 million increase in cash from Change in Other Noncurrent Assets and Change in Other Noncurrent Liabilities. This increase is primarily due to changes in regulatory assets and liabilities driven by timing differences between collections from and refunds to customers under rate rider mechanisms. 
 These increases in cash were partially offset by: 
 A 238 million decrease in cash primarily due to the timing of fuel and purchase power related revenues and expenses.

 This decrease in cash was partially offset by: 
 A 599 million decrease in Construction Expenditures primarily due to decreases in Vertically Integrated Utilities of 243 million, Transmission and Distribution Utilities of 213 million and AEP Transmission Holdco of 128 million. 
 A 146 million increase in cash due to the 2023 acquisition of the Rock Falls Wind Facility. See Rock Falls Wind Facility section of Note 6 for additional information.

 A 446 million decrease in issuances of common stock primarily due to the settlement of equity units in 2023 partially offset by issuances under the ATM program in 2024. See Note 12 - Financing Activities for additional information. 
 A 269 million decrease in issuances of long-term debt. See Note 12 - Financing Activities for additional information. 
 These decreases in cash were partially offset by: 
 A 211 million increase due to changes in short-term debt. See Note 12 - Financing Activities for additional information. 
 
 See the Long-term Debt Subsequent Events section of Note 12 for Long-term debt and other securities issued, retired and principal payments made after September 30, 2024 through November 6, 2024, the date that the third quarter 10-Q was filed.

BUDGETED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 
 
 Management forecasts approximately 8.5 billion of capital expenditures in 2024. For the five year period, 2025 through 2029, management forecasts capital expenditures of 54.4 billion . Management s forecasted capital expenditures for 2025 to 2029 reflect planned increases in investments for transmission infrastructure and new generation resources to support forecasted large load increases and continued improvements in distribution system reliability. 
 
 The expenditures are generally for transmission, generation, distribution, regulated renewables and required environmental investment to comply with the Federal EPA rules. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, supply chain issues, weather, legal reviews, inflation and the ability to access capital. Management expects to fund these capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, proceeds from the strategic sale of assets and financing activities. Generally, the Registrant Subsidiaries use cash or short-term borrowings under the money pool to fund these expenditures until long-term funding is arranged. 
 
 The 2025-2029 estimated capital expenditures by Business Segment are as follows: 
 Segment 2025-2029 Budgeted Capital Expenditures (in millions) Vertically Integrated Utilities 30,972 Transmission and Distribution Utilities 14,162 AEP Transmission Holdco 8,590 Generation Marketing 112 Corporate and Other 553 Total 54,389 

SIGNIFICANT CASH REQUIREMENTS 
 
 A summary of significant cash requirements is included in the 2023 Annual Report and has not changed significantly from year-end other than the debt issuances and retirements discussed in the Cash Flow section above.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 See the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2023 Annual Report for a discussion of the estimates and judgments required for regulatory accounting, revenue recognition, derivative instruments, the valuation of long-lived assets, the accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits and the impact of new accounting standards and SEC rulemaking activity. 
 
 AROs 
 
 AROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment. When recording an ARO, the present value of the projected liability is recognized in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred or enacted, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The liability is accreted over time. For operating facilities, the present value of the liability is added to the cost of the associated asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. For retired facilities, the present value of the liability is expensed, and where future recovery through rates is probable, the present value of the liability is subsequently deferred as a regulatory asset. The present value of the initial ARO and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash flows, discount rates and cost escalation rates. These estimates are subject to change. Depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively for any changes to the carrying amount of the associated asset. 
 
 ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market Risks 
 
 The Vertically Integrated Utilities segment is exposed to certain market risks as a major power producer and through transactions in power, coal, natural gas and marketing contracts. These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk. These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates. 
 
 The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment is exposed to energy procurement risk and interest rate risk. 
 
 The Generation Marketing segment conducts marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO. This segment is exposed to certain market risks as a marketer of wholesale and retail electricity. These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk. These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates. In addition, the Generation Marketing segment is also exposed to certain market risks as a power producer and through transactions in wholesale electricity, natural gas and marketing contracts. 
 
 Management employs risk management contracts including physical forward and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts. Management engages in risk management of power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business. As a result, AEP is subject to price risk. The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. AEPSC s market risk oversight staff independently monitors risk policies, procedures and risk levels and provides members of the Regulated Risk Committee and the Energy Supply Risk Committee (Competitive Risk Committee) various reports regarding compliance with policies, limits and procedures. The Regulated Risk Committee consists of AEPSC s Chief Financial Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President Regulatory and Chief Administrative Officer, Executive Vice President Grid Solutions Government Affairs, Senior Vice President of Regulated Commercial Operations and Senior Vice President of Treasury and Risk. The Competitive Risk Committee consists of AEPSC s Chief Financial Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Risk and Senior Vice President of Competitive Commercial Operations. When commercial activities exceed predetermined limits, positions are modified to reduce the risk to be within the limits unless specifically approved by the respective committee. 
 
 The following table summarizes the reasons for changes in total MTM value as compared to December 31, 2023:

 39 

(a) Reflects fair value on primarily auctions or long-term structured contracts which are typically with customers that seek fixed pricing to limit their risk against fluctuating energy prices. The contract prices are valued against market curves associated with the delivery location and delivery term. A significant portion of the total volumetric position has been economically hedged. 
 (b) Market fluctuations are attributable to various factors such as supply/demand, weather, etc. 
 (c) Relates to the net gains (losses) of those contracts that are not reflected on the statements of income. These net gains (losses) are recorded as regulatory liabilities/assets or accounts payable on the balance sheet. 
 
 See Note 9 Derivatives and Hedging and Note 10 Fair Value Measurements for additional information related to risk management contracts. The following tables and discussion provide information on credit risk and market volatility risk. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Credit risk is mitigated in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis. Management uses credit agency ratings and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial statements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis. 
 
 AEP has risk management contracts (includes non-derivative contracts) with numerous counterparties. Since open risk management contracts are valued based on changes in market prices of the related commodities, exposures change daily. As of September 30, 2024, credit exposure net of collateral to sub investment grade counterparties was approximately 6.4 , expressed in terms of net MTM assets, net receivables and the net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM (representing economic risk even though there may not be risk of accounting loss). 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the following table approximates AEP s counterparty credit quality and exposure based on netting across commodities, instruments and legal entities where applicable: 
 Counterparty Credit Quality Exposure Before Credit Collateral Credit Collateral Net Exposure Number of Counterparties >10 of Net Exposure Net Exposure of Counterparties >10 (in millions, except number of counterparties) Investment Grade 590.6 43.4 547.2 3 328.9 Split Rating 10.4 10.4 1 10.4 Noninvestment Grade 5.1 5.1 2 5.1 No External Ratings: Internal Investment Grade 19.6 19.6 2 13.2 Internal Noninvestment Grade 81.9 47.3 34.6 2 23.9 Total as of September 30, 2024 707.6 90.7 616.9 
 
 All exposure in the table above relates to AEPSC and AEPEP as AEPSC is agent for and transacts on behalf of certain AEP subsidiaries, including the Registrant Subsidiaries and AEPEP is agent for and transacts on behalf of other AEP subsidiaries. 
 
 In addition, AEP is exposed to credit risk related to participation in RTOs. For each of the RTOs in which AEP participates, this risk is generally determined based on the proportionate share of member gross activity over a specified period of time. 
 
 Value at Risk (VaR) Associated with Risk Management Contracts 
 
 Management uses a risk measurement model, which calculates VaR, to measure AEP s commodity price risk in the risk management portfolio. The VaR is based on the variance-covariance method using historical prices to estimate volatilities and correlations and assumes a 95 confidence level and a one-day holding period. Based on this VaR analysis, as of September 30, 2024, a near term typical change in commodity prices is not expected to materially impact net income, cash flows or financial condition. 
 
 Management calculates the VaR for both a trading and non-trading portfolio. The trading portfolio consists primarily of contracts related to energy trading and marketing activities. The non-trading portfolio consists primarily of economic hedges of generation and retail supply activities. 

40 

The following tables show the end, high, average and low market risk as measured by VaR for the periods indicated: 
 
 VaR Model 
 Trading Portfolio 
 Nine Months Ended Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 End High Average Low End High Average Low (in millions) (in millions) 0.3 1.7 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.9 0.2 0.1 
 
 VaR Model 
 Non-Trading Portfolio 
 Nine Months Ended Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 End High Average Low End High Average Low (in millions) (in millions) 15.4 98.6 20.6 7.6 17.7 32.7 16.4 6.1 
 
 Management back-tests VaR results against performance due to actual price movements. Based on the assumed 95 confidence interval, the performance due to actual price movements would be expected to exceed the VaR at least once every 20 trading days. 
 
 As the VaR calculation captures recent price movements, management also performs regular stress testing of the trading portfolio to understand AEP s exposure to extreme price movements. A historical-based method is employed whereby the current trading portfolio is subjected to actual, observed price movements from the last several years in order to ascertain which historical price movements translated into the largest potential MTM loss. Management then researches the underlying positions, price movements and market events that created the most significant exposure and reports the findings to the Risk Executive Committee, Regulated Risk Committee or Competitive Risk Committee as appropriate. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 AEP is exposed to interest rate market fluctuations in the normal course of business operations. Prior to 2022, interest rates remained at low levels and the Federal Reserve maintained the federal funds target range at 0.0 to 0.25 for much of 2021. During 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve approved 11 rate increases for a cumulative total of 5.25 increase. In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, in September 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 0.50 . AEP has outstanding short and long-term debt which is subject to variable rates. AEP manages interest rate risk by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt, by entering into interest rate derivative instruments and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on AEP s variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense annually by 21 million and 45 million, respectively.

 A 28 million increase due to a prior year decrease in expenses driven by legislation passed in Texas in May 2023 allowing employee financially based incentives to be recovered. 
 A 20 million increase in employee-related expenses due to the voluntary severance program. 
 Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased 17 million primarily due to a higher depreciable base. 
 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes decreased 12 million primarily due to lower property taxes driven by decreased tax rates. 
 Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction increased 15 million primarily due to a higher AFUDC base. 
 Interest Expense increased 15 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 21 million increase due to higher debt balances and interest rates. 
 This increase was partially offset by: 
 A 6 million decrease due to an increase of capitalization of AFUDC on prepaid pension and OPEB. 
 Income Tax Expense increased 20 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 16 million increase due to an increase in pretax book income. 
 A 6 million increase due to a decrease in amortization of Excess ADIT.

 Third Quarter of 2024 Compared to Third Quarter of 2023 
 
 The major components of the decrease in Revenues were as follows: 
 
 Retail Revenues decreased 27 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 13 million decrease in fuel revenue. 
 A 12 million decrease in weather-normalized margins primarily in the residential and industrial classes. 
 A 10 million decrease in weather-related usage primarily due to a 7 decrease in cooling degree days. 
 These decreases were partially offset by: 
 An 8 million increase primarily due to formula rate increases in Arkansas. 
 Transmission Revenues increased 7 million primarily due to an increase in transmission investment. 
 
 Expenses and Other and Income Tax Benefit changed between years as follows: 
 
 Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expenses decreased 11 million primarily due to a current year decrease in amortization of under-recovered fuel regulatory assets. 
 Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased 17 million primarily due to an increase in amortization of regulatory assets and a higher depreciable base. 
 100 

Interest Expense decreased 10 million primarily due to the following: 
 An 8 million decrease due to the prior year amortization of carrying charges on storm-related regulatory assets. 
 A 3 million decrease due to the recognition of debt carrying charges as a result of the IRS PLR received regarding the treatment of stand-alone NOLCs in retail rate making. 
 Income Tax Benefit decreased 11 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 5 million decrease due to a decrease in PTCs. 
 A 4 million decrease due to a decrease in amortization of Excess ADIT. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The major components of the decrease in Revenues were as follows: 
 
 Retail Revenues decreased 176 million primarily due to the recognition of a 160 million probable revenue refund associated with the Turk Plant and SWEPCo s 2012 Texas Base Rate Case. 
 Transmission Revenues increased 10 million primarily due to a 15 million increase in continued investment in transmission assets and load, partially offset by a 4 million reversal of a prior period provision for refund in 2023. 
 Other Revenues increased 5 million primarily due to associated business development revenues driven by costs associated with a third-party construction project. 
 
 Expenses and Other and Income Tax Benefit changed between years as follows: 
 
 Purchased Electricity, Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation expenses decreased 33 million primarily due to a current year decrease in amortization of under-recovered fuel regulatory assets. 
 Other Operation and Maintenance expenses increased 48 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 17 million increase in employee-related expenses primarily due to the voluntary severance program. 
 A 14 million increase due to a disallowance recorded on the remaining net book value of the Dolet Hills Power Station as a result of an LPSC approved settlement agreement in April 2024. 
 An 11 million increase in SPP transmission expenses. 
 A 5 million increase due to the prior year capitalization of previously expensed renewable generation pre-construction charges. 
 Depreciation and Amortization expenses increased 31 million primarily due to an increase in amortization of regulatory assets and a higher depreciable base, partially offset by the recognition of a regulatory asset related to NOLCs. 
 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes decreased 11 million primarily due to a decrease in property taxes. 
 Interest Expense decreased 32 million primarily due to the decrease in the recognition of debt carrying charges as a result of the IRS PLR received regarding the treatment of stand-alone NOLCs in retail rate making. 
 Income Tax Benefit increased 163 million primarily due to the following: 
 A 109 million increase due to a reduction in Excess ADIT regulatory liabilities as a result of the IRS PLR received regarding the treatment of stand-alone NOLCs in retail rate making. 
 A 34 million increase due to a decrease in pretax book income. 
 A 32 million increase due to the reversal of a regulatory liability related to the merchant portion of Turk Plant Excess ADIT as a result of the APSC's March 2024 denial of SWEPCo's request to allow the merchant portion of the Turk Plant to serve Arkansas customers.

 million in 2021. See the 2020 Texas Base Rate Case section below for additional information. As part of the 2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case, the APSC authorized recovery of SWEPCo s Arkansas jurisdictional share of the Dolet Hills Power Station through 2027, but denied SWEPCo the ability to earn a return on this investment resulting in a disallowance of million in the second quarter of 2022. Also, the APSC did not rule on the prudency of the early retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station, which will be addressed in a future proceeding. As part of the 2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case, the LPSC authorized the recovery of SWEPCo s Louisiana share of the Dolet Hills Power Station, through a separate rider, through 2032, but did not rule on the prudency of the early retirement of the plant, which is being addressed in a separate proceeding. In April 2024, the LPSC approved a unanimous settlement agreement filed by SWEPCo, LPSC staff and certain intervenors that resolved the prudency of the retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station and resulted in a disallowance of million in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 In March 2023, the Pirkey Plant was retired. As part of the 2020 Louisiana Base Rate Case, the LPSC authorized the recovery of SWEPCo s Louisiana jurisdictional share of the Pirkey Plant, through a separate rider, through 2032. As part of the 2021 Arkansas Base Rate Case, the APSC granted SWEPCo regulatory asset treatment. SWEPCo will request recovery including a weighted average cost of capital carrying charge through a future proceeding. In July 2023, Texas ALJs issued a PFD that concluded the decision to retire the Pirkey Plant was prudent. In September 2023, the PUCT rejected the ALJs July 2023 PFD. In the open meeting, the commissioners expressed their concerns that the analysis in support of SWEPCo s decision to retire the Pirkey Plant was not robust enough and that SWEPCo should have re-evaluated the decision following Winter Storm Uri. The treatment of the cost of recovery of the Pirkey Plant is expected to be addressed in a future rate case. As of September 30, 2024, the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of the Pirkey Plant was million. To the extent any portion of the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of the Pirkey Plant is not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

Dolet Hills Power Station and Related Fuel Operations (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo) 
 
 In December 2021, the Dolet Hills Power Station was retired. While in operation, DHLC provided 100 of the fuel supply to Dolet Hills Power Station. The remaining book value of Dolet Hills Power Station non-fuel related assets are recoverable by SWEPCo through rate riders. As of September 30, 2024, SWEPCo s share of the net investment in the Dolet Hills Power Station was million, including materials and supplies, net of cost of removal collected in rates. Fuel costs incurred by the Dolet Hills Power Station are recoverable by SWEPCo through active fuel clauses and are subject to prudency determinations by the various commissions. After closure of the DHLC mining operations and the Dolet Hills Power Station, additional reclamation and other land-related costs incurred by DHLC and Oxbow will continue to be billed to SWEPCo and included in existing fuel clauses. As of September 30, 2024, SWEPCo had a net under-recovered fuel balance of million, inclusive of costs related to the Dolet Hills Power Station billed by DHLC, but excluding impacts of the February 2021 severe winter weather event. 
 
 In March 2021, the LPSC issued an order allowing SWEPCo to recover up to million of fuel costs in 2021 and defer approximately million of additional costs with a recovery period to be determined at a later date. In August 2022, the LPSC staff filed testimony recommending fuel disallowances of up to million, including denial of recovery of the million deferral, with refunds to customers over five years. In February 2024, an ALJ issued a final recommendation which included a proposed million refund to customers and the denial of recovery of the million deferral. SWEPCo filed a motion to present oral arguments with the LPSC to dispute the ALJ s recommendations. In April 2024, the LPSC approved a unanimous settlement agreement filed by SWEPCo, LPSC staff and certain intervenors that resolved the fuel recovery dispute and resulted in a fuel disallowance of million. The remaining million regulatory asset balance will be recovered over three years with interest. 
 
 In March 2021, the APSC approved fuel rates that provide recovery of million for the Arkansas share of the 2021 Dolet Hills Power Station fuel costs over five years through the existing fuel clause. 
 
 In September 2023, the PUCT approved an unopposed settlement agreement that provides recovery of million of Oxbow mine related costs through 2035. 
 
 If any of these costs are not recoverable or customer refunds are required, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

million, including materials and supplies, net of cost of removal. See the Regulated Generating Units that have been Retired section above for additional information. Fuel costs are recovered through active fuel clauses and are subject to prudency determinations by the various commissions. As of March 31, 2023, SWEPCo fuel deliveries, including billings of all fixed costs, from Sabine ceased. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, SWEPCo had a net under-recovered fuel balance of million, inclusive of costs related to the Pirkey Plant billed by Sabine, but excluding impacts of the February 2021 severe winter weather event. Remaining operational, reclamation and other land-related costs incurred by Sabine will be billed to SWEPCo and included in existing fuel clauses. 
 
 In July 2023, the LPSC ordered that a separate proceeding be established to review the prudence of the decision to retire the Pirkey Plant, including the costs included in fuel for years starting in 2019 and after. The LPSC established a procedural schedule stating staff and intervenor testimony is due in November 2024 and a hearing is scheduled for March 2025. 
 
 In September 2023, the PUCT approved an unopposed settlement agreement that provides recovery of million of Sabine related fuel costs through 2035. 
 
 If any of these costs are not recoverable or customer refunds are required, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

million annual base rate increase over its adjusted test year revenues which include interim transmission and distribution rate updates. AEP Texas s request is based upon a proposed ROE with a capital structure of debt and common equity. The rate case seeks a prudence determination on all capital additions placed in service during the period January 1, 2019 through September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, AEP Texas cumulative revenues from transmission and distribution interim rate increases are estimated to be approximately billion and are subject to reconciliation in this base rate case. In July 2024, AEP Texas filed an unopposed settlement agreement with the PUCT. The settlement agreement included a proposed annual revenue increase of million based upon a ROE with a capital structure of debt and common equity. In addition, the settlement agreement approved the prudency of capital investments placed in service for the period January 1, 2019 through September 30, 2023 and the associated interim revenues collected on those capital investments. In October 2024, the PUCT issued a final order approving the settlement agreement without modification. 
 
 APCo and WPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and APCo) 
 
 ENEC (Expanded Net Energy Cost) Filings 
 
 In January 2024, the WVPSC issued an order resolving APCo s and WPCo s (the Companies) 2021-2023 ENEC cases. In the order, the WVPSC: (a) disallowed million in ENEC under-recovered costs as of February 28, 2023 million related to APCo) and (b) approved the recovery of million of ENEC under-recovered costs as of February 28, 2023 million related to APCo) plus a debt carrying charge rate over a ten-year recovery period starting September 1, 2024. In February 2024, the Companies filed briefs with the West Virginia Supreme Court to initiate an appeal of this order. In September 2024, oral arguments were held at the West Virginia Supreme Court. A final ruling is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 In April 2024, the Companies submitted their annual ENEC update filing with the WVPSC proposing a million annual increase in ENEC rates when compared to existing ENEC rates. The Companies proposed that this ENEC rate change would: (a) become effective September 1, 2024, (b) include a million annual increase in ENEC rates related to the period ending February 29, 2024 and the forecast period September 2024 through August 2025 and (c) include a million annual increase in ENEC rates for the recovery of million of ENEC under-recovered costs as of February 28, 2023 over a ten-year period, plus a debt carrying charge rate. In July 2024, intervenors and staff filed testimony with the WVPSC, which did not recommend any disallowances. 
 
 In August 2024, the WVPSC issued an order approving the requested million annual increase effective September 1, 2024. The WVPSC will address the proposed additional million annual increase in ENEC rates in a future order. If any costs included in the future filing are not approved for recovery, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 Virginia Fuel Adjustment Clause (FAC) Review 
 
 In 2023, APCo submitted its annual fuel cost filing with the Virginia SCC. Interim Virginia FAC rates were implemented in November 2023. In APCo's 2022 Virginia fuel update filing, the Virginia staff ordered the Virginia Staff to commence an audit of APCo s fuel costs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. The Virginia staff analyzed APCo s 2019 through 2022 fuel procurement activities and concluded the procurement practices were reasonable and prudent and recommended no disallowances. In May 2024, the Virginia SCC issued an order approving the audit of APCo s 2019 and 2020 fuel costs but concluded that the review of APCo fuel costs for 2021 and 2022 remains open for further evaluation. As of September 30, 2024, APCo had a Virginia jurisdictional under-recovered fuel balance of million. If any fuel costs are not recoverable or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 2024 Virginia Base Rate Case 
 
 In March 2024, APCo filed a request with the Virginia SCC for a million annual increase in base rates based upon a proposed ROE and a proposed capital structure of debt and common equity. The requested increase in base rates is primarily due to incremental rate base, proposed capital structure changes including an increase in ROE and proposed increases in distribution and generation operation and maintenance expenses. In September 2024, a hearing was held where APCo updated its requested increase in base rates to million consistent with its rebuttal positions or, alternatively, an increase of million if annual environmental compliance consumable expenses are moved from base rates to recovery through APCo s environmental rate adjustment clause. An order will be issued in the fourth quarter of 2024. If any costs included in this filing are not approved for recovery, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 120 

million annual increase in base rates based upon a proposed ROE and a proposed capital structure of debt and common equity. The requested net annual increase in base rates excludes the Companies proposed million annual Modified Rate Base Cost (MRBC) surcharge update proposed to be effective in a separate proceeding and the existing million annual Mitchell Base Rate Surcharge that are both proposed to be rolled into base rates upon the Companies anticipated 2025 change in base rates. The Companies proposed base rate increase includes recovery of approximately million in previously deferred major storm expense over a three-year period, capital structure changes including an increase in ROE, an increase in depreciation expense related to proposed changes in depreciation rates and increased capital investments and increases in distribution and generation operation and maintenance expenses. 
 
 The Companies November 2024 West Virginia base rate filing also included two sets of alternative frameworks to simplify rates and customer bills and provide predictable future rate increases. The Companies first framework includes: (a) securitization, (b) approval of a major storm expense recovery and tracking mechanism and (c) freezing of OATT revenues in the ENEC. This framework includes securitization in a concurrent proceeding of approximately billion of West Virginia jurisdictional assets including: (a) the Companies remaining combined unrecovered ENEC balance related to costs incurred through February 28, 2023, (b) undepreciated West Virginia jurisdictional plant balances as of December 31, 2022 for the Amos, Mitchell and Mountaineer Plants, (c) environmental costs previously approved for recovery through a separate West Virginia surcharge and (d) deferred major storm operation and maintenance costs. Securitization of those items could reduce the Companies combined requested increase in annual base rates to million. 
 
 The Companies also included an alternative ratemaking proposal that includes: (a) a separate surcharge that would allow the Companies up to a annual increase in overall West Virginia rates for four consecutive years on April 1 st of each year after the implementation of base rates in this case, (b) the elimination of all of the Companies existing West Virginia jurisdictional surcharges except for the ENEC, with the revenues of these eliminated riders rolled into base rates and (c) the creation of a new West Virginia jurisdictional environmental and new generation surcharge. This alternative proposal would allow the Companies to submit a base rate case filing in advance of and in lieu of the annual April 1st increase and would require the Companies to submit a base rate case filing at the end of the proposed four-year period. 
 
 If any costs included in this filing are not approved for recovery, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 West Virginia Modified Rate Base Cost (MRBC) Surcharge Update Filing 
 
 In March 2024, APCo and WPCo (the Companies) submitted an annual MRBC surcharge update filing with the WVPSC requesting a million annual increase in the Companies combined MRBC rates. The MRBC is an infrastructure investment tracker that allows limited cost recovery related to capital investments between the Companies West Virginia jurisdictional base rate cases. WVPSC staff and an intervening party recommended revenue requirement disallowances in written and verbal testimony and briefs for certain ratemaking issues used to develop the Companies proposed MRBC rates, including the West Virginia jurisdictional effect of state deferred income taxes, NOLC and AROs. If any refund liabilities are imposed by the WVPSC, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 Hurricane Helene 
 
 In late September 2024, the remnants of Hurricane Helene significantly impacted APCo s Virginia and West Virginia service territories leading to approximately customer outages and damages to APCo s power grid. Storm restoration efforts continued into early October and APCo completed restoration efforts for all customers who lost power by October 6th, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, APCo incurred approximately million million related to the Virginia jurisdiction and million related to the West Virginia jurisdiction) of incremental other operation and maintenance expenses and approximately million of capital expenditures. APCo deferred million of the incremental other operation and maintenance expenses as regulatory assets as the costs are deemed probable of future recovery. Based on the information currently available, APCo estimates total storm restoration costs to be approximately million, of which is expected to be deferred as regulatory assets and the remaining of the costs are expected to be capital expenditures. If any costs related to Hurricane Helene are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 

121 

equity ownership interest in ETT. Predominantly all of ETT s revenues are based on interim rate changes that can be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next base rate proceeding. Through September 30, 2024, AEP s share of ETT s cumulative revenues that are subject to a prudency review is approximately billion. A base rate review could produce a refund to customers if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an interim increase was based. A revenue decrease, including a refund of interim transmission rates, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses, if any, that are reasonably possible of occurring. ETT is required to file for a comprehensive rate review no later than February 1, 2025, during which the billion of cumulative revenues above will be subject to review. 
 
 I M Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and I M) 
 
 2023 Michigan Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR) Reconciliation 
 
 In March 2024, I M submitted its 2023 PSCR Reconciliation to the MPSC. In October 2024, MPSC staff and intervenors submitted testimony recommending PSCR cost disallowances associated with the OVEC Inter-Company Power Agreement and the Rockport UPA with AEGCo ranging from million to million. A hearing is scheduled for December 2024. If any PSCR costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 2023 Indiana Base Rate Case 
 
 In August 2023, I M filed a request with the IURC for a million annual increase in Indiana base rates based upon a 2024 forecasted test year, a proposed ROE and a proposed capital structure of debt and common equity. I M proposed that the annual increase in base rates be implemented in two steps, with the first increase effective in mid-2024, following an IURC order, and the second increase effective in January 2025. The proposed annual increase includes, but is not limited to, a million increase related to depreciation expense, driven by increased depreciation rates and increased capital investments, and a million increase related to storm expenses. I M s Indiana base case filing requested recovery of certain historical period regulatory asset balances and proposed deferral accounting for certain future investments and tax related issues, including CAMT expense and PTCs related to the Cook Plant. 
 
 In December 2023, I M and intervenors reached a settlement agreement that was submitted to the IURC recommending a two-step increase in Indiana rates with a million annual increase effective upon an IURC order and the remaining million annual increase effective in January 2025 subject to I M s level of electric plant in service as of December 31, 2024 in comparison to I M s 2024 forecasted test year. The recommended revenue increase includes: (a) a ROE, (b) a two-step update of I M s Indiana capital structure with a capital structure of for both debt and common equity effective upon an IURC order and a January 2025 update based on I M s actual capital structure as of December 31, 2024 with common equity not to exceed , (c) a million increase related to depreciation expense and (d) an million increase related to storm expenses. In addition, I M also agreed to withdraw its proposal to defer CAMT and Cook Plant PTCs and to instead include the Indiana jurisdictional impact of Cook Plant PTCs in I M s Indiana earnings test evaluations. See Indiana Earnings Test below for additional information. 
 
 In May 2024, the IURC issued an order approving the settlement agreement with minor modifications. 
 
 2023 Michigan Base Rate Case 
 
 In September 2023, I M filed a request with the MPSC for a million annual increase in Michigan base rates based upon a 2024 forecasted test year, a proposed ROE and a capital structure of debt and common equity. The proposed annual increase includes an million annual increase in depreciation expense driven by increased capital investment. I M s Michigan base case filing requests recovery of certain historical period regulatory asset balances and proposes deferral accounting for certain future investments and tax related issues, including CAMT expense and PTCs related to the Cook Plant. 
 
 In July 2024, the MPSC issued a final order approving an annual base rate increase of million based on a ROE and a capital structure of debt and common equity. The MPSC also ordered that Michigan jurisdictional Cook Plant PTCs will be reflected as a deferral in I M s PSCR reconciliation and rejected I M s request to defer Michigan jurisdictional CAMT. 

122 

million net annual increase in base rates based upon a proposed ROE with the increase to be implemented no earlier than January 2024. In conjunction with its June 2023 filing, KPCo further requested to finance through the issuance of securitization bonds, approximately million of regulatory assets. KPCo s proposal did not address the disposition of its interest in Mitchell Plant, which will be addressed in the future. As of September 30, 2024, the net book value of KPCo s share of the Mitchell Plant, before cost of removal including CWIP and inventory, was million. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 In November 2023, KPCo filed an uncontested settlement agreement with the KPSC, that included an annual base rate increase of million, based upon a ROE. Settlement parties agreed that the KPSC should approve KPCo s securitization request, and that the approximately million regulatory assets requested for securitization are comprised of prudently incurred costs. 
 
 In January 2024, the KPSC issued an order modifying the November 2023 uncontested settlement agreement and approving an annual base rate increase of million based upon a ROE effective with billing cycles mid-January 2024. The order reduced KPCo s base rate revenue requirement by million to allow recovery of actual test year PJM transmission costs instead of KPCo s requested annual level of costs based on PJM 2023 projected transmission revenue requirements. In February 2024, KPCo filed an appeal with the Commonwealth of Kentucky Franklin Circuit Court, challenging among other aspects of the order, the million base rate revenue requirement reduction. 
 
 In January 2024, consistent with the November 2023 uncontested settlement agreement, the KPSC issued a financing order approving KPCo s request to securitize certain regulatory assets balances as of the time securitization bonds are issued and concluding that costs requested for recovery through securitization were prudently incurred. The KPSC s financing order includes certain additional requirements related to securitization bond structuring, marketing, placement and issuance that were not reflected in KPCo s proposal. In accordance with Kentucky statutory requirements and the financing order, the issuance of the securitized bonds is subject to final review by the KPSC after bond pricing. KPCo expects to proceed with the securitized bond issuance process and to complete the securitization process in the first half of 2025, subject to market conditions. As of September 30, 2024, regulatory asset balances expected to be recovered through securitization total million and include: (a) million of plant retirement costs, (b) million of deferred storm costs related to 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 major storms, (c) million of deferred purchased power expenses, (d) million of under-recovered purchased power rider costs and (e) million of deferred issuance-related expenses, including KPSC advisor expenses. If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 123 

million to million of its total million purchased power cost recoveries as a result of proposed modifications to the ratemaking methodology that limits purchased power costs recoverable through the FAC. A hearing was held in February 2024 and the KPSC may issue its order in the fourth quarter of 2024 or early 2025. If any fuel costs are not recoverable or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 Rockport Offset Recovery 
 
 In January 2024, KPCo filed an application with the KPSC seeking to recover an allowed cost (Rockport Offset) of million in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement in the 2017 Kentucky Base Rate Case permitting KPCo to use the level of non-fuel, non-environmental Rockport Plant UPA expense included in base rates to earn its authorized ROE in 2023 since the Rockport UPA ended in December 2022. An estimated Rockport Offset of million was recovered through a rider, subject to true-up, during the 12-months ended December 2023. In February 2024, the KPSC issued an order allowing KPCo to collect the remaining million through interim rates, subject to refund, over twelve months starting in March 2024. In April 2024, KPCo submitted to the KPSC a request for decision on the record. In August 2024, KPCo filed an application with the KPSC to extend the recovery of the remaining balance through September 2025. The KPSC may issue its order in the fourth quarter of 2024 or early 2025. Through the third quarter of 2024, the Rockport Offset true-up is reflected in revenues to the extent amounts have been billed to customers, as KPCo has not met the requirements of alternative revenue recognition in accordance with the accounting guidance for Regulated Operations . If the Rockport Offset is not recoverable or refunds are ordered, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 OPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and OPCo) 
 
 OVEC Cost Recovery Audits 
 
 In December 2021, as part of OVEC cost recovery audits pending before the PUCO, intervenors filed positions claiming that costs incurred by OPCo during the 2018-2019 audit period were imprudent and should be disallowed. In May 2022, intervenors filed for rehearing on the 2016-2017 OVEC cost recovery audit period claiming the PUCO s April 2022 order to adopt the findings of the audit report were unjust, unlawful and unreasonable for multiple reasons, including the position that OPCo recovered imprudently incurred costs. In May 2023, as part of the OVEC cost recovery audits pending before the PUCO, intervenors filed positions claiming that costs incurred by OPCo during the 2020 audit period were imprudent and should be disallowed. 
 
 In August 2024, the PUCO issued orders pertaining to the OVEC cost recovery audits that: (a) denied intervenors application for rehearing on the 2016-2017 audit period, (b) determined costs incurred by OPCo during the 2018-2019 audit period were prudent, (c) determined costs incurred by OPCo during the 2020 audit period were prudent and (d) recommended no disallowances for any mentioned audit period in question. In September 2024, intervenors filed for rehearing on the 2018-2019 and 2020 OVEC cost recovery audit periods claiming the PUCO s August 2024 orders to adopt the findings of the audit reports were unjust, unlawful and unreasonable for multiple reasons, including the position that OPCo recovered imprudently incurred costs. In October 2024, the PUCO denied the intervenors applications for rehearing of the 2018-2019 and 2020 audit periods. 
 
 Ohio ESP Filings 
 
 In January 2023, OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve an ESP that included proposed rate adjustments, proposed new riders and the continuation and modification of certain existing riders, including the DIR, effective June 2024 through May 2030. The proposal includes a return on common equity of on capital costs for certain riders. In June 2023, intervenors filed testimony opposing OPCo s plan for various new riders and modifications to existing riders, including the DIR. In September 2023, OPCo and certain intervenors filed a settlement agreement with the PUCO addressing the ESP application. The settlement included a four year term from June 2024 through May 2028, an ROE of and continuation of a number of riders including the DIR subject to revenue caps. In April 2024, the PUCO issued an order approving the settlement agreement. In May 2024, intervenors filed an application for rehearing with the PUCO on the approved settlement agreement and the PUCO denied the intervenors application for rehearing in June 2024. 

124 

million annual base rate increase based upon a ROE with a capital structure of debt and common equity. PSO requested an expanded transmission cost recovery rider and a mechanism to recover generation costs necessary to comply with SPP s 2023 increased capacity planning reserve margin requirements. PSO s request includes the MW Rock Falls Wind Facility and reflects recovery of Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 through 2040. 
 
 In July 2024, OCC staff and various intervenors filed testimony. The OCC staff recommended a million annual base rate increase based upon a ROE while intervenors recommended an annual base rate increase ranging from million to million based on an ROE ranging from to . The OCC staff also recommended a million disallowance of certain capital investments. In addition, a certain intervenor recommended the OCC reject PSO s request to recover the Rock Falls Wind Facility through base rates, but allow PSO to retain PTCs and energy revenues up to the Rock Falls Wind Facility annual revenue requirement. In September 2024, the OCC staff withdrew its recommendation for a million disallowance of certain capital investments. 
 
 In October 2024, PSO, the OCC and certain intervenors filed a joint stipulation and settlement agreement with the OCC that included a net annual revenue increase of million based upon a ROE with a capital structure of debt and common equity. The agreement also allows for Rock Falls Wind Facility to be included in base rates and the deferral of certain generation-related costs necessary to comply with SPP s 2023 increased capacity reserve margin requirements. One intervenor opposed the joint stipulation and settlement agreement. In October 2024, a hearing was held at the OCC, and PSO implemented an interim annual base rate increase of million, subject to refund pending a final order by the OCC. An order is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 . If any costs included in this filing are not approved for recovery, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 SWEPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo) 
 
 2012 Texas Base Rate Case 
 
 In 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk Plant. In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo s recovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs. 
 
 Upon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap. As a result, SWEPCo reversed million of a previously recorded regulatory disallowance in 2013. In 2017, the Texas District Court upheld the PUCT s 2014 order and intervenors filed appeals with the Texas Third Court of Appeals. 
 
 In August 2021, the Texas Third Court of Appeals reversed the Texas District Court judgment affirming the PUCT s order on AFUDC, concluding that the language of the PUCT s original 2008 order intended to include AFUDC in the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap and remanded the case to the PUCT for future proceedings. In November 2021, SWEPCo and the PUCT submitted Petitions for Review with the Texas Supreme Court. In October 2022, the Texas Supreme Court denied the Petitions for Review submitted by SWEPCo and the PUCT. In December 2022, SWEPCo and the PUCT filed requests for rehearing with the Texas Supreme Court. In June 2023, the Texas Supreme Court denied SWEPCo s request for rehearing and the case was remanded to the PUCT for future proceedings. In October 2023, SWEPCo filed testimony with the PUCT in the remanded proceeding recommending no refund or disallowance. 
 
 In December 2023, the PUCT approved a preliminary order stating the PUCT will not address SWEPCo s request that would allow the PUCT to find cause to allow SWEPCo to exceed the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap in the current remand proceeding. As a result of the PUCT s approval of the preliminary order, SWEPCo recorded a pretax, non-cash disallowance of million in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 The PUCT s December 2023 approval of the preliminary order determined that it will address, in the ongoing PUCT remand proceeding, any potential revenue refunds to customers that may be required by future PUCT orders. On March 1, 2024, SWEPCo filed supplemental direct testimony with the PUCT in response to the December 2023 preliminary order. On March 8, 2024, intervenors and the PUCT staff filed a motion with the PUCT to strike portions of SWEPCo s October 2023 direct testimony and March 2024 supplemental direct testimony. On March 19, 2024, the ALJ granted portions of the motion, which included removal of testimony supporting SWEPCo s position that refunds were not appropriate. On March 28, 2024, 
 125 

million to million, including carrying charges, with refund periods ranging from months to months. In May 2024, the PUCT denied SWEPCo s appeal of the ALJ s March 2024 decision. In the second quarter of 2024, based on the PUCT s decision, SWEPCo recorded a one-time, probable revenue refund provision of million, including interest, associated with revenue collected from February 2013 through December 2023. In June 2024, SWEPCo and parties to the remand proceeding reached an agreement in principle that would resolve all issues in the case. In October 2024, SWEPCo filed the settlement agreement with the PUCT. Under the settlement agreement, SWEPCo will refund over a two-year period million, including interest, associated with revenue collected from February 2013 through December 2023 and remove AFUDC in excess of the Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap from rate base. The settlement is expected to be considered by the PUCT in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 2016 Texas Base Rate Case 
 
 In 2016, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for a net increase in Texas annual revenues of million based upon a ROE. In January 2018, the PUCT issued a final order approving a net increase in Texas annual revenues of million based upon a ROE, effective May 2017. The final order also included: (a) approval to recover the Texas jurisdictional share of environmental investments placed in-service, as of June 30, 2016, at various plants, including Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3, (b) approval of recovery of, but no return on, the Texas jurisdictional share of the net book value of Welsh Plant, Unit 2, (c) approval of million in additional vegetation management expenses and (d) the rejection of SWEPCo s proposed transmission cost recovery mechanism. 
 
 As a result of the final order, in 2017 SWEPCo: (a) recorded an impairment charge of million, which included million associated with the lack of return on Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and million related to other disallowed plant investments, (b) recognized million of additional revenues, for the period of May 2017 through December 2017, that was surcharged to customers in 2018 and (c) recognized an additional million of expenses consisting primarily of depreciation expense and vegetation management expense, offset by the deferral of rate case expense. SWEPCo implemented new rates in February 2018 billings. The million of additional 2017 revenues was collected during 2018. In March 2018, the PUCT clarified and corrected portions of the final order, without changing the overall decision or amounts of the rate change. The order has been appealed by various intervenors related to limiting SWEPCo s recovery of AFUDC on Turk Plant and recovery of Welsh Plant, Unit 2. If certain parts of the PUCT order are overturned, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 2020 Texas Base Rate Case 
 
 In October 2020, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for a million annual increase in Texas base rates based upon a proposed ROE. The request would move transmission and distribution interim revenues recovered through riders into base rates. Eliminating these riders would result in a net annual requested base rate increase of million primarily due to increased investments. SWEPCo subsequently filed a request with the PUCT lowering the requested annual increase in Texas base rates to million, which would result in an million net annual base rate increase after moving the proposed riders to rate base. 
 
 In January 2022, the PUCT issued a final order approving an annual revenue increase of million based upon a ROE. The order also includes: (a) rates implemented retroactively back to March 18, 2021, (b) million of the proposed increase related to vegetation management, (c) million annually to establish a storm catastrophe reserve and (d) the creation of a rider to recover the Dolet Hills Power Station as if it were in rate base until its retirement at the end of 2021 and starting in 2022 the remaining net book value to be recovered as a regulatory asset through 2046. As a result of the final order, SWEPCo recorded a disallowance of million in 2021 associated with the lack of return on the Dolet Hills Power Station. In February 2022, SWEPCo filed a motion for rehearing with the PUCT challenging several errors in the order, which include challenges of the approved ROE, the denial of a reasonable return or carrying costs on the Dolet Hills Power Station and the calculation of the Texas jurisdictional share of the storm catastrophe reserve. In April 2022, the PUCT denied the motion for rehearing. In May 2022, SWEPCo filed a petition for review with the Texas District Court seeking judicial review of the several errors challenged in the PUCT s final order. 
 
 2021 Louisiana Storm Cost Filing 
 
 In 2020, Hurricanes Laura and Delta caused power outages and extensive damage to the SWEPCo service territories, primarily impacting the Louisiana jurisdiction. Following both hurricanes, the LPSC issued orders allowing Louisiana utilities, including SWEPCo, to establish regulatory assets to track and defer expenses associated with these storms. In February 2021, severe winter weather impacted the Louisiana jurisdiction and in March 2021, the LPSC approved the deferral of incremental storm restoration expenses related to the winter storm. In March 2023, SWEPCo and the LPSC staff filed a joint stipulation and settlement agreement with the LPSC, which confirmed the prudency of million of deferred incremental storm restoration 
 126 

through March 2024. In April 2023, the LPSC issued an order approving the stipulation and settlement agreement. In July 2023, SWEPCo submitted additional information in phase two of this proceeding to obtain a financing order and prudency review of capital investment. In April 2024, SWEPCo and the LPSC staff filed a joint uncontested stipulation and settlement agreement with the LPSC requesting securitization of storm costs, including a storm reserve. In July 2024, the LPSC issued an order approving the joint uncontested stipulation and settlement agreement, including approval to securitize million, which includes million for storm costs and a million storm reserve. Securitization bonds are expected to be issued in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to market conditions. 
 
 February 2021 Severe Winter Weather Impacts in SPP 
 
 In February 2021, severe winter weather had a significant impact in SPP, resulting in significantly increased market prices for natural gas power plants to meet reliability needs for the SPP electric system. For the time period of February 9, 2021 to February 20, 2021, SWEPCo s natural gas expenses and purchases of electricity still to be recovered from customers are shown in the table below: 
 years (a) Louisiana (b) (b) Texas years Total 
 
 (a) SWEPCo is permitted to record carrying costs on the unrecovered balance of fuel costs at a weighted-cost of capital approved by the APSC. In August 2024, the APSC issued an order that found SWEPCo had prudently incurred these costs. 
 (b) In March 2021, the LPSC approved a special order granting a temporary modification to the FAC and shortly after SWEPCo began recovery of its Louisiana jurisdictional share of these fuel costs based on a five-year recovery period inclusive of an interim carrying charge equal to the prime rate. The special order states the fuel and purchased power costs incurred will be subject to a future LPSC audit. 
 
 If SWEPCo is unable to recover any of the costs relating to the extraordinary fuel and purchases of electricity, or obtain authorization of a reasonable carrying charge on these costs, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 PSO and SWEPCo Rate Matters (Applies to AEP, PSO and SWEPCo) 
 
 North Central Wind Energy Facilities 
 
 The NCWF are subject to various regulatory performance requirements, including a Net Capacity Factor (NCF) guarantee. The NCF guarantee will be measured in MWhs across all facilities on a combined basis for each five year period for the first thirty full years of operation. The first NCF guarantee five year period began in April 2022. Certain wind turbines have experienced performance issues related to defects covered by the manufacturer s warranty. These performance issues have prompted PSO and SWEPCo to file a lawsuit against the manufacturer in an attempt to find a resolution on the matter. If regulatory performance requirements, such as the NCF guarantee, are not met, PSO and SWEPCo may recognize a regulatory liability to refund retail customers. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring. 
 
 FERC Rate Matters 
 
 Independence Energy Connection Project (Applies to AEP) 
 
 In 2016, PJM approved the Independence Energy Connection Project (IEC) and included it in its Regional Transmission Expansion Plan to alleviate congestion. Transource Energy has an ownership interest in the IEC, which is located in Maryland and Pennsylvania. In June 2020, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct the portion of the IEC in Maryland. In May 2021, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC) denied the IEC certificate for siting and construction of the portion in Pennsylvania. Transource Energy appealed the PAPUC ruling in Pennsylvania state court and challenged the ruling before the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In May 2022, the Pennsylvania state court issued an order affirming the PAPUC decision as to state law claims. In December 2023, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania granted summary judgment in favor of Transource Energy, finding that the PAPUC decision violated federal law and the United States Constitution. In January 2024, the PAPUC filed an appeal of the district court s grant of summary judgment with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Additional regulatory proceedings before the PAPUC are expected to resume in 2025.

million, located in Total Property, Plant and Equipment - Net on AEP s balance sheets. The FERC has previously granted abandonment benefits for this project, allowing the full recovery of prudently incurred costs if the project is cancelled for reasons outside the control of Transource Energy. If any of the IEC costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
 
 Request to Update AEGCo Depreciation Rates (Applies to AEP and I M) 
 
 In October 2022, AEP, on behalf of AEGCo, submitted proposed revisions to AEGCo s depreciation rates for its 50 ownership interest in Rockport Plant, Unit 1 and Unit 2, reflected in the UPA between AEGCo and I M. The proposed depreciation rates for these assets reflect an estimated 2028 retirement date for the Rockport Plant. AEGCo s previous FERC-approved depreciation rates for Rockport Plant, Unit 1 were based upon a December 31, 2028 estimated retirement date while AEGCo s previous FERC-approved depreciation rates for Rockport Plant, Unit 2 leasehold improvements were based upon a December 31, 2022 estimated retirement date in conjunction with the termination of the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease. 
 
 In December 2022, the FERC issued an order approving the proposed AEGCo Rockport depreciation rates effective January 1, 2023, subject to further review and a potential refund. In August 2023, AEGCo reached a settlement agreement with the FERC trial staff that resolved all issues set for hearing. In September 2023, the settlement agreement was certified to the FERC as uncontested. In March 2024, the FERC issued an order approving the uncontested settlement agreement. The results of the order did not have a material impact on financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 FERC 2021 PJM and SPP Transmission Formula Rate Challenge (Applies to AEP, AEPTCo, APCo, I M, PSO and SWEPCo) 
 
 The Registrants transitioned to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in its PJM and SPP transmission formula rates beginning with the 2022 projected transmission revenue requirements and 2021 true-up to actual transmission revenue requirements, and provided notice of this change in informational filings made with the FERC. Stand-alone treatment of the NOLCs for transmission formula rates increased the annual revenue requirements for years 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021 by million, million, million and million, respectively. 
 
 In January 2024, the FERC issued two orders granting formal challenges by certain unaffiliated customers related to stand-alone treatment of NOLCs in the 2021 Transmission Formula Rates of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP. The FERC directed the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP to provide refunds with interest on all amounts collected for the 2021 rate year, and for such refunds to be reflected in the annual update for the next rate year. Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2024, the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within SPP provided a portion of the 2021 rate year refunds, with the remainder of the refunds expected to be provided in 2025. The AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM are expected to provide their respective refunds for the 2021 rate year in 2025. In February 2024, AEPSC on behalf of the AEP transmission owning subsidiaries within PJM and SPP filed requests for rehearing. In March 2024, the FERC denied AEPSC s requests for rehearing of the January 2024 orders by operation of law and stated it may address the requests for rehearing in future orders. In March 2024, AEPSC submitted refund compliance reports to the FERC, which preserve the non-finality of the FERC s January 2024 orders pending further proceedings on rehearing and appeal. In April 2024, AEPSC made filings with the FERC which request that the FERC: (a) reopen the record so that the FERC may take the IRS PLRs received in April 2024 regarding the treatment of stand-alone NOLCs in ratemaking into evidence and consider them in substantive orders on rehearing and (b) stay its January 2024 orders and related compliance filings and refunds to provide time for consideration of the April 2024 IRS PLRs. In May 2024, AEPSC filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking review of the FERC s January 2024 and March 2024 decisions. In July 2024, the FERC issued orders approving AEPSC s request to reopen the record for the limited purpose of accepting into the record the IRS PLRs and establish additional briefing procedures. In August 2024, AEPSC filed briefs with the FERC requesting the commission modify or overturn their initial orders. 
 
 As a result of the January 2024 FERC orders, the Registrants balance sheets reflect a liability for the probable refund of all NOLC revenues included in transmission formula rates for years 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021, with interest. The Registrants have not yet been directed to make cash refunds related to the 2024, 2023 or 2022 rate years. The probable refunds to affiliated and nonaffiliated customers are reflected as Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the balance sheets, with the exception of amounts expected to be refunded within one year which are reflected in Other Current Liabilities. Refunds probable to be received by affiliated companies, resulting in a reduction to affiliated transmission expense, were deferred as an increase to Regulatory Liabilities or a reduction to Regulatory Assets on the balance sheets where management expects that refunds would be returned to retail customers through authorized retail jurisdiction rider mechanisms.

million for updated depreciation rates and allow for the return on and of FERC customers jurisdictional share of regulatory assets associated with retired plants. In November 2023, certain intervenors filed a motion with the FERC protesting and recommending the rejection of SWEPCo s filings. In December 2023, the FERC issued an order approving the proposed rates effective January 1, 2024, subject to further review and refund and established hearing and settlement proceedings. If SWEPCo is unable to recover the remaining regulatory assets associated with retired plants, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

 billion revolving credit facility to billion and extended the due date from March 2027 to March 2029. Also, in March 2024, AEP extended the due date of its billion revolving credit facility from March 2025 to March 2027. AEP may issue up to billion as letters of credit under these revolving credit facilities on behalf of subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, no letters of credit were issued under either revolving credit facility. 
 
 An uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility. AEP issues letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under six uncommitted facilities totaling million. The Registrants maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities as of September 30, 2024 were as follows:

 Indemnifications and Other Guarantees 
 
 Contracts 
 
 The Registrants enter into certain types of contracts which require indemnifications. Typically these contracts include, but are not limited to, sale agreements, lease agreements, purchase agreements and financing agreements. Generally, these agreements may include, but are not limited to, indemnifications around certain tax, contractual and environmental matters. With respect to sale agreements, exposure generally does not exceed the sale price. As of September 30, 2024, there were no material liabilities recorded for any indemnifications.

 ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo) 
 
 Federal EPA s Revised CCR Rule 
 
 In April 2024, the Federal EPA finalized revisions to the CCR Rule to expand the scope of the rule to include inactive impoundments at inactive facilities legacy CCR surface impoundments as well as to establish requirements for currently exempt solid waste management units that involve the direct placement of CCR on the land CCR management units ). The Federal EPA is requiring that owners and operators of legacy surface impoundments comply with all of the existing CCR Rule requirements applicable to inactive CCR surface impoundments at active facilities, except for the location restrictions and liner design criteria. The rule establishes compliance deadlines for legacy surface impoundments to meet regulatory requirements, including a requirement to initiate closure within five years after the effective date of the final rule. The rule requires evaluations to be completed at both active facilities and inactive facilities with one or more legacy surface impoundments. Closure may be accomplished by applying an impermeable cover system over the CCR material closure in place or the CCR material may be excavated and placed in a compliant landfill closure by removal ). Groundwater monitoring and other analysis over the next three years will provide additional information on the planned closure method. AEP evaluated the applicability of the rule to current and former plant sites and recorded incremental ARO in the second quarter of 2024, as shown in the table below, based on initial cost estimates primarily reflecting compliance with the rule through closure in place and future groundwater monitoring requirements pursuant to the CCR Rule.

A resolution of the investigation or claims may subject AEP to civil penalties in an amount that could differ from the amount recorded; however, management does not believe any such resolution would be material. 
 
 Claims for Indemnification Made by Owners of the Gavin Power Station (Applies to AEP) 
 
 In November 2022, the Federal EPA issued a final decision denying Gavin Power LLC s requested extension to allow a CCR surface impoundment at the Gavin Power Station to continue to receive CCR and non-CCR waste streams after April 11, 2021 until May 4, 2023 (the Gavin Denial). As part of the Gavin Denial, the Federal EPA made several assertions related to the CCR Rule (see Environmental Issues - CCR Rule section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information), including an assertion that the closure of the 300 acre unlined fly ash reservoir (FAR) is noncompliant with the CCR Rule in multiple respects. The Gavin Power Station was formerly owned and operated by AEP and was sold to Gavin Power LLC and Lightstone Generation LLC in 2017. Pursuant to the PSA, AEP maintained responsibility to complete closure of the FAR in accordance with the closure plan approved by the Ohio EPA which was completed in July 2021. The PSA contains indemnification provisions, pursuant to which the owners of the Gavin Power Station have notified AEP they believe they are entitled to indemnification for any damages that may result from these claims, including any future enforcement or litigation resulting from any determinations of noncompliance by the Federal EPA with various aspects of the CCR Rule consistent with the Gavin Denial. The owners of the Gavin Power Station have also sought indemnification for landowner claims for property damage allegedly caused by modifications to the FAR. Management does not believe that the owners of the Gavin Power Station have any valid claim for indemnity or otherwise against AEP under the PSA. In addition, Gavin Power LLC, several AEP subsidiaries, and other parties have filed Petitions for Review of the Gavin Denial with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which in June 2024, were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In January 2024, Gavin Power LLC also filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging various violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and asserting that the Federal EPA, through its prior inaction, has waived and is estopped from raising certain objections raised in the Gavin Denial. Management cannot predict the outcome of that litigation. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.

 Federal and State Income Tax Audit Status 
 
 The statute of limitations SOL for the IRS to examine AEP and subsidiaries originally filed federal return has expired for tax years 2016 and earlier. In July 2024, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation JCT completed its review of the results of the 2017-2020 IRS Audit and agreed to them. AEP received the associated tax refund and interest payment in September 2024. 
 
 This IRS audit and associated refund claim resulted from a net operating loss carryback to 2015 that originated in the 2017 return. AEP agreed to extend the SOL on the 2017-2020 tax returns to May 31, 2025, to allow the JCT adequate time to complete its review. However, AEP has IRS confirmation that tax years 2017-2020 are now effectively closed as they only remain open for changes to other non-consolidated entities that AEP holds an interest in. 
 
 AEP and subsidiaries file income tax returns in various state and local jurisdictions. These taxing authorities routinely examine the tax returns, and AEP and subsidiaries are currently under examination in several state and local jurisdictions. Generally, the SOL have expired for tax years prior to 2017. In addition, management is monitoring and continues to evaluate the potential impact of federal legislation and corresponding state conformity. 
 
 Federal Legislation 
 
 In August 2022, President Biden signed H.R. 5376 into law, commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA. Most notably this budget reconciliation legislation created a minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income (CAMT), extended and increased the value of PTCs and ITCs, added a nuclear and clean hydrogen PTC, an energy storage ITC and allowed the sale or transfer of tax credits to third-parties for cash. As further significant guidance from Treasury and the IRS is expected on the tax provisions in the IRA, AEP will continue to monitor any issued guidance and evaluate the impact on future net income, cash flows and financial condition.

million with million received in 2023, million received in the first quarter of 2024 and the remaining million was received in the second quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, AEP, on behalf of PSO, SWEPCo and APCo, entered into transferability agreements with nonaffiliated parties to sell 2024 generated PTCs which will result in approximately million of cash proceeds, of which approximately million was received in the third quarter of 2024 and the remaining million is expected to be received in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. AEP expects to continue to explore the ability to efficiently monetize its tax credits through third-party transferability agreements. 
 
 million of estimated Nuclear PTCs within their annualized ETR. Absent specific IRS guidance, AEP and I M s estimated 2024 Nuclear PTC was calculated using estimated 2024 gross receipts and forecasted annual generation for the Cook Plant. If, and when, IRS guidance is eventually issued, the value of the estimated Nuclear PTC will be updated to reflect such guidance, if necessary.

 Dividend Restrictions 
 
 Utility Subsidiaries Restrictions 
 
 Parent depends on its utility subsidiaries to pay dividends to shareholders. AEP utility subsidiaries pay dividends to Parent provided funds are legally available. Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends. 
 
 All of the dividends declared by AEP s utility subsidiaries that provide transmission or local distribution services are subject to a Federal Power Act requirement that prohibits the payment of dividends out of capital accounts in certain circumstances; payment of dividends is generally allowed out of retained earnings. The Federal Power Act also creates a reserve on earnings attributable to hydroelectric generation plants. Because of their ownership of such plants, this reserve applies to APCo and I M. 
 172 

. The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in the credit agreements. 
 The Federal Power Act restriction does not limit the ability of the AEP subsidiaries to pay dividends out of retained earnings. 
 
 Parent Restrictions (Applies to AEP) 
 
 The holders of AEP s common stock are entitled to receive the dividends declared by the Board of Directors provided funds are legally available for such dividends. Parent s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries. 
 
 Pursuant to the leverage restrictions in credit agreements, AEP must maintain a percentage of debt to total capitalization at a level that does not exceed . The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually-defined in the credit agreements. 
 
 Corporate Borrowing Program (Applies to all Registrant Subsidiaries) 
 
 AEP subsidiaries use a corporate borrowing program to meet their short-term borrowing needs. The corporate borrowing program includes a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP s utility subsidiaries; a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries; and direct borrowing from AEP. The AEP Utility Money Pool operates in accordance with the terms and conditions of its agreement filed with the FERC. The amounts of outstanding loans to (borrowings from) the Utility Money Pool as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are included in Advances to Affiliates and Advances from Affiliates, respectively, on the Registrant Subsidiaries balance sheets.

 of AEP s employees were eligible to participate in the program. Approximately employees chose to take the voluntary severance package and substantially all terminated employment in July 2024. The severance program provides two weeks of base pay for every year of service with a minimum of four weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks of base pay. Certain positions impacted by the voluntary severance program have been and will continue to be refilled to maintain safe, effective and efficient operations. Net savings from the program will help offset increasing operating expenses and high interest costs in order to keep electricity costs affordable for customers. 
 
 AEP recorded a charge to expense in the second quarter of 2024 related to this voluntary severance program. 
 
 Settled/Adjustments Remaining Balance as of September 30, 2024 

These expenses were primarily included in Other Operation and Maintenance on the statements of income and Other Current Liabilities on the balance sheets. The voluntary severance program has not triggered any material curtailment or settlement accounting considerations under the accounting guidance for Compensation - Retirement Benefits . 
 
 million is reached in the fourth quarter of 2024. In the event the settlement threshold is reached during 2024, settlement accounting would result in a plan remeasurement and approximately million to million of the net actuarial loss to be recognized in AEP s Statement of Income. If the settlement threshold is reached, AEP expects to seek recovery for the portion of the loss related to regulated operations.

 During the third quarter of 2024, management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each of the Registrants, evaluated the Registrants disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures of the Registrants that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Registrants management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 For a discussion of material legal proceedings, see Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, of Note 5 incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a detailed discussion of risk factors. As of September 30, 2024, the risk factors appearing in AEP s 2023 Annual Report are supplemented and updated as follows: 
 
 The occurrence of one or more wildfires could cause tremendous loss, impact the market value and credit ratings of our securities and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants) 
 
 More frequent and severe drought conditions, extreme swings in amount and timing of precipitation, changes in vegetation, unseasonably warm temperatures, very low humidity, stronger winds and other factors have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the potential impact of an event. AEP s infrastructure is aging and poses risks to safety and system reliability and wildfire mitigation initiatives may not be successful or effective in preventing or reducing wildfire-related events. Wildfires can occur even when effective mitigation procedures are followed. Despite AEP s wildfire mitigation initiatives, a wildfire could be ignited, spread and cause damages, which would subject AEP to significant liability. Other potential risks associated with wildfires include the inability to secure sufficient insurance coverage, uninsured losses or losses in excess of current insurance coverage, increased costs of insurance, regulatory recovery risk, litigation risk, and the potential for a credit downgrade and subsequent additional costs to access capital markets.

 WITNESSETH 
 
 WHEREAS, AEP has rightful possession of the aircraft listed in Appendix A, together with the engines and components installed thereon (the Aircraft ). The parties acknowledge that Appendix A may be modified from time to time as AEP aircraft are replaced and that updates of Appendix A do not require a full amendment to this Agreement and 
 
 WHEREAS, User desires use of the Aircraft on a limited basis and 
 
 WHEREAS, AEP desires to make the Aircraft available to User with flight crew on a non-exclusive time sharing basis in accordance with 91.501 of the Federal Aviation Regulations FARs and 
 
 WHEREAS, this Agreement sets forth the understanding of the parties as to the terms under which AEP will provide User with the use, on a non-exclusive time sharing basis, of the Aircraft.

User shall pay AEP the full amount of such invoice within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice. AEP may net the amount of such invoices from amounts payable from AEP to User including payroll or similar payments. In the event AEP has not received supplier invoices for reimbursable charges relating to such flight prior to such invoicing, AEP may issue supplemental invoice(s) for such charge(s) to User, and User shall pay such charge(s) within thirty (30) days of the date of each supplemental invoice.
