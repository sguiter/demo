SPECIAL NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including particularly statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy, prospective products and services, timing and likelihood of success, plans and objectives of management for future operations and future results of current and anticipated products and services. These statements involve uncertainties, such as known and unknown risks, and are dependent on other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from the future results, performance or achievements we express or imply. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, expect, plan, anticipate, could, intend, target, project, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described under the sections in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this Form 10-Q and in other documents we file from time to time with the SEC that disclose risks and uncertainties that may affect our business. The forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q do not reflect the potential impact of any divestiture, merger, acquisition, or other business combination that had not been completed as of the date of this filing. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond our control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 

of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ATD, which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 
 
 The Company serves the roadway intelligence sector, developing products and services to be used in advancing public safety, urban mobility, and transportation management. The Company's vision is to improve the lives of citizens and the world around them by enabling safer, smarter, and greener roadways and communities. The Company works towards this vision by collecting, connecting, and organizing mobility data, and making it accessible and useful to its customers. The Company's products and services provide data for resource and infrastructure planning and reporting, as well as real-time insights, predictive analytics and decisioning for situational awareness, rapid response and risk mitigation. 
 
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC for interim financial statements. Accordingly, they do not contain all information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes are unaudited. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 . 

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Dollar amounts, except per share data, in the notes to these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are rounded to the nearest 1,000. 

and a net loss of . 
 
 Based on the Company's current business plan assumptions and the expected cash burn rate, the Company believes that the existing cash is insufficient to fund its current level of operations for the next twelve months following the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The Company is actively monitoring its operations, cash on hand and working capital. The Company is currently in the process of reviewing and exploring external financing options in order to sustain its operations. If additional financing is not available, the Company also has contingency plans to continue to reduce or defer expenses and cash outlays in the look-forward period.

Revenues 
 
 Recurring revenue 
 
 Recurring revenue includes the Company s SaaS revenue, subscription revenue, eCommerce revenue and customer support revenue. The Company generates recurring revenue both from long-term contracts with customers that provide for periodic payments and from short-term contracts that are automatically invoiced on a monthly basis. The Company s recurring revenue is generated by a combination of direct sales, partner-assisted sales, and eCommerce sales. 
 
 Recurring revenues are generated through the Company s Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model, where the Company provides customers with the right to access the Company s software solutions for a fee. These services are made available to the customer continuously throughout the contractual period. However, the extent to which the customer uses the services may vary at the customer s discretion. The contracts with customers are generally for a term of one to five years. The payments for SaaS solutions may be received either at the inception of the arrangement or over the term of the arrangement. These SaaS solutions are considered to have a single performance obligation where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit, and as such, we recognize revenue for these arrangements ratably over the term of the contractual agreement. 
 
 The Company also currently receives recurring revenues under contracts entered into using a subscription model for data collection services and bundled hardware and software over a period. Payments for these services and subscriptions are received periodically over the term of the agreement and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. In addition, some of our subscription revenue includes providing, through a web server, access to the Company s software solutions, a self-managed database, and a cross-platform application programming interface. The subscription arrangements with these customers typically do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the Company s software at any time. Instead, customers are granted continuous access to the Company s solutions over the contractual period. The Company s subscription services arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Accordingly, any fixed consideration related to the arrangement is generally recognized as recurring revenue on a straight-line basis over the contract term beginning on the date access to the Company s software is provided. 
 
 eCommerce revenue is defined by the Company as revenue obtained through direct sales on the Company s eCommerce platform. The Company s eCommerce revenue generally includes subscriptions to the Company s vehicle recognition software that can be purchased online and activated through a digital key. The Company's contracts with eCommerce customers are generally for a term of one month with automatic renewal each month. The Company invoices and receives fees from its customers monthly. 
 
 Customer support revenue is associated with perpetual licenses and long-term subscription arrangements and consists primarily of technical support and product updates. The Company s customer support team is ready to provide these maintenance services, as needed, to the customer during the contract term. The customer benefits evenly throughout the contract period from the guarantee that the customer support resources and personnel will be available to them. As customer support is not critical to the customers' ability to derive benefit from their right to use the Company s software, customer support is considered a distinct performance obligation when sold together with a long-term license for software. Customer support for perpetual and term licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Customer support for subscription licenses is renewable concurrently with such licenses for the same duration of time. Revenue for customer support is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the start and end dates of the customer support obligation, in line with how the Company believes services are provided. 

Product and service revenue 
 
 Product and service revenue is defined as the Company s implementation revenue, perpetual license sales, hardware sales, engineering services and contactless compliance revenue. 
 
 Implementation revenue is recognized when the Company provides installation, construction and other implementation services to its customers. These services involve a fee and are typically associated with the sale of the Company s data collection services, software and hardware. The Company s implementation revenue is recognized over time as the implementation is completed. 
 
 In addition to recurring revenue from software sales, the Company recognizes point-in-time revenue related to the sale of perpetual software licenses. The Company sells perpetual licenses that provide customers the right to use software for an indefinite period in exchange for a one -time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. The Company s perpetual licenses provide a right to use intellectual property IP that is functional in nature and has significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for perpetual licenses of functional IP, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when the customer has access to the software, which normally occurs once software activation keys have been made available to the customer. 
 
 The Company also generates revenue through the sale of hardware through its partner program and internal sales force distribution channels. The Company satisfies its performance obligation upon the transfer of control of hardware to its customers. The Company invoices end-user customers upon transfer of control of the hardware to its customers. The Company provides hardware installation services to customers which range from one to six months. The revenue related to the installation component is recognized over time as the implementation is completed. 
 
 Contactless compliance revenues reflect arrangements to provide hardware systems and services that identify uninsured motor vehicles, notify owners of non-compliance through a diversion citation, and assist them in obtaining the required insurance as an alternative to traditional enforcement methods. Revenue is recognized monthly based on the number of diversion citations collected by the relevant jurisdiction. 
 
 The Company also generates revenue through its engineering services. These services are provided at the request of its customers and the revenue related to these services is recognized over time as the service is completed. 
 
 Revenue by Customer Type 
 
 The following table presents a summary of revenue by customer type (dollars in thousands): 

Transportation Management 
 Public Safety 
 Total revenue 

Urban Mobility 
 
 Urban Mobility revenue consists of revenue derived from the Company's roadway data aggregation activities. These activities can include the use of software applications that are part of the Rekor Discover platform, the primary application being Rekor s count, class speed application. This application fully automates the aggregation of Federal Highway Administration FHWA 13 -bin vehicle classification, speed, and volume data. Revenues associated with the deployment of other traffic sensors, traffic studies, or construction associated with traffic data collection are also part of data aggregation revenue, which is generated through both recurring pay-for-data contracts and hardware sales with a recurring software maintenance component. 
 
 Transportation Management 
 
 Transportation Management revenue is associated with the Rekor Command platform and the associated applications underneath the platform. These provide traffic operations and traffic management centers with support through actionable, real-time incident reports integrated into a cross-agency communication and response system. Revenue is generated through contracts that include an upfront as well as recurring component. 
 
 Public Safety 
 
 P ublic Safety revenue consists of licensing of the Rekor Scout platform, licensing of Rekor CarCheck API, licensing of Rekor s vehicle recognition software, as well as systems deployed for security, contactless compliance and public safety. Revenue is generated through recurring and perpetual license sales as well as one -time hardware sales. 
 
 Performance obligations 
 
 The Company contracts with customers in a variety of ways, including contracts that obligate the Company to provide services over time. Some contracts include performance obligations for several distinct services. For those contracts that have multiple distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the Company s overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors. This may result in a deferral or acceleration of revenue recognized relative to cash received for each distinct performance obligation. 
 
 Where performance obligations for the remaining term of a contract with a customer are not yet satisfied or have only been partially satisfied as of a particular date, the unsatisfied portion is to be recognized as revenue in the future. As of September 30, 2024 , the unsatisfied portion of the remaining performance obligation was approximately . The Company expects to recognize approximately of this amount as revenue over the succeeding twelve months, and the remainder is expected to be recognized within the next five years thereafter.

 General 
 
 Overview 
 
 Rekor was founded in 2017 and first entered the roadway intelligence business in 2019, with the acquisition of a company pioneering the development of computer vision software for roadway data collection and analysis. The software analyzes images and provides contemporaneous data about vehicles moving on the roadway, such as direction, speed, color, make, model license plate and other characteristics. The software uses a form of generative artificial intelligence, or AI, that employs neural networks to filter and identify patterns within the images and is continuously updated through machine learning that expands its capabilities and allows it to adapt to changes in the vehicle pool and other elements of the roadway environment. Rekor has continued the development of this software and has also developed a proprietary supporting operating system, which we identify as Rekor One TM . This system addresses privacy concerns and facilitates the analysis and distribution of relevant data to multiple users through edge processing and other techniques. Using Rekor One TM , we can collect, aggregate and analyze roadway data in combination with data from other sources. This analysis provides insights that are distributed to a variety of customers through our own proprietary platforms, as well as through those provided by others. While our primary customers are located in North America, products and services we provide are currently used in over 90 countries around the world. Our primary customers include national, state and municipal public agencies, as well as large commercial users in North America who employ our products and services for traffic studies, transportation management, public safety, perimeter security and tolling, as well as parking system operations. Our ultimate vision is to become the premier provider of roadway intelligence and data-driven mobility insights in the world. 
 
 Our operations are conducted primarily by our wholly-owned subsidiaries Rekor Recognition Systems, Inc., Waycare Technologies, Ltd. and Waycare Technology Inc., or Waycare, Southern Traffic Services, Inc., or STS, and All Traffic Data, LLC, or ATD. We integrated Waycare into our operations as part of a collaborative process of developing Rekor Command TM , a platform used by traffic management centers. In addition to award winning incident management tools, Waycare brought us a valuable network of established third party data sources such as weather forecasts, transit schedules, event information and other data that provide insights through predictive analytics to our traffic management customers. 
 
 The acquisition of STS in 2022 allowed us to join forces with one of the leading data suppliers to state level Departments of Transportation, or DOTs, in the United States. Throughout its history, STS has pioneered an increasingly popular pay for data model of conducting traffic studies for DOTs. Using our Rekor Discover TM platform, STS has been able to dramatically improve the quality, scope, efficiency and reliability of the data it supplies to DOTs. As more fully described under Traffic Data Collection , STS currently has contracts with several states, with a strong footprint in the Southeastern United States. We are currently engaged in discussions, including conducting proof of concept demonstrations, with additional states and municipalities to provide similar services. 
 
 On January 2, 2024, we acquired ATD, which collaborates closely with numerous traffic engineering firms, metropolitan planning organizations, municipalities, and state DOTs, in locations where Rekor previously lacked a sales presence. ATD is actively involved in data collection across a wide-ranging geographic area, encompassing states like California, Colorado, Arizona, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. This addition expands the coverage of our urban mobility operations across the country s western region and further strengthens our position in the Southeast, providing ready access to experienced urban mobility personnel and operational facilities to support the expansion of our Internet of Things, or IoT, network. 
 
 A New Operating System for Roadways 
 
 We believe there is a significant need for the innovative products and services we have developed. The current condition of national transportation infrastructure systems is a matter of concern, particularly in the United States. According to a 2021 infrastructure report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, or ASCE, U.S. infrastructure has been graded a C minus, indicating that there is significant and urgent need for improvement. Over 43 of the 4.3 million miles of U.S. roadways were rated in poor condition, which impacts the safety of drivers and passengers. The issue of congestion is also a serious concern, and was estimated to cost U.S. citizens 120 billion per year in economic and productivity losses. Transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions motorists emissions, particularly when trapped in traffic account for a significant proportion of the country s total emissions and are a leading contributor to declining sustainability, which has far-reaching environmental impacts. Addressing the road infrastructure issue is imperative for both economic and ecological reasons. Further, more than 43,000 people lose their lives each year while using the nation s transportation network of streets, roads and highways, which represents a failure in public safety and policy. On February 2, 2023, the U.S. Department of Transportation declared a national crisis and state of emergency for roadway safety and launched an urgent roadway safety call-to-action demanding stakeholders to commit to specific actions to reverse the spike in serious injuries and deaths on our roadways.

To address urgent transportation issues and ensure the competitiveness of the U.S. economy, an unprecedented amount of funding has been made available from the federal government through the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA, 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, and the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act to create digitally-enabled transportation infrastructure that will provide public goods and new economic value. This represents a once-in-a-generation level of investment and bipartisan support for creating and scaling transportation digital infrastructure for the 21st century. Rather than completely rebuilding existing infrastructure, we expect the focus to be on using the power of funding and policymaking to leverage off previous investments by promoting new technology layers and facilitating access to digital infrastructure systems throughout the country. 
 
 We expect the deployment of sophisticated roadway intelligence systems to be a significant part of both planning for and implementing the infrastructure improvements necessary to meet these challenges. Our commitment to delivering mission-critical solutions for roadway intelligence is driven by our vision of creating smarter, safer and more sustainable streets for all communities. To achieve this vision, we strive to collect, connect and organize the world s mobility data, harnessing its full potential to provide the most essential, real-time and predictive actionable mobility insights. We are working to make mobility data more accessible and useful for all responsible users, empowering our customers to make informed decisions and drive meaningful progress towards a better future. The ultimate objective is to adopt an augmented approach to existing physical infrastructure that blends the strengths of physical, digital and operational infrastructure with mobility data, including mobile phones, connected vehicles and roadway sensors. The ultimate goal is to enable and coordinate private and public collaboration through a digital-enabled mobility internet and operating system for the roadways that will advance smarter, safer and greener roadways for all. 
 
 Roadway Intelligence 
 
 Since the inception of our efforts, we have been dedicated to becoming a leader in roadway intelligence by collecting, connecting and organizing global mobility data. Today, our comprehensive portfolio offers multiple cutting-edge, AI-driven, edge-based IoT devices for roadside data collection, and an array of curated and integrated data sets from a network of transportation ecosystem data providers, tailored platforms, applications and data streams that provide accurate, real-time and predictive actionable insights about moving objects on roadways. 
 
 We specialize in collecting and aggregating mobility-related data from multiple sources into our Rekor One roadway intelligence engine, transforming this data into knowledge and actionable insights, and securely distributing those insights to multiple users across our software platforms and applications. Our proprietary technologies use recent advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analysis, edge processing and communications. They are designed to be integrated into existing roadway and roadway sensor infrastructure to deliver real-time and predictive analytics that address critical challenges in transportation management, public safety, urban mobility and other key commercial markets. 
 
 By applying a multi-layer architectural approach and protocols inspired by the Open System Interconnection, or OSI, model, which was instrumental in creating computer operating systems in the 1970s and the internet in the 1980s, we are collaborating with members of the Rekor Partner Network to integrate various transportation infrastructure systems into a cohesive network of roadway intelligence assets and insights. This involves consolidating fragmented and disparate systems, as well as adding new layers of connectivity, to create a unified infrastructure. To achieve this goal, we are working closely with a wide range of stakeholders, including local, state and federal government agencies, law enforcement, transit providers, infrastructure owners/operators, automotive OEMs and technology and communications providers. 
 
 We are working to build a future for our customers where the mobility internet is interactive, generating and distributing real-time transportation intelligence to improve traffic management, public safety, maintenance, emergency services and planning agencies, as well as by connected and autonomous vehicles. Our primary objective has been and remains to develop a unique and differentiated suite of products and services that will play a central role in facilitating this process, while aligning with key partners in the transportation ecosystem to provide the most comprehensive view of roadways. We will continue to optimize our investments to uniquely combine physical and digital infrastructure that is foundational to a new operating system for the roadways. As agencies plan for and build the transportation network of the future, we expect to play a critical and disproportionately valuable role in meeting the essential need for real-time and predictive roadway intelligence.

Opportunities, Trends and Uncertainties 
 
 We look to identify the various trends, market cycles, uncertainties and other factors that may provide us with opportunities and present challenges that impact our operations and financial condition from time to time. Although there are many that we may not or cannot foresee, we believe that our results of operations and financial condition for the foreseeable future will be primarily affected by the following: 

Growing Smart City Market According to a United Nations report, about two-thirds of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. The world s cities are getting larger, with longer commutes and the resulting impact on the environment and the quality of life. This trend requires forward-thinking officials to manage assets and resources more efficiently. We believe that advancements in big data connected devices and artificial intelligence can provide Intelligent Transportation System ITS solutions that can be used to reduce congestion, keep travelers safe, improve transportation, protect the environment, respond to climate change, and enhance the quality of life. We believe our data-driven, artificial intelligence-aided solutions provide useful tools that can effectively tackle the challenges cities and communities are facing today and will face over the coming decades. 

AI for Infrastructure We believe that the application of AI to the analysis of conditions on roadways and other transportation infrastructure can significantly affect the safety and efficiency of travel in the future. As vehicles increasingly move towards automation, there is a need for real-time data and actionable insights around traffic flow, identification of anomalous and unsafe movements e.g. wrong way vehicles, stopped vehicles, or/and pedestrians on the roadway. Marketers and drive-thru retailers with loyalty programs can also benefit from rapid, lower cost identification of existing and potential customers in streamlining and accelerating local vehicular flow as well as data about the vehicles on the roadway. 

Connected Vehicle Data Today s new vehicles are equipped with dozens of sensors, collecting information about internal systems, external hazards, and driving behaviors. This data is a resource that transportation and other agencies are beginning to find valuable uses for. Notably, the data from these vehicles represent a virtual network that is independent of the infrastructure which is maintained and operated by the public agencies. Connected vehicle sensors can provide important information related to hazardous conditions, speed variations, intersection performance, and more. This data can help agencies and municipalities gain more visibility about conditions on their roads, supplementing data from existing infrastructure and allowing transportation information from rural areas that are not served by ITS infrastructure to be integrated into the overall analysis. 

New and Expanded Uses for Vehicle Recognition Systems We believe that reductions in the cost of vehicle recognition products and services will significantly broaden the market for these systems. We currently serve many users who could not afford the cost, or adapt to the restrictions of, conventional vehicle recognition systems. These include smaller municipalities, homeowners associations, and organizations finding new applications such as innovative customer loyalty programs. We have seen and responded to an increase in the number of smaller jurisdictions that are testing vehicle recognition systems or that issued requests for proposals to install a network of vehicle recognition sensors. We also expect the availability of faster, higher-accuracy, lower-cost systems to dramatically increase the ability of crowded urban areas to manage traffic congestion and implement smart city programs. 

Adaptability of the Market We have made a considerable investment in our advanced vehicle recognition systems because we believe their increased accuracy, affordability and ability to capture additional vehicle data will allow them to compete effectively with existing providers. Based on published benchmarks, our software currently outperforms competitors. However, large users of existing technology, such as toll road operators, have long-term contracts with service providers that have made considerable investments in their existing technologies and may not consider the improvements in accuracy or reductions in cost sufficient to justify abandoning their current systems in the near future. In addition, existing providers may be able to reduce the cost of their current offerings or elect to reduce prices and accept reduced profitability while working to develop their own systems or secure advanced systems from others who are also working to develop them. As a result, our success in establishing a major position in these markets will depend on being able to effectively communicate our presence, develop strong customer relationships, and maintain leadership in providing the capabilities that customers want. As with any large market, this will require considerable effort and resources. 

Expansion of Automated Enforcement of Motor Vehicle Laws We expect contactless compliance programs to be expanded as the types of vehicle related violations authorized for automated enforcement increase and experience provides localities with a better understanding of the circumstances where it is and is not beneficial. We believe that future legislation will increasingly allow for automated enforcement of regulations such as motor vehicle insurance and registration requirements. Communities are currently searching for better means of achieving compliance with minor vehicle offenses, such as lapsed registrations, and safety issues such as motorists who fail to stop for school buses. For example, due to high rates of fatalities and injuries to law enforcement and other emergency response crews on roadsides, several states have considered authorizing automated enforcement of violations where motorists fail to slow down and/or move over for emergency responders and law enforcement vehicles at the side of the road. To the extent that legislative implementation is required, a deliberative and necessarily time-consuming process is involved. However, as states expand auto-enforcement, the market for these products and services should broaden in the public safety market. 

Graphic Processing Unit GPU Improvements We expect our business to benefit from more powerful and affordable GPU hardware that has recently been developed. These GPUs are more efficient for image processing because their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central processing units CPUs for algorithms that process large blocks of data, such as those produced by video streams. GPUs also provide superior memory bandwidth and efficiencies as compared to their CPU counterparts. The most recent versions of our software have been designed to use the increased GPU speeds to accelerate image recognition. The GPU market is predicted to grow as a result of a surge in the adoption of the Internet of Things IoT by the industrial and automotive sectors. As GPU manufacturers increase production volume, we hope to benefit from the reduced cost to manufacture the hardware included in our products or available to others using our services.

Edge Processing Demand for actionable roadway information continues to grow in parallel with sensor improvements, such as increasingly sophisticated internal software and optical and other hardware adapted to the use of this software. Over the last several decades, sensors have evolved and unlocked new capabilities with each advancement. Further, cellular networks have been optimized for downloading data rather than uploading data. As a result, while download speeds have improved significantly due to large investments in cellular infrastructure, this has resulted in relatively small improvements to cellular upload speeds. With roadside deployments experiencing explosive growth in count and density, scalability, latency and bandwidth have become aspects of competition in the market. Our systems have been designed to address these issues through the use of more effective edge processing, enabled both by incorporating the increasingly effective new GPUs into our systems and continual improvements in the efficiency of our AI algorithms. Our edge processing systems ingest local HD video streams at the source and convert the raw video data to text data, dramatically reducing the volume of data that needs to be transferred through the network. Edge processing allows us to scale a network dramatically without the bandwidth, cost, latency and dependability limitations that are experienced by other networks where raw video needs to be streamed to the cloud for processing. 

Accelerated Business Development and Marketing Our ability to compete in a large, competitive and rapidly evolving industry will require us to achieve and maintain a visible leadership position. As a result, we have made significant investments in our business development, marketing and eCommerce activities to increase awareness and market adoption of our products and services within key markets. We anticipate that a sustained presence in the market, the continued development of strategic partnerships and other economies of scale will reduce the level of costs necessary to support sales of our products and services. However, the speed at which these markets grow to the degree to which our products and services are adopted is uncertain. 

Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act IIJA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law BIL - The IIJA, signed into law on November 15, 2021, provides for significant national investments in the transportation systems in the United States, including over 150 billion in new spending on roadway infrastructure, including intelligent transportation systems. We believe that our comprehensive offering of solutions positions the Company well to emerge as a technology leader in the expanded market for roadway intelligence that will benefit from this legislation. We have identified opportunities to access federal funding streams, and we are working to implement a program that capitalizes on this unprecedented U.S. federal investment in public safety, homeland security, and transportation infrastructure and ensures that our customers are positioned to capture as much of this extraordinary government spending as possible. Beyond the many recurring federal grant programs that could support customer purchases, and the 350 billion in American Rescue Plan Act allocations that public agencies are receiving now, we are particularly excited about the prospect of benefitting from the following new grant sources that are contained in the IIJA: 200 million annually for a Safe Streets and Roads for All program that would make competitive grants for state projects that significantly reduce or eliminate transportation-related fatalities. 150 million for the current administration to establish a grant program to modernize state data collection systems 500 million for the Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation SMART Grant Program that would support demonstration projects on smart technologies that improve transportation efficiency and safety. 

Recent Acquisitions - Over the past two years, Rekor has acquired two subsidiaries as part of its plans to advance its appeal to national and local transportation agencies. In the first of these acquisitions, we acquired a leader in the development of predictive analytics for traffic management using a combination of internally generated and third party data sources. This acquisition was designed to assure transportation agencies that we were developing the most advanced data analysis systems to support their missions in safety and efficiency. In the second acquisition, we acquired one of the leading existing providers of traffic data services in the United States. Uniquely, this Company had innovated a change in the service model from providing, servicing and maintaining agency resources to a data services model where overlapping entities could benefit from our modular approach to data collection and dissemination. Each of these acquisitions has led to increased visibility for the Company among national and state level DOTs in the United States. 

Challenges to Executing on the Corporate Strategy As an acquirer and integrator of established technology companies in the ITS industry, there is an inherent risk associated with the successful implementation and execution of the strategy. If Rekor is unable to successfully implement and execute its plans, there could be a material and adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

Inability to Achieve Profitability - Rekor continues to grow its business, its operating expenses and capital expenditures have increased, and it has not yet achieved the level of sustaining profitability. As a result, if the Company is unable to generate additional revenue or achieve planned efficiencies in operations, or if its revenue declines significantly, Rekor may not be able to achieve profitability in the future, which would materially and adversely affect the Company s business. 

Inability to Retain Qualified Personnel Rekor s success depends on the continued efforts and abilities of the senior management team and key engineering and marketing specialists. Although Rekor has employment agreements with these employees, they may not choose to remain employed by Rekor. Should one or more key personnel leave the Company or join a competitor, the Company s business, operating results, and financial condition can be adversely affected. 

Inability to Compete Effectively - Competition and technological advancements by others may erode the Company s business and result in inability to capture new business and revenue. Each business line faces significant competitive pressures within the markets in which they operate. While Rekor continues to work to develop and strengthen its competitive advantages, many factors such as market and technology changes may erode or prevent this. If the Company is unable to successfully maintain its competitive advantage, the Company s business, operating results, and financial condition can be adversely affected. 

Cyber Security Risks - Rekor relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. A significant disruption or failure in the information technology systems could result in services interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against intruders, and other operational difficulties. This could result in the loss of assets and critical information and expose the Company to remediation costs and reputational damage. Although Rekor takes reasonable steps intended to mitigate these risks, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could lead to misappropriation of assets or data corruption and could adversely affect the Company s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 

Intellectual Property Claims - Third parties that have been issued patents or have filed for patent applications similar to those used by the Company s operating subsidiaries may result in intellectual property claims against the Company. Rekor cannot determine with certainty whether existing third-party patents or the issuance of any future third party patents would require any of its operating subsidiaries to alter their respective technologies, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Should the Company be unable to defend against such claims, the Company s business, operating results, and financial condition can be adversely affected.

Components of Operating Results 
 
 Revenues 
 
 The Company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of its roadway data aggregation, traffic management and licensing offerings. These offerings include a mixture of data collection, implementation, engineering, customer support and maintenance services as well as software and hardware. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to the Company s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products and services. 
 
 Costs of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization 
 
 Direct costs of revenues consist primarily of the portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages and payroll-related costs incurred in connection with revenue-generating activities. Direct costs of revenues also include production expenses, data subscriptions, sub-consultant services and other expenses that are incurred in connection with our revenue-generating activities. Direct costs of revenues exclude the portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts, vacations, holidays, and other time not spent directly generating fees under existing contracts. Such costs are included in operating expenses. We expense direct costs of revenues when they incur. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Our operating expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, sales and marketing, research and development and depreciation and amortization. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes and stock-based compensation expenses. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative departments. Additional expenses include office leases, professional fees, and insurance. 
 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the costs associated with our growth and the costs of accounting, compliance, legal, insurance, and investor relations as a public company. Our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. However, our general and administrative expenses have decreased as a percentage of our revenue and, to the extent we continue to be successful in generating increased revenue, we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, marketing programs, travel and entertainment associated with sales and marketing personnel, expenses for conferences and trade shows. We will require significant investments in our sales and marketing expenses to continue the rate of growth in our revenues, further penetrate existing markets and expand our customer base into new markets. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs, software used to develop our products and consulting and professional fees for third-party development resources. Our research and development expenses support our efforts to continue to add capabilities to and improve the value of our existing products and services, as well as develop new products and services. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investments and consist of fixed asset depreciation, amortization of intangibles considered to have definite lives, and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 
 Other income (expense) consists primarily of legal settlements, legal judgements, interest income and expense in connection with our debt arrangements, costs associated with the extinguishment of our debt arrangements, gains on the sale of subsidiaries, gains or losses on the sale of fixed assets, gain or losses on the change in fair value of our liabilities, and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and note receivables. 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 
 Income tax provision consists primarily of income taxes in certain domestic jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have recorded deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance has been provided, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future as it is more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets may not be realized based on our history of losses.

 The Company has made a preliminary estimate of the allocation of the preliminary purchase price of ATD to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value. The Company is still evaluating the fair value of intangible assets, and income taxes, in addition to ensuring all other assets and liabilities have been identified and recorded. The Company has estimated the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on information currently available and will continue to adjust those estimates as additional information pertaining to events or circumstances become available. The Company will reflect measurement period adjustments, in the period in which the adjustments occur, and the Company will finalize its accounting for the acquisition within one year from the Closing Date. A change in the fair value of the net assets may change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. If the final fair value estimates and tax adjustments related to the net assets acquired decrease from their preliminary estimates, the amount of goodwill will increase. In addition, the final fair value estimates related to the net assets acquired could impact the amount of amortization expense recorded associated with amounts allocated to tangible and intangible assets. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, such as discounted cash flow ("DCF") analyses, and thus represent Level 3 fair value measurements. 
 
 Prepaid Advance 
 
 We have elected to account for the prepaid advance at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, ASC 825 ). In this regard, ASC 825-10-15-4 provides for the fair value option election (to the extent not otherwise prohibited by ASC 825-10-15-5) to be afforded to financial instruments, wherein the financial instrument is initially measured at estimated fair value as of the transaction issue date and then subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value as of each reporting period balance sheet date, with changes in the estimated fair value recognized as other income (expense) in the statement of operations. The determination of the fair value of the prepaid advance at inception and each reporting date requires judgement from Management. The fair value of the Prepaid Advance was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation using quoted market prices of our outstanding common stock as of September 30, 2024. Based on observed price movements, we will model advance payoffs under the various scenarios. We determine the discount rate or yield of the Prepaid Advance and calculate the aggregate present value of all potential payoffs to estimate the fair value of the advance on each valuation date. Applying the stock price on close of market September 30, 2024, of 1.18 per share, volatility of 90 , a risk-free rate of 4 and an indicated yield of 12.5 , management determined the fair value of the Prepaid Advance to be 11,621,000. A change to these inputs could impact the fair value of the Prepaid Advance. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a change in fair value of the Prepaid Advance liability of 21,000. 
 
 A comprehensive discussion of our critical accounting estimates and assumptions is included in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The increase in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to our Urban Mobility revenue stream which consists of revenue derived from roadway data aggregation activities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue attributable to ATD was 1,723,000 and 7,428,000, respectively, and is included as part of our Urban Mobility revenue stream. The remainder of the increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to portable and short-term traffic services.

General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to: 

a 2,453,000 increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of ATD. 

a 545,000 increase in payroll and payroll related expenses related to our operations excluding ATD. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense decreased period over period due to the early redemption of the 2023 Promissory Notes. 
 
 (Loss) gain on extinguishment of debt is a result of early redemption of the 2023 Promissory Notes. As part of the redemption, we recorded accelerated debt issuance costs of 2,818,000 and a Redemption Payment of 1,875,000 which we settled through the issuance of common stock. 
 
 Other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased as a result of the remeasurement of the ATD Holdback Shares. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We calculate EBITDA as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for (i) impairment of intangible assets, (ii) loss on extinguishment of debt, (iii) stock-based compensation, (iv) losses or gains on sales of subsidiaries, (v) losses associated with equity method investments, (vi) merger and acquisition transaction costs and (vii) other unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of our operating performance or as a measure of liquidity or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because we believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of a company s ability to service and/or incur debt. However, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.

Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin 
 
 Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as revenue less cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as our Adjusted Gross Profit divided by our revenue. We expect Adjusted Gross Margin to continue to improve over time to the extent that we can gain efficiencies through the adoption of our technology and successfully cross-sell and upsell our current and future offerings. However, our ability to improve Adjusted Gross Margin over time is not guaranteed and could be impacted by the factors affecting our performance. We believe Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are useful to investors, as they eliminate the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allow a direct comparison of these measures between periods without the impact of non-cash expenses and certain other nonrecurring operating expenses.

Adjusted Gross Margin For the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Adjusted Gross Margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The fluctuation in Adjusted Gross Margin is typically correlated to the mix of software sales versus service type work. Typically our software sales carry a higher Adjusted Gross Margin. 
 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 
 We regularly review several indicators, including the following key indicators, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. 
 
 Recurring Revenue Growth 
 
 As part of the ongoing development of our selling strategy, we have been focusing on sales that employ contracts with recurring revenue. We expect these contracts to provide a more predictable stream of revenues, compared to one-time sales of hardware and software licenses which are generally more difficult to predict. Our recurring revenue model and revenue retention rates provide significant visibility into our future operating results and cash flow from operations. This visibility enables us to better manage and invest in our business. The following table sets forth our recurring revenue for the periods included (dollars in thousands):

We expect to continue to focus on long-term contracts with recurring revenue as part of our business model, which is intended to cause recurring revenue growth in future periods to continue to increase. However, procurement requirements for some of our largest customers may result in periods when there is an increase one-time sales as compared to recurring revenues, which may cause the proportion of recurring revenues generated in those periods to fluctuate. In addition, there may be an increase in one time sales as a result of initial installations related to the development of recurring revenue. 
 
 Performance Obligations 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 23,613,000 of contracts that were closed prior to September 30, 2024 but have a contractual period beyond September 30, 2024. This represents a decrease of 2,777,000 or 11 compared to 26,390,000 of performance obligations as of December 31, 2023. These contracts generally cover a term of one to five years, in which the Company will recognize revenue ratably over the contract term. Performance obligations for large contracts gradually decrease as they approach the renewal stage and increase if and when renewed. We currently expect to recognize approximately 15,898,000 of this amount over the succeeding twelve months, and the remainder is expected to be recognized over the following four years. On occasion, our customers will prepay the full contract or a substantial portion of the contract. Amounts related to the prepayment of the contract related to the performance obligation for a service period that is not yet met are recorded as part of our contract liabilities balance.

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 had a decrease of 886,000, which was primarily attributable to increased loss in our operations. 
 
 The increase in net cash used in investing activities of 9,207,000 was primarily due to the net cash outflow of 9,222,000 related to the acquisition of ATD. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 7,000 from the prior nine month period ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as part of our 2024 Public Offering and Prepaid Advance, we received net proceeds of 26,362,000 and 14,100,000, respectively, these proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of our 2023 Promissory Notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as part of the 2023 Promissory Notes and the 2023 Registered Direct Offering, we received net proceeds of 11,100,000 and 9,159,000, respectively. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we funded our operations primarily through cash from operating activities, the issuance of debt and the sale of equity. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 10,967,000 and a working capital deficit of 7,389,000, as compared to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 15,713,000 and working capital of 8,100,000 as of December 31, 2023.

Liquidity 

Management has assessed going concern uncertainty to determine whether there is sufficient cash on hand, together with expected capital raises and working capital, to assure operations for a period of at least one year from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued, which is referred to as the look-forward period , as defined in U.S. GAAP. As part of this assessment, based on conditions that are known and reasonably knowable to management, management has considered various scenarios, forecasts, projections, and estimates and will make certain key assumptions. These assumptions include, among other factors, its ability to raise additional capital, the expected timing and nature of the Company s programs and projected cash expenditures and its ability to delay or curtail these programs or expenditures to the extent management has the proper authority to do so and considers it probable that those implementations can be achieved within the look-forward period. 
 
 We have generated losses since our inception and have relied on cash on hand and external sources of financing to support cash flow from operations. We attribute losses to non-capital expenditures related to the scaling of existing products, development of new products and service offerings and marketing efforts associated with these products and services. As of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had working capital deficit of 7,389,000 and a net loss of 41,055,000. 
 
 Our cash decreased by 4,746,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the cash paid to acquire ATD and redeem the 2023 Promissory Notes and the net loss of 41,055,000, partially offset by external financing activity. 
 
 Based on the Company's current business plan assumptions and the expected cash burn rate, the Company believes that the existing cash is insufficient to fund its current level of operations for the next twelve months following the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The Company's ability to generate positive operating results and execute its business strategy will depend on (i) its ability to continue the growth of its customer base, (ii) its ability to continue to improve its quarterly financial metrics such as net loss and cash used from operating activities (iii) the continued performance of its contractors, subcontractors and vendors, (iv) its ability to maintain and build good relationships with investors, lenders and other financial intermediaries, (v) its ability to maintain timely collections from existing customers, and (vi) the ability to scale its business processes. To the extent that events outside of the Company's control have a significant negative impact on economic and/or market conditions, they could affect payments from customers, services and supplies from vendors, its ability to continue to secure and implement new business, raise capital, and otherwise, depending on the severity of such impact, materially adversely affect its operating results. 
 
 2024 Public Offering 
 
 On February 9, 2024, the Company issued and sold 10,000,000 shares of its common stock, at an offering price of 2.50 per share of common stock (the 2024 Public Offering Price in a registered public offering by the Company (the 2024 Public Offering ), pursuant to an underwriting agreement with William Blair Company, L.L.C., as representative of the several underwriters named therein (collectively, the Underwriters ). 
 
 On February 9, 2024, the Underwriters exercised in-full their option to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional shares of common stock at the 2024 Public Offering Price (the Underwriters Option ). The purchase closed on February 13, 2024. The net proceeds to the Company for the exercise of the Underwriters Option, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, was 2,388,000, or approximately 26,362,000 in aggregate for the 2024 Public Offering including the exercise of the Underwriters Option. 
 
 Prepaid Advance 
 
 On August 14, 2024, the Company entered into a Prepaid Advance Agreement (the Prepaid Advance with YA II PN, Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempt limited company (the Investor ), an affiliate of Yorkville Advisors Global, LP. In accordance with the terms of the Prepaid Advance, the Investor advanced to the Company 15,000,000. After giving effect to the purchase price discount provided for in the Prepaid Advance, net proceeds to the Company was 14,100,000. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.

 As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, Rekor is not required to provide the information required by Item 3. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Based on the foregoing evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weakness described below. 
 
 Identified Material Weakness 
 
 A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 
 
 Management identified a material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024. Specifically, because of the initial accounting treatment related to the acquisition of ATD, we concluded that our controls to address the risks associated with significant and unusual transactions and their impact to our financial reporting were not effectively designed or maintained. 
 
 Accordingly, we concluded that this control deficiency resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by our internal controls. Our management performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our unaudited financial statements included in this Report were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that the unaudited financial statements included in this Report present fairly, in all material respects for the periods presented. 
 
 Management s Remediation Initiative 
 
 While we have processes to properly identify significant or unusual transactions, we plan to continue to improve these processes to ensure that the nuances of such transactions are effectively evaluated in the context of the increasingly complex accounting and tax standards. 
 
 To further strengthen our internal controls, we plan to modify our management review controls over significant and unusual transactions to engage our accounting and tax experts prior to our reporting deadlines to assist in identifying the implications of transactions deemed to be significant and unusual that occurred during the applicable period. 
 
 The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively. We anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2024. 
 
 Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, the Company may be named as a party to various other lawsuits, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, infringement of proprietary rights, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to such lawsuits, claims and proceedings the Company accrues reserves when a loss is probable, and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. 

H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC 
 
 In March 2023, the Company entered into an engagement letter with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC, ("HCW"), related to a capital raise (see NOTE 9 STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY ). That letter agreement contained provisions for both a tail fee due to HCW for any subsequent transactions the Company may enter into during the specified tail period with investors introduced to the Company by HCW during the term of the letter, as well as a right of first refusal ("ROFR") to act as the Company's exclusive underwriter or placement agent on any subsequent financing transactions utilizing an underwriter or placement agent occurring within twelve months from the consummation of a transaction pursuant to the engagement letter. 
 
 In July 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with one of its warrant holders in connection with the exercise of warrants, which the Company refers to as the July Warrant Exercise Transaction. Subsequent to the July Warrant Exercise Transaction, the Company received a letter from HCW claiming entitlement to certain tail fees and warrant consideration stemming from the agreement with the warrant holder. The Company believed then, and believes now, that this claim is without merit. As a result of this claim and for other reasons articulated to HCW, the Company terminated its engagement letter with HCW, including for cause, which, the Company believes, eliminated both the tail provision and the ROFR provision with respect to the 2023 Registered Direct Offering. 
 
 On or about October 23, 2023, HCW filed a complaint in New York State Supreme Court asserting a claim for breach of contract against the Company relating to the July Warrant Exercise Transaction. HCW sought to recover compensatory and consequential damages and certain warrants under its letter agreement with Rekor and other fees, not less than a cash fee of 825,000 and the value of warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 481,100 shares of common stock of the company at an exercise price of 2.00 per share as well as attorneys fees. On February 29, 2024, HCW filed a notice of discontinuance without prejudice and advised the court that it intended to commence a new proceeding by filing a new complaint that would address the claim in this lawsuit and subsequent events. On March 4, 2024, the court discontinued this lawsuit without prejudice. 
 
 On February 29, 2024, HCW initiated a new action with the filing of complaint in New York State Supreme Court. In this lawsuit, HCW advances the same breach of contract theory and seeks to recover the same damages as sought in the prior now-dismissed lawsuit. In addition, HCW seeks to recover an additional 2,156,000 in damages plus the value of warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 805,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 3.125 per share in connection with Rekor s February 2024 offering, which we refer to as the 2024 Public Offering. HCW alleges that Rekor breached its engagement letter with HCW by failing to give HCW notice of this offering and failing to provide HCW with the opportunity to exercise the ROFR with respect to this transaction. On May 3, 2024, Rekor answered HCW s complaint and filed counterclaims against HCW and Armistice Capital LLC ("Armistice") relating to Rekor s March 2023 Registered Direct Offering, Armistice s trading activity in Rekor common stock, and Rekor s 2024 Public Offering. After HCW and Armistice moved to dismiss Rekor s counterclaims, Rekor filed amended counterclaims on October 1, 2024. Rekor seeks to recover damages from HCW and Armistice. 
 
 The Company believes these claims are without merit. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in this lawsuit. 
 
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA Claim 
 
 In 2023 two previous employees of the Company (the Claimants filed a complaint with OSHA (the OSHA Complaints against the Company. Shortly after the OSHA Complaints were filed against the Company, the Company filed a position statement to address the OSHA Complaints. On November 30, 2023, OSHA issued its determination that, based on the information gathered thus far in its investigation, OSHA was unable to conclude that there was reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the statute occurred. OSHA thereby dismissed the complaint. 
 
 Thereafter, Claimants appealed the determination by filing objections and requesting a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. The Company likewise filed a request for an award of attorneys fees. On January 4, 2024, the Office of Administrative Law Judges OALJ processed the appeals and issued its Notice of Docketing and Order of Consolidation. On February 28, 2024, the OALJ issued an Order setting forth a revised schedule governing the case with the start of the hearing scheduled for March 3, 2025. 
 
 The Company believes these claims are without merit. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in this lawsuit.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 25, 2024, as supplemented by the risk factors disclosed in Risk Factors in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on May 15, 2024. We encourage investors to review the risk factors and uncertainties relating to our business disclosed in that Form 10-K, as supplement by that Form 10-Q, as well as those contained in Part 1, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, above. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 2023 Promissory Notes with Warrants 
 
 As previously disclosed under Item 3.02 in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 18, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the investors in a private placement transaction (i) up to 15,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of senior secured promissory notes, and (ii) warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company. In connection with the initial closing on January 18, 2023, the Company issued 12,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes and warrants to purchase 6,250,000 shares of Common Stock, resulting in proceeds to the Company of 12,500,000 before reimbursement of expenses. 

New Registered Direct Warrants 

On July 25, 2023, we entered into a letter agreement with an institutional investor in connection with the Registered Direct Warrants. Pursuant to the letter agreement, we agreed to issue to the institutional investor 2,850,000 unregistered warrants (the "2023 Private Warrants") to purchase shares of our common stock in exchange for the imposition of volume and trading restrictions on the 6,872,853 shares of common stock issued to the institutional investor in connection with exercise of the 2023 Private Warrants. The 2023 Private Warrants terminate on January 25, 2029, and are exercisable after issuance only for cash. The 2023 Private Warrants have an exercise price of 3.25 per share. The shares of common stock underlying the 2023 Private Warrants have been registered for resale on Form S-3. 
 
 ATD Acquisition 
 
 As previously disclosed under Item 3.02 in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 3, 2024, as part of the purchase price the Company issued 2,832,135 shares of the Company s common stock as part of the consideration. Additionally, 664,329 shares will be issued and delivered to the Seller on the twelve-month anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to cutback for working capital adjustments and/or indemnification claims favoring the Company, if any. The ATD Holdback Shares were deemed to be liability based and are measured at fair value each reporting period. The shares issued and issuable in connection with the ATD Acquisition have been registered on a resale registration statement on Form S-3, declared effective by the SEC on June 17, 2024. 
 
 2023 Promissory Notes Redemption 
 
 On March 4, 2024, the Company completed the redemption of all its outstanding senior secured notes (the 2023 Promissory Notes ). The 2023 Promissory Notes were redeemed at the redemption price of 115 of the 12,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Promissory Notes, or approximately 14,375,000, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date of approximately 263,000, (the Redemption Payment ). The noteholders elected to accept 1,875,000 of the Redemption Payment in the form of 750,000 unregistered shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, having a value of 2.50 per share, with the remainder of the Redemption Payment paid in cash. On July 19, 2024, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 to register these shares, which was declared effective by the SEC on July 30, 2024. 
 
 Warrant Exercise Agreements 
 
 On June 20, 2024, the Company entered into various Warrant Exercise Agreements with certain holders of the 2023 Warrants (each an Exercising Holder and collectively, the Exercising Holders ), pursuant to which the Company reduced the strike price of the 2023 Warrants from 2.00 per warrant to 1.40 per warrant to induce their exercise. In June 2024, all but one of the Exercising Holders subsequently exercised 1,400,000 warrants for common stock in exchange for 1,960,000. In July 2024, the remaining Exercising Holder exercised 2,275,000 warrants for common stock in exchange for 3,185,000. 
 
 In consideration for the Company s agreement to reduce the exercise price, the Exercising Holders agreed to a concomitant reduction in the number of shares into which the 2023 Warrants are exercisable, from 5,250,000 to 3,675,000. This modification resulted in a decrease in the overall fair value of the equity classified warrants and since no incremental value was given to the Exercising Holders, nothing was recorded in the consolidated financial statements related to the modification. The shares issued in connection with the Warrant Exercise Agreement have been registered on a resale registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on July 19, 2024, and declared effective by the SEC on July 30, 2024. 
 
 Use of Proceeds 
 
 We have generated losses since our inception and have relied on cash on hand, external bank lines of credit, short-term borrowing arrangements, issuance of debt, the sale of a note, sale of our non-core subsidiaries, and the sale of common stock to provide cash for operations. We attribute losses to financing costs, public company corporate overhead, lower than expected revenue, and lower gross profit of some of our subsidiaries. Our cash proceeds have been primarily used for the acquisitions described above, research and development, legal, financing costs, acquisition costs and sales and marketing expenses related to new product development and our strategic shift to develop and promote the capabilities of our technology offerings.
