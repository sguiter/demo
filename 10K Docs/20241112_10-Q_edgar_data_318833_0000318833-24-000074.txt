 segments: Inspection and Heat Treating IHT and Mechanical Services MS ). Through the capabilities and resources in these segments, we believe that we are uniquely qualified to provide integrated solutions involving: inspection to assess condition; engineering assessment to determine fitness for purpose in the context of industry standards and regulatory codes; and mechanical services to repair, rerate or replace based upon the customer s election. In addition, we are capable of escalating with the customer s needs, as dictated by the severity of the damage found and the related operating conditions, from standard services to some of the most advanced services and integrated asset integrity and reliability management solutions available in the industry. We also believe that we are unique in our ability to provide these services in distinct customer demand profiles: (i) turnaround or project services, (ii) call-out services, and (iii) nested or run-and-maintain services. 
 IHT provides conventional and advanced non-destructive testing services primarily for the process, pipeline and power sectors, pipeline integrity management services, and field heat treating services, as well as associated engineering and condition assessment services. These services can be offered while facilities are running (onstream), during facility turnarounds or during new construction or expansion activities. In addition, IHT provides comprehensive non-destructive testing services and metallurgical and chemical processing services to the aerospace industry, covering a range of components including finished machined and in-service components. IHT also provides advanced digital imaging including remote digital video imaging. 
 MS provides solutions designed to serve customers unique needs during both the operational (onstream) and off-line states of their assets. Our onstream services include our range of standard to custom-engineered leak repair and composite solutions; emissions control and compliance; hot tapping and line stopping; and online valve insertion solutions, which are delivered while assets are in an operational condition, which maximizes customer production time. Asset shutdowns can be planned, such as a turnaround maintenance event, or unplanned, such as those due to component failure or equipment breakdowns. Our specialty maintenance, turnaround and outage services are designed to minimize customer downtime and are primarily delivered while assets are off-line and often through the use of cross-certified technicians, whose multi-craft capabilities deliver the production needed to achieve tight time schedules. These critical services include on-site field machining; bolted-joint integrity; vapor barrier plug testing; and valve management solutions. 
 We market our services to companies in a diverse array of heavy industries which include: 
 Energy (refining, power, renewables, nuclear, offshore oil and gas, and liquefied natural gas); 
 Manufacturing and Process (chemical, petrochemical, pulp and paper industries, automotive, and mining);

 1970 Group Substitute Insurance Reimbursement Facility 
 On September 16, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated substitute insurance reimbursement facility agreement with 1970 Group Inc. 1970 Group (such agreement, the Substitute Insurance Reimbursement Facility Agreement ). Under the Substitute Insurance Reimbursement Facility Agreement, the 1970 Group extended credit to us in the form of a substitute reimbursement facility (the Substitute Reimbursement Facility to provide up to approximately million of letters of credit on our behalf in support of our workers compensation, commercial automotive and general liability insurance policies. As of September 30, 2024, we have million of letters of credit outstanding under the Substitute Reimbursement Facility. 
 According to the provisions of ASC 470, Debt , the arrangement is a Substitute Insurance Reimbursement Facility limited to the amounts drawn under the letters of credit. Therefore, until we use or there is a draw on such Substitute Insurance Reimbursement Facility, the letters of credit are treated as an off-balance sheet credit arrangement. The fees paid by us periodically under this arrangement are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the term of the arrangement. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately million of unamortized deferred fees.

 million as of September 30, 2024 in other accrued liabilities, and have recorded a related receivable from our third-party insurance providers in other current assets in the same amount. Such amounts are treated as non-cash operating activities. The Most litigation is covered by our general liability and excess insurance policies which are occurrence based and subject to an aggregate million self-insured retention and deductible. All retentions and deductibles have been met, and accordingly, we believe pending the final settlement, all further claims will be fully funded by our insurance policies. We will continue to evaluate the possible outcomes of this case in light of future developments and their potential impact on factors relevant to our assessment of any possible loss. 
 Notice of repayment of pandemic related government subsidies - In response to widespread health crises, epidemics and pandemics, certain of our entities based in foreign jurisdictions received governmental funding assistance to compensate for a portion of employee wages between March 2020 and March 2022. Following ongoing compliance reviews of these funding assistance programs, we received notices stating noncompliance with the requirements of one of these funding assistance programs. Accordingly, based on the assessments completed by the government appointed administrative authority, previously we had accrued million to be repaid over an extended period related to this noncompliance. However, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we successfully appealed against million of the assessment, which resulted in the reduction of the accrued liability from million to million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Accordingly, for all matters discussed within this Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies , we have accrued in the aggregate approximately million as of September 30, 2024, of which approximately million is not covered by our various insurance policies. 
 In addition to legal matters discussed above, we are subject to various lawsuits, claims and proceedings encountered in the normal conduct of business Other Proceedings ). Management believes that based on its current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel that the Other Proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements below. 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements may be made by us or on our behalf in other materials we release to the public including all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, that address activities, events or developments which we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future.

 We based our forward-looking statements on our reasonable beliefs and assumptions, and our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions about events and circumstances that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements cannot be relied upon as a guarantee of future results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statements, including, but not limited to the statements under Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

 risk of non-payment and/or delays in payment of receivables from our customers; 
 our ability to regain compliance with the NYSE s continued listing requirements and rules, and the risk that the NYSE may delist our common stock, which could negatively affect our company, the price of our common stock and our shareholders ability to sell our common stock in the event we are unable to list our common stock on another exchange; 
 our financial forecasts being based upon estimates and assumptions that may materially differ from actual results; 
 our incurrence of liabilities and suffering of negative financial or reputational impacts relating to occupational health and safety matters;

GENERAL OVERVIEW 
 Business . We are a global, leading provider of specialty industrial services offering customers access to a full suite of conventional, specialized, and proprietary mechanical, heat-treating, and inspection services. We deploy conventional to highly specialized inspection, condition assessment, maintenance and repair services that result in greater safety, reliability, and operational efficiency for our customers most critical assets. We conduct operations in two segments: IHT and MS. Through the capabilities and resources in these two segments, we believe that we are uniquely qualified to provide integrated solutions involving: inspection to assess condition; engineering assessment to determine fitness for purpose in the context of industry standards and regulatory codes; and mechanical services to repair, rerate or replace based upon the customers election. In addition, we are capable of escalating with the customer s needs, as dictated by the severity of the damage found and the related operating conditions, from standard services to some of the most advanced services and integrated asset integrity and reliability management solutions available in the industry. We also believe that we are unique in our ability to provide these services in three distinct customer demand profiles: (i) turnaround or project services, (ii) call-out services, and (iii) nested or run-and-maintain services. 
 IHT provides conventional and advanced non-destructive testing services primarily for the process, pipeline and power sectors, pipeline integrity management services, and field heat treating services, as well as associated engineering and condition assessment services. These services can be offered while facilities are running (onstream), during facility turnarounds or during new construction or expansion activities. In addition, IHT provides comprehensive non-destructive testing services and metallurgical and chemical processing services to the aerospace industry, covering a range of components including finished machined and in-service components. IHT also provides advanced digital imaging including remote digital video imaging. 
 MS provides solutions designed to serve customers unique needs during both the operational (onstream) and off-line states of their assets. Our onstream services include our range of standard to custom-engineered leak repair and composite solutions; emissions control and compliance; hot tapping and line stopping; and online valve insertion solutions, which are delivered while assets are in an operational condition, which maximizes customer production time. Asset shutdowns can be planned, such as a turnaround maintenance event, or unplanned, such as those due to component failure or equipment breakdowns. Our specialty maintenance, turnaround and outage services are designed to minimize customer downtime and are primarily delivered while assets are off-line and often through the use of cross-certified technicians, whose multi-craft capabilities deliver the production needed to achieve tight time schedules. These critical services include on-site field machining; bolted-joint integrity; vapor barrier plug testing; and valve management solutions. 
 We market our services to companies in a diverse array of heavy industries which include: 
 Energy (refining, power, renewables, nuclear, offshore oil and gas, and liquefied natural gas); 
 Manufacturing and Process (chemical, petrochemical, pulp and paper industries, automotive, and mining); 
 Midstream (valves, terminals and storage, and pipeline); 
 Public Infrastructure (construction and building, roads, dams, amusement parks, bridges, ports, and railways); and 
 Aerospace and Defense. 
 
 Listing Notice from NYSE. On March 14, 2024 , we were notified by the NYSE of our non-compliance with their continued listing standards, as our total market capitalization and shareholders equity had fallen below the NYSE listing 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 requirements. As required by the NYSE, we notified the NYSE of our intent to cure the market capitalization and/or shareholders equity deficiency and restore our compliance with NYSE continued listing standards. 
 
 In accordance with applicable NYSE procedures, on April 29, 2024, we submitted a plan advising the NYSE of the definitive actions we have taken and are taking that would bring us into compliance with NYSE continued listing standards within 12 months of receipt of the written notice. The NYSE accepted the plan, and our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the 12-month period beginning March 14, 2024, subject to our compliance with other NYSE continued listing standards and continued periodic review by the NYSE of our progress with respect to our plan. We intend to regain compliance with the NYSE listing standards by pursuing measures that are in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to satisfy any of the steps outlined in the plan approved by the NYSE and maintain the listing of our shares on the NYSE. In the event we are unable to maintain the listing of our shares on the NYSE, we may look to list our shares on alternative exchanges. 
 
 Recent Financing Amendments . On September 30, 2024, we entered into certain amendments with our lenders. Refer to Note 10 - Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details. 

Results of Operations 
 The following is a comparison of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The following table sets forth the components of revenue and operating income (loss) from our operations for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Favorable (Unfavorable) 
 2024 2023 (unaudited) (unaudited) Revenues by business segment: IHT 107,604 103,857 3,747 3.6 MS 103,154 102,858 296 0.3 Total revenues 210,758 206,715 4,043 2.0 Operating income (loss): IHT 9,860 6,412 3,448 53.8 MS 4,460 6,482 (2,022) (31.2) Corporate and shared support services (11,162) (14,152) 2,990 21.1 Total operating income (loss) 
 3,158 (1,258) 4,416 351.0 Interest expense, net (11,770) (10,067) (1,703) (16.9) Loss on debt extinguishment (3) 3 100.0 Other (expense) income, net

Revenues. Total revenues increased 4.0 million or 2.0 from the prior year quarter. IHT revenues increased by 3.7 million or 3.6 primarily due to an increase in U.S. revenue of 6.7 million driven by higher activity in nested and turnaround services, partially offset by lower Canada operations revenue of 3.0 million due to lower activity in nested and turnaround services. MS revenue increased by 0.3 million or 0.3 , comprised of a 2.3 million increase in U.S. operations due to higher turnaround activity and valve services, partially offset by a 1.2 million decrease in Canada operations due to less project work and a 0.8 million decrease in other international regions revenue caused by lower overall activity. 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 Operating income (loss). Overall operating income was 3.2 million in the current year quarter, a 4.4 million improvement compared to the prior year quarter. IHT operating income increased by 3.4 million or 53.8 , with the U.S. increasing by 4.7 million primarily due to higher gross margin and lower costs, partially offset by a decrease in operating income from Canada of 1.2 million driven mainly by lower revenue for the period. MS operating income decreased by 2.0 million or 31.2 as compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to a 2.2 million decrease in operating income from international regions and a 0.4 million decrease from Canada operations, driven mainly by lower revenue and project mix, partially offset by an increase in U.S. operating income of 0.6 million. Corporate operating loss decreased by 3.0 million due to lower professional fees and the reversal of a legal reserve in the current period as further described in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating income (loss) includes net expenses (credits) totaling 1.3 million and 2.8 million, respectively, that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating activities, as detailed in the table below (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Operating income (loss) 3,158 (1,258) Professional fees and other 318 1,452 Legal costs (credits) 
 (1,975) 650 Severance charges, net 309 655 Total non-core items 
 (1,348) 2,757 Operating income, excluding non-core items 
 1,810 1,499 
 Excluding the impact of these identified non-core items in both periods, operating income increased by 0.3 million from 1.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. See our non-GAAP reconciliation for additional details of our non-core expenses. 
 
 Interest expense, net. Interest expense increased by 1.7 million compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily attributable to increased interest rates on our various debt arrangements and higher debt balances. 
 Cash interest paid during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 7.1 million and 5.0 million, respectively. 
 
 Other (expense) income, net. Overall change in other (expense) income is primarily due to the negative impact of a loss on foreign currency fluctuation of 2.9 million. 

Taxes. The provision for income tax was 0.5 million on the pre-tax loss of 10.6 million in the current year quarter, compared to a 1.1 million income tax provision on a pre-tax loss of 11.1 million in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate, inclusive of discrete items, was a provision of 4.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 9.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is due to the mix of pretax income in non-valuation allowance jurisdictions and pretax losses in valuation allowance jurisdictions, along with changes in valuation allowances in 2023. The impact is a larger decrease in income tax expense as compared to pretax income, resulting in a decrease of effective tax rate.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The following is a comparison of our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (in thousands).

Revenues. Total revenues decreased 9.5 million or 1.5 from the prior year period. IHT segment year-to-date revenue decreased by 2.1 million or 0.7 compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by decreased call out and turnaround activities in Canada and other international regions of 10.5 million, partially offset by an increase in U.S. operations revenue of 8.4 million. MS segment revenue decreased by 7.4 million or 2.3 compared to the prior year period, mainly due to a 7.6 million decrease in Canada attributable to projects from the 2023 period that did not repeat in the 2024 period. 

Operating income (loss). Overall operating income was 7.9 million in the 2024 period, a 12.3 million or 279.9 improvement as compared to an operating loss of 4.4 million in the prior year period. IHT operating income increased by 9.8 million or 55.5 , primarily driven by improved gross margins and lower costs. MS operating income decreased by 3.2 million or 14.3 as compared to the prior year period. MS operating income from other international operations and Canada decreased by 3.5 million and 2.5 million, respectively, primarily driven by lower year over year revenue due to projects from the prior year period that did not repeat in 2024. This decrease in operating income was partially offset by an increase in operating income from U.S. operations of 2.8 million driven by higher activity and improved margins. Corporate operating loss decreased by 5.7 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower professional fees and the reversal of a legal reserve in the current period as further described in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating income (loss) includes net expenses totaling 2.0 million and 7.8 million, respectively, that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating activities, as detailed in the table below (in thousands):

The decrease was primarily attributable to the accelerated amortization of debt related deferred cost until June 16, 2023 which was not applicable during the current year period. This decrease was partially offset by higher interest expense on our various debt arrangements due to increased interest rates and higher debt balances. 
 Cash interest paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 19.5 million and 14.5 million, respectively. 
 
 Other (expense) income, net . Overall change in other (expense) income, net is primarily due to the negative impact of loss on foreign currency fluctuations of 2.3 million. 
 
 Taxes. T he provision for income tax was 2.0 million on the pre-tax loss of 29.0 million in the current year-to-date period compared to income tax expense o f 4.0 million o n the pre-tax loss of 48.6 million in the prior year-to-date period. The effective tax rate was a provision of 7.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 8.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate differs from the prior year period due to changes in the valuation allowance.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations 
 We use supplemental non-GAAP financial measures which are derived from the consolidated financial information including adjusted net income (loss); adjusted net income (loss) per share; earnings before interest and taxes EBIT adjusted EBIT; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. 
 We define adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share to exclude the following items: non-routine legal costs and settlements, non-routine professional fees, (gain) loss on debt extinguishment, severance charges, non-routine write-off of assets and certain other items that we believe are not indicative of core operating activities. Consolidated adjusted EBIT, as defined by us, excludes the costs excluded from adjusted net income (loss) as well as income tax expense (benefit), interest charges, foreign currency (gain) loss, pension credit, and items of other (income) expense. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA further excludes depreciation, amortization, and non-cash share-based compensation costs from consolidated adjusted EBIT. Segment adjusted EBIT is equal to segment operating income (loss) excluding costs associated with non-routine legal costs and settlements, non-routine professional fees, severance charges, and certain other items as determined by us. Segment adjusted EBITDA further excludes depreciation, amortization, and non-cash share-based compensation costs from segment adjusted EBIT. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus capital expenditures. 
 We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of our financial position and results of operations. In particular, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share, consolidated adjusted EBIT, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures of performance which are commonly used by industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies to analyze operating performance in our industry, perform analytical comparisons, benchmark performance between periods, and measure our performance against externally communicated targets. Our segment adjusted EBIT and segment adjusted EBITDA are also used as a basis for the Chief Operating Decision Maker (Chief Executive Officer) to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments. Free cash flow is used by our management and investors to analyze our ability to service and repay debt and return value directly to stakeholders. 
 Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Further, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies who may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. The liquidity measure of free cash flow does not represent a precise calculation of residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented below. 
 The following tables set forth the reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss), EBIT and EBITDA to their most comparable GAAP financial measurements on a consolidated and segmented basis:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Financing for operations consists primarily of our 2022 ABL Credit Agreement (which includes the Revolving Credit Loans, the Delayed Draw Term Loan and the ME/RE Loans), the A R Term Loan Credit Agreement (which includes the Uptiered Loan and the Incremental Term Loan), and cash flows from our operations. 
 We have evaluated our liquidity within one year after the date of issuance of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements to assess the Company s ability to fund its operations. Based upon such liquidity assessment, we believe that the Company s current working capital, forecasted cash flows from operations, expected availability under our existing debt arrangements and capital expenditure financing is sufficient to fund our operations, service our indebtedness, and maintain compliance with our debt covenants. In preparation of this liquidity assessment, we applied judgment to estimate the projected cash flows of the Company, including the following: (i) projected cash outflows, (ii) projected cash inflows, and (iii) projected availability under the Company s existing debt arrangements. The cash flow projections were based on known or planned cash requirements for operating and financing costs and include management s best estimate regarding future customer activity levels, pricing for its services and for its supplies and other factors. Actual results could vary significantly from those projections. We based this assessment on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect in the event that we fail to meet our current projections. See Note 10 - Debt in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 11 - Debt in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details of our debt obligations. 
 We closely monitor the amounts and timing of our sources and uses of funds. Our ability to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to fund our operations and meet our financial obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. For example, the threat of recession and related economic repercussions could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position and business condition, as well as that of our customers and suppliers. Additionally, these events may, among other factors, impact our ability to generate cash flows from operations, access the capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, service our indebtedness, maintain compliance with the financial covenants contained in our various credit agreements and affect our future need or ability to borrow under our 2022 ABL Credit Facility and our A R Term Loan Credit Agreement. Our ability to access the capital markets will depend on financial, economic and market conditions, many of which are outside of our control, and we may be unable to raise financing when needed, or on terms favorable to us, or at all. In addition, we may seek to engage in one or more of the following, such as refinancing and/or extending the maturities of all or part of our existing indebtedness, amend existing debt to gain additional flexibility, entering into a strategic partnership with one or more parties, or the sale or divestiture of assets, but there can be no assurance that we would be able to enter into such a transaction or transactions on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or at all. Our failure to raise capital through our operations, refinancing or strategic alternatives as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. In addition to impacting our current sources of funding, the effects of such events may also impact our liquidity or require us to revise our allocation or sources of capital, reduce capital expenditures, implement further cost reduction measures and/or change our business strategy. Political economic repercussions could also have a broad range of effects on our liquidity sources and will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted at this time. 
 Our ability to generate operating cash flow, sell assets, access capital markets or take any other action to improve our liquidity and manage our debt is subject to the risks described or referenced herein and other risks and uncertainties that exist in our industry, some of which we may not be able to anticipate at this time or control. Such risks include the following: 
 loss of customers or other unforeseen deterioration in demand for our services; 
 seasonal fluctuations, such as severe weather and other variations in our customers industries that may impede or delay the timing of customer orders and the delivery of our services; 
 rapid increases in raw materials and labor costs that may hinder our ability to meet our forecasted operating expenses; 
 persisting or increasing levels of inflation domestically and internationally and the impact of such inflation on our ability to meet our current forecast; 
 changes in regulations governing our operations and unplanned costs to comply with such regulatory changes; 
 counterparty credit risk related to our ability to collect our receivables; and 
 unexpected or prolonged fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our forecasted costs of raising additional capital. 
 See Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, we entered into Amendment No.5 to the 2022 ABL Credit Agreement. ABL Amendment No.5 amended the 2022 ABL Credit Agreement to, among other things, to: 
 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 (i) extend the scheduled maturity date from August 11, 2025 to September 30, 2027; 
 
 (ii) amend the applicable margin for Delayed Draw Term Loans from a flat rate of 10.00 for SOFR Loans (as defined in the 2022 ABL Credit Agreement) and 9.00 for Base Rate Loans (as defined in the 2022 ABL Credit Agreement) to a rate based on EBITDA ranging from 8.50 to 10.00 for SOFR Loans and 7.50 to 9.00 for Base Rate Loans; 
 
 (iii) amend the applicable margin for Revolving Credit Loans from a rate based on EBITDA ranging from 4.15 to 4.65 for SOFR Loans and 3.15 to 3.65 for Base Rate Loans to a rate based on both EBITDA and Average Historical Excess Availability (as defined in the 2022 ABL Credit Agreement) ranging from 3.50 to 4.25 for SOFR Loans and 2.50 to 3.25 for Base Rate Loans; 
 
 (iv) amend the applicable margin for ME/RE Loans from a flat rate of 5.75 for SOFR Loans to a flat rate of 5.00 for SOFR Loans; 
 
 (v) amend the definitions of Borrowing Base and Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as well as related definitions in order to expand availability under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in the 2022 ABL Credit Agreement); and 
 (vi) add a springing financial covenant requiring Excess Availability (as defined in the 2022 ABL Credit Agreement) to be above 7,500,000 only if the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio falls below 0.85x for twelve-month periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2024 and 1.00x for twelve month periods ending after December 31, 2024. 
 
 ABL Amendment No.5 significantly improved availability under our Revolving Credit Loans and as of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 28.0 million of borrowing capacity consisting of 18.0 million available under the Revolving Credit Loans, and 10.0 million available under the Incremental Term Loan. Our principal uses of cash are for working capital, capital expenditures, and operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. Our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants contained in the 2022 ABL Credit Agreement and the A R Term Loan Credit Agreement is dependent upon our future operating performance and future financial condition, both of which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. 
 As of November 8, 2024, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 9.9 million, excluding 4.1 million of restricted cash used mainly as collateral for letters of credit and commercial card programs, and approximately 30.5 million of undrawn availability under our various credit facilities, resulting in total liquidity of 40.4 million. 
 Refer to Note 10 - Debt in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 11 - Debt in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our debt instruments. 
 Cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 totaled 19.1 million, consisting of 14.9 million of unrestricted cash on hand, and 4.2 million of restricted cash. International cash balances as of September 30, 2024 were 6.2 million, and approximately 0.6 million of such cash is located in countries where currency or regulatory restrictions exist. 
 As of December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents were 35.4 million, including 30.4 million of unrestricted cash on hand, and 5.0 million of restricted cash. International cash balances as of December 31, 2023 were 12.0 million, including 0.6 million of cash located in countries where currency or regulatory restrictions existed. 
 Our total debt and finance obligations were 321.2 million, of which 7.1 million was classified as current at September 30, 2024, compared to total debt of 311.4 million at December 31, 2023.

 Cash flows attributable to our operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 1.1 million, an improvement of 23.2 million as compared to net cash used in operating activities of 22.1 million in the 2023 period. Our improvement in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by reduced net loss due to improved operating income, and lower negative working capital impacts of 14.5 million primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable and lower accrued liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. Our net cash provided by operating activities were further impacted by amortization of debt issuance costs of 4.7 million, depreciation and amortization of 27.9 million, and PIK interest of 11.0 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 22.1 million. Our net cash used in operating activities was driven by our net loss for the period, which totaled 52.6 million, and negative working capital impacts of 26.2 million, partially offset by amortization of debt issuance costs of 16.9 million, depreciation and amortization of 28.5 million, and PIK interest of 10.9 million. 
 
 Cash flows attributable to our investing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 7.3 million, consisting of capital expenditures of 7.4 million, partially offset by cash proceeds from asset sales of 0.1 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 7.0 million, consisting primarily of capital expenditures of 7.4 million, partially offset by 0.4 million of cash proceeds from asset sales. 
 
 Cash flows attributable to our financing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 9.9 million, consisting primarily of payment of debt issuance costs of 7.4 million, principal payments under the ME/RE loans of 2.1 million, and principal payments under the Incremental Term Loan of 1.1 million, partially offset by net borrowings under equipment finance loan of 1.9 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 7.4 million, consisting primarily of net borrowings under our 2022 ABL Credit Facility of 11.0 million, borrowings under ME/RE loans of 27.4 million and borrowings under the Incremental Term Loan of 42.5 million, offset by the payoff of the APSC Term Loan of 37.1 million, payoff of the 5.00 Convertible Senior Notes of 41.2 million and payment of debt issuance cost of 8.4 million. 
 
 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash was negative 0.3 million and negative 0.1 million, respectively. The impact of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to fluctuations in U.S. Dollar exchange rate against the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, the British Pound, the Australian Dollar and Mexican Peso. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 From time-to-time, we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. See Note 10 - Debt in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 11 - Debt in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details of our off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Other than as noted below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors as previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 We may not be able to regain compliance with the NYSE s continued listing requirements and rules, the NYSE may delist our common stock, which could negatively affect the Company, the price of our common stock and our shareholders ability to sell our common stock. The NYSE has several listing requirements set forth in the NYSE Listed Company Manual. For example, Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires that our common stock trade at a minimum average closing price of 1.00 per share over a consecutive 30 trading day period. Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires that either our average global market capitalization (inclusive of common and preferred equity) or our total shareholders equity exceed 50.0 million. 
 On March 14, 2024, the Company received a written notice (the Written Notice from the NYSE that the Company was not in compliance with the continued listing standards set forth in Rule 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because its average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period was less than 50.0 million and, at the same time, its last reported shareholders equity was less than 50.0 million. As required by the NYSE, the Company timely notified the NYSE of its intent to cure the deficiency and restore its compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards. On April 29, 2024, in accordance with applicable NYSE procedures, the Company submitted a plan (the Plan advising the NYSE of the definitive actions the Company has taken, and is taking, that would bring it into compliance with the minimum global market capitalization listing standard within 12 months of receipt of the Written Notice. The NYSE accepted the Plan, and the Company s common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the 12-month period beginning March 14, 2024, subject to the Company s compliance with other NYSE continued listing standards and continued periodic review by the NYSE of the Company s progress with respect to the Plan. The Written Notice has no immediate impact on the listing of the Company s common stock, which will continue to trade on the NYSE during the applicable cure period and does not result in a default under the Company's material debt or other agreements. 
 We intend to regain compliance with the NYSE listing standards by pursuing measures that are in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. There is no assurance that our efforts will be successful, nor is there any assurance that we will regain compliance with Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual or remain in compliance with such section or other NYSE continued listing standards in the future. A delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of us; and causing us reputational harm with investors, our employees, and parties conducting business with us.
