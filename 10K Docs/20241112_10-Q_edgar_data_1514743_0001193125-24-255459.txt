period and have attained the age of ). The ESOP borrowed funds from the Company in an amount sufficient to purchase shares (approximately of the common stock issued in the stock offering). The loan is secured by the shares purchased and will be repaid by the ESOP with funds from contributions made by the Association and dividends received by the ESOP. Contributions will be applied to repay interest on the loan first, and then the remainder will be applied to principal. The loan is expected to be repaid over a period of up to years. Shares purchased with the loan proceeds are held in a suspense account for allocation among participants as the loan is repaid. Contributions to the ESOP and shares released from the suspense account are allocated among participants in proportion to their compensation, relative to total compensation of all active participants. Participants will vest in their accrued benefits under the employee stock ownership plan after six
 vesting years, with prorated vesting in years two
 through five
. Vesting is accelerated upon retirement, death or disability of the participant or a change in control of the Association. Forfeitures will be reallocated to remaining plan participants. Benefits may be payable upon retirement, death, disability, separation from service, or termination of the ESOP. Since the Association s annual contributions are discretionary, benefits payable under the ESOP cannot be estimated. Participants receive the shares at the end of employment.

 The IF Bancorp, Inc. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Incentive Plan was approved by stockholders in 2012 for a ten-year
 period which ended in November 2022. The purpose of the Equity Incentive Plan was to promote the long-term financial success of the Company and its Subsidiaries by providing a means to attract, retain and reward individuals who contribute to such success and to further align their interests with those of the Company s stockholders. The Equity Incentive Plan authorized the issuance or delivery to participants of up to shares of the Company common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and non-qualified
 stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, provided that the maximum number of shares of Company common stock that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options) was and the maximum number of shares of Company stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units was . This plan was replaced by the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan when the stockholders approved the new plan on November 21, 2022. The new plan authorizes the issuance or delivery to participants of up to shares of the Company common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and non-qualified
 stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, provided that the maximum number of shares of Company common stock that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options) was and the maximum number of shares of Company stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units was . 
 On December 10, 2013, shares of restricted stock and in stock options were awarded to senior officers and directors of the Association. These shares of restricted stock vested in equal installments over years and the stock options vested in equal installments over years. Vesting of both the restricted stock and options started in December 2014, and were fully vested in December 2023. On December 10, 2015, shares of restricted stock were awarded to senior officers and directors of the Association. These shares of restricted stock vest in equal installments over years, starting in December 2016, and were fully vested in December 2023. On September 9, 2022, shares of restricted stock were awarded to senior officers and directors of the Association. These shares of restricted stock will vest in equal installments over 5 years, starting in September 2023. shares have been granted from the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan as of September 30, 2024, so there are shares of restricted stock and stock option shares available for future grants under this plan. 

stock options were outstanding at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, while stock options were outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2023. stock options were granted or vested during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Balance, September 30, 2024

The fair value of the restricted stock awards is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period and is based on the market price of the Company s common stock at the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares granted that are expected to vest. At the date of grant the par value of the shares granted was recorded in equity as a credit to common stock and a debit to paid-in
 capital. Stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefit for restricted stock, which was recognized in non-interest
 expense, was and , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and was and , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Unrecognized compensation expense for non-vested
 restricted stock awards was and is expected to be recognized over years with a corresponding credit to paid-in
 capital.

Available for sale securities AFS ), which include any security for which the Company has no immediate plan to sell but which may be sold in the future, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders equity. All securities have been classified as available for sale. 
 Premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized or accreted as adjustments to income over the estimated life of the security using the level yield method or to the earlier of call or maturity date. Realized gains or losses on the sale of securities is based on the specific identification method. The fair value of securities is based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. 
 For AFS securities with fair value less than amortized cost that management has no intent to sell and believes that it more likely than not will not be required to sell prior to recovery, only the credit loss component of the impairment is recognized in earnings, while the noncredit loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security as projected based on cash flow projections, and is recorded to the allowance for credit losses (ACL) on investments, by a charge to provision for credit losses. Accrued interest receivable

, or ,000, is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Both the ACL and the adjustment to net income may be reversed if conditions change. However, if the Company intends to sell an impaired AFS security, or, if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell such a security before recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment amount would be recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security s amortized cost basis. Because the security s amortized cost basis is adjusted to fair value, there would be no ACL in this situation.

 The carrying value of securities sold under agreement to repurchase amounted to million at September 30, 2024 and million at June 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, all million of our repurchase agreements had an overnight maturity, and all were secured by U.S. Government, federal agency and GSE securities. The right of offset for a repurchase agreement resembles a secured borrowing, whereby the collateral pledged by the Company would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the Company be in default. The collateral is held by the Company in a segregated custodial account. In the event the collateral fair value falls below stipulated levels, the Company will pledge additional securities. The Company closely monitors collateral levels to ensure adequate levels are maintained. 
 Gross gains of ,000 and and gross losses of ,000 and resulting from sales of available-for-sale

The Company had loans held for sale included in one-
 to four-family real estate loans as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 
 The Company believes that sound loans are a necessary and desirable means of employing funds available for investment. Recognizing the Company s obligations to its depositors and to the communities it serves, authorized personnel are expected to seek to develop and make sound, profitable loans that resources permit and that opportunity affords. The Company maintains lending policies and procedures in place designed to focus our lending efforts on the types, locations, and duration of loans most appropriate for our business model and markets. The Company s principal lending activity is the origination of one-
 to four-family residential mortgage loans but also includes multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity lines of credits, commercial business loans, consumer (consisting primarily of automobile loans), and, to a much lesser extent, construction loans and land loans. The primary lending market includes the Illinois counties of Vermilion, Iroquois, Champaign and Kankakee, as well as the adjacent counties in Illinois and Indiana. The Company also has a loan production office in Osage Beach, Missouri, which serves the Missouri counties of Camden, Miller, and Morgan. Generally, loans are collateralized by assets, primarily real estate, of the borrowers and guaranteed by individuals. The loans are expected to be repaid from cash flows of the borrowers or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers. 
 Management reviews and approves the Company s lending policies and procedures on a routine basis. Management routinely (at least quarterly) reviews our allowance for credit losses and reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing
 and potential problem loans. Our underwriting standards are designed to encourage relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Relationship banking implies a primary banking relationship with the borrower that includes, at a minimum, an active deposit banking relationship in addition to the lending relationship. The integrity and character of the borrower are significant factors in our loan underwriting. As a part of underwriting, tangible positive or negative evidence of the borrower s integrity and character are sought out. Additional significant underwriting factors beyond location, duration, the sound and profitable cash flow basis underlying the loan and the borrower s character are the quality of the borrower s financial history, the liquidity of the underlying collateral and the reliability of the valuation of the underlying collateral. 
 The Company s policies and loan approval limits are established by the Board of Directors. The structure of the Company s loan approval process is based on progressively larger lending authorities granted to loan officers, loan committees, and ultimately the Board of Directors through its Operating Committee, consisting of the Chairman and up to four other Board members. At no time is a borrower s total borrowing relationship to exceed our regulatory lending limit. Loans to related parties, including executive officers and the Company s directors, are reviewed for compliance with regulatory guidelines and the Board of Directors at least annually. 

years or greater. Generally, the Company retains fixed-rate one-
 to four-family residential mortgage loans with terms of less than years, although this has represented a small percentage of the fixed-rate loans originated in recent years due to the favorable long-term rates for borrowers. 
 The Company offers USDA (USDA Rural Development), FHA and VA loans that are originated through a nationwide wholesale lender. 
 In addition, the Company also offers home equity loans that are secured by a second mortgage on the borrower s primary or secondary residence. Home equity loans are generally underwritten using the same criteria used to underwrite one-
 to four-family residential mortgage loans. 
 As one-
 to four-family residential mortgage and home equity loan underwriting are subject to specific regulations, the Company typically underwrites its one-
 to four-family residential mortgage and home equity loans to conform to widely accepted standards. Several factors are considered in underwriting including the value of the underlying real estate and the debt-to-income

 ratio and credit history of the borrower. 
 Commercial Real Estate and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans 

Commercial real estate mortgage loans are primarily secured by owner-occupied businesses, retail rentals, churches, office buildings, and farm loans secured by real estate. In underwriting commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans, the Company considers a number of factors, which include the projected net cash flow to the loan s debt service requirement, the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar properties. Personal guarantees are typically obtained from commercial real estate and multi-family real estate borrowers. In addition, the borrower s financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates. The repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the cash flows of the underlying property. However, the commercial real estate loan generally must be supported by an adequate underlying collateral value. The performance and the value of the underlying property may be adversely affected by economic factors or geographical and/or industry specific factors. These loans are subject to other industry guidelines that are closely monitored by the Company. 

and as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Generally, these loans are collateralized by multi-family and nonresidential properties. The loans are expected to be repaid from cash flows or from proceeds from the sale of the properties of the borrower.

Loan Modifications with Defaults 

The Company had loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in default or in foreclosure as of September 30, 2024 or as of June 30, 2024. The Company defines a default as any loan that becomes days or more past due. 
 Management considers the level of defaults within the various portfolios, as well as the current adverse economic environment and negative outlook in the real estate and collateral markets when evaluating qualitative adjustments used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The Company believes the qualitative adjustments more accurately reflect collateral values considering the sales and economic conditions that the Company has recently observed. 
 The Company may obtain physical possession of real estate collateralizing a residential mortgage loan or home equity loan via foreclosure or in-substance
 repossession. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had foreclosed residential real estate properties as a result of obtaining physical possession.

 As a result of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies were required to develop a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (the ratio of a bank s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than billion. A qualifying community bank that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered well capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The Community Bank Leverage Ratio is currently set at . The Association opted into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio in 2020. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Association met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Association s prompt corrective action category.

Item 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are not historical facts, but rather are statements based on management s current expectations regarding its business strategies and their intended results and IF Bancorp, Inc. s the Company future performance. Forward-looking statements are preceded by terms such as expects, believes, anticipates, intends and similar expressions. Management s ability to predict results or the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors that could have a material adverse effect on our actual results include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, changes in the interest rate environment, legislative or regulatory changes that may adversely affect our business, changes in accounting policies and practices, changes in competition and demand for financial services, adverse changes in the securities markets and changes in the quality or composition of the Association s loan or investment portfolios. Additional factors that may affect our results are discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors , in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, and the Company s other filings with the SEC. These factors should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. IF Bancorp, Inc. assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as may be required by law. Overview On July 7, 2011, we completed our initial public offering of common stock in connection with the Association s mutual-to-stock conversion, selling 4,496,500 shares of common stock at 10.00 per share, including 384,900 shares sold to the Association s employee stock ownership plan, and raising approximately 45.0 million of gross proceeds. We also established a charitable foundation, Iroquois Federal Foundation, to which we contributed 314,755 shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased 1,674,479 shares of common stock under stock repurchase plans. The Company is a savings and loan holding company and is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Company s business activities are limited to oversight of its investment in the Association. The Association is primarily engaged in providing a full range of banking and mortgage services to individual and corporate customers within a 100-mile radius of its locations in Watseka, Danville, Clifton, Hoopeston, Savoy, Champaign, and Bourbonnais, Illinois and Osage Beach, Missouri. The principal activity of the Association s wholly-owned subsidiary, L.C.I. Service Corporation L.C.I. ), is the sale of property and casualty insurance. The Association is subject to regulation by the Office of the Controller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of savings and transaction accounts, certificates of deposit, and Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago advances. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for credit losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income consists primarily of customer service fees, brokerage commission income, insurance commission income, net realized gains on loan sales, mortgage banking income, and income on bank-owned life insurance. Noninterest expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, professional fees, marketing, office supplies, federal deposit insurance premiums, and foreclosed assets. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 
 34 

Our net interest rate spread (the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities) was 1.93 and 1.98 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net interest income increased to 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our emphasis on conservative loan underwriting has historically resulted in relatively low levels of non-performing assets. Our non-performing assets (consisting exclusively of non-performing loans) totaled 201,000 or 0.1 of total loans at September 30, 2024, and 173,000, or 0.1 of total loans at June 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Association was categorized as well capitalized under federal regulations. Our net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 633,000, compared to a net income of 466,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was due to an increase in net interest income and an increase in noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in provision for credit losses. Management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations at and for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Association. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto, appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Critical Accounting Policies We define critical accounting policies as those policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies. Allowance for Credit Losses. The Company believes the allowance for credit losses for loans is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for credit losses for loans represents the best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. An estimate of potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio are determined and an allowance for those losses is established by factors considered by the Company during the evaluation of the overall adequacy of the allowance which include historical net loan losses, the level and composition of nonaccrual, past due and loan modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards or lending practices, lending staff changes, concentrations of credit, industry conditions and the current economic conditions in the region where the Company operates. In addition, a forecast, using reasonable and supportable future conditions, is prepared that is used to estimate expected changes to existing and historical conditions in the current period. The Company utilizes a current expected credit loss CECL methodology which relies on segmenting the loan portfolio into pools with similar risks, tracking the performance of the pools over time, and using the data to determine pool loss experience. Based on our estimate of the level of allowance for credit losses required, we record a provision for credit losses as a charge to earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level. The allowance for credit losses on most loans is measured on a collective (pool) basis for loans with similar risk characteristics. The Company estimates the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for certain collateral-dependent loans by evaluating them individually. The Company also uses the CECL model to calculate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as undrawn amounts on lines of credit. While the allowance for credit losses on loans is reported as a contra-asset asset for loans, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is reported as a liability. The allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and reflects consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are subject to significant revision as more information becomes available. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for credit losses we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results. 
 35 

Income Tax Accounting. The provision for income taxes is based upon income in our condensed consolidated financial statements, rather than amounts reported on our income tax return. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. Under U.S. GAAP, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning our evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, our forecasts of future income, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions. Positive evidence includes the existence of taxes paid in available carryback years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods, while negative evidence includes any cumulative losses in the current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Any required valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The benefit of an uncertain tax position is initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Differences between our position and the position of tax authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or an increase to a tax liability, which could adversely affect our future income tax expense. There were no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30 and June 30, 2024 Total assets increased 5.7 million, or 0.6 , to 893.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 887.7 million at June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an 7.8 million increase in net loans and a 2.2 million increase in investment securities, partially offset by a 1.8 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Net loans receivable increased by 7.8 million, or 1.2 , to 647.1 million at September 30, 2024, from 639.3 million at June 30, 2024. The increase in net loans receivable during this period was due primarily to a 5.1 million, or 2.5 , increase in commercial real estate loans, a 7.1 million, or 7.7 , increase in commercial business loans, and a 68,000, or 0.7 , increase in home equity lines of credit, partially offset by a 2.9 million, or 8.5 , decrease in construction loans, a 929,000, or 0.5 , decrease in one- to four-family mortgage loans, a 125,000, or 0.1 decrease in multi-family loans, and a 541,000, or 7.0 , decrease in consumer loans. Investment securities, consisting entirely of available-for-sale securities, increased 2.2 million, or 1.1 , to 192.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 190.5 million at June 30, 2024. We had no securities held to maturity at September 30, 2024 or June 30, 2024. Between June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024, accrued interest receivable increased 366,000 to 3.8 million, and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock increased 259,000 to 4.8 million, while deferred income taxes decreased 1.9 million to 8.6 million, other assets decreased 1.1 million to 1.6 million and premises and equipment decreased 82,000 to 10.5 million. The increase in accrued interest receivable was the result of increases in both the average balances of loans and the average yields of loans, and the increase in FHLB stock was due to an increased stock ownership requirement due to an increase in FHLB advances. The decrease in deferred income taxes was mostly due to a decrease in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities. The decrease in other assets was mostly due to receipt of previously outstanding receivables, and the decrease in premises and equipment was the result of ordinary depreciation. 
 36 

At September 30, 2024, our investment in bank-owned life insurance was 15.0 million, an increase of 113,000 from 14.9 million at June 30, 2024. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is non-taxable. Federal regulations generally limit our investment in bank-owned life insurance to 25 of our Tier 1 capital plus our allowance for credit losses, which totaled 23.7 million at September 30, 2024. Deposits decreased 50.0 million, or 6.9 , to 677.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 727.2 million at June 30, 2024. Noninterest bearing demand accounts decreased 66.5 million, or 64.3 , to 36.9 million, while certificates of deposit, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, decreased 130,000, or 0.1 , to 290.5 million, savings, NOW, and money market accounts combined increased 22.1 million, or 7.3 , to 326.3 million, and brokered certificates of deposit decreased 5.5 million, or 19.0 , to 23.5 million. The large decrease in noninterest bearing demand accounts was due to approximately 62.7 million in deposits from a public entity that collects real estate taxes that were withdrawn during the three months ended September 30, 2024, when tax monies were distributed. Repurchase agreements increased 141,000, or 0.8 , to 17.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 17.8 million at June 30, 2024. Borrowings consisted of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, which increased 50.5 million to 83.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 33.0 million at June 30, 2024, and borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which decreased 75,000 to 25.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 25.3 million at June 30, 2024. Accrued interest payable decreased 253,000, or 8.4 , to 2.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 3.0 million at June 30, 2024, while advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance decreased 458,000, or 47.3 , to 510,000 at September 30, 2024 from 968,000 at June 30, 2024, allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures increased 5,000 to 103,000 at September 30, 2024 from 98,000 at June 30, 2024, and other liabilities increased 1.1 million, or 26.1 , to 5.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 4.3 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in accrued interest payable was mostly due to a discontinued CD special with a 7-month term and accrued interest payable of 678,000 at June 30, 2024, which matured in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance was attributable to the timing of the payment of real estate taxes and insurance, the increase in the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was due to increases in loans with unfunded balances without the Bank s ability to cancel on demand, and the increase in other liabilities was mostly due to a fluctuation in items in process. Total equity increased 4.8 million, or 6.6 , to 78.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 73.9 million at June 30, 2024. Equity increased primarily due to an increase of 4.8 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, net income of 633,000 and ESOP and stock equity plan activity of 134,000, partially offset by the accrual of approximately 670,000 in dividends to our stockholders. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was primarily due to decrease in unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale securities, net of tax. Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General. Net income increased 167,000 to 633,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 466,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net interest income and an increase in noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expenses and an increase in provision for credit losses. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased by 238,000, or 5.2 , to 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase of 1.6 million in interest income, partially offset by an increase of 1.4 million in interest expense. Our net interest margin increased by one basis point to 2.27 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.26 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, while our interest rate spread decreased by five basis points to 1.93 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.98 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. A 38.1 million, or 4.7 , increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets was partially offset by a 33.25 million, or 4.6 , increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. 
 37 

Interest and Dividend Income. Interest income increased by 1.6 million, or 17.5 , to 10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a 1.7 million increase in interest income on loans, and a 25,000 increase in other interest income, partially offset by a 145,000 decrease in interest income on securities. The increase in interest income on loans resulted from a 72 basis point, or 14.2 , increase in the average yield on loans to 5.83 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 5.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a 44.4 million, or 7.3 , increase in the average balance of loans to 649.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 605.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest on securities decreased 145,000, or 10.2 , as a result of a 22 basis point, or 7.5 , decrease in the average yield on securities to 2.69 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.91 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a 5.7 million, or 2.9 , decrease in the average balance of securities, to 189.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 195.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 1.4 million, or 29.4 , to 6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to both increases in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities and by increases in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by 918,000, or 23.9 , to 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to a 58 basis point, or 24.1 , increase in the average cost of interest bearing deposits to 2.98 for the three months ended September 2024, from 2.40 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a 554,000, or 0.1 increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to 639.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 638.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on borrowings, including FHLB advances, repurchase agreements and other borrowings, increased 466,000, or 53.4 , to 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 873,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to an increase in the average balance of borrowings to 119.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 87.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a 46 basis point increase in the average cost of such borrowings to 4.47 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.01 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Provision (Credit) for Credit Losses. We establish provisions for credit losses, which are charged to operations in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb potential credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. We recorded a provision for credit losses of 382,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which includes a provision for credit losses on loans of 377,000 and a provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures of 5,000, compared to a provision for credit losses of 222,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which includes a provision for credit losses on loans of 310,000 and a credit for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures of 88,000. The allowance for credit losses on loans was 7.5 million, or 1.14 of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.4 million, or 1.20 of total loans at September 30, 2023, and 7.5 million, or 1.16 of total loans, at June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, a net loss of 404,000 was recorded, while during the three months ended September 30, 2023, a net recovery of 1,000 was recorded.

 Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased 280,000, or 24.8 , to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in customer service fees and other income, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking income (loss), net, and net realized loss on sale of available-for-sale securities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, customer service fees increased 24,000 to 125,000, other income increased 450,000 to 761,000, while mortgage banking income (loss), net, decreased 182,000 to a loss of 42,000 and net realized gains (losses) on sale of available-for-sale securities decreased by 71,000 to a loss of 71,000, from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in customer service fees was due to more customer services performed in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the increase in other income was due to the receipt of an insurance settlement filed as a result of HELOC check fraud. The decrease in mortgage banking income (loss), net was a result of a decrease in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and a decrease in loan servicing fees in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in net realized gain (loss) on sale of available-for-sale securities was due to a few securities sold at a net loss in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased 148,000, or 3.1 , to 5.0 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Compensation and benefits increased 52,000, or 1.7 , advertising increased 24,000, or 31.2 , professional services increased 44,000, or 47.8 , and equipment expense increased 33,000, or 6.0 . These increases were partially offset by a 10,000, or 3.5 , decrease in office occupancy, and a 17,000, or 3.8 , decrease in other operating expense. Compensation and benefits increased due to normal salary increases, annual incentive plan increases and increased medical costs, advertising increased primarily due to increased television advertising and community sponsorship in the three months ended September 30, 2024, professional services increased due to additional services received during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and equipment expense increased due to an increase in the cost of core processing. Office occupancy expense decreased due to slight decreases in office building repairs and real estate taxes, and other operating expenses decreased due to a decrease in loan-related expenses. Income Tax Expense . We recorded a provision for income tax of 218,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision for income tax of 175,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting effective tax rates of 25.6 and 27.3 , respectively. Asset Quality At September 30, 2024, our non-accrual loans totaled 163,000, which consisted of one commercial real estate loan in the amount of 142,000 and one consumer loan for 21,000. At September 30, 2024 we had one loan in the amount of 38,000 that was delinquent 90 days or greater and still accruing interest. 
 39 

At September 30, 2024, loans classified as substandard equaled 3.1 million. Loans classified as substandard consisted of 216,000 in one- to four-family loans, 231,000 in multi-family loans, 1.2 million in commercial real estate loans, 1.5 million in commercial business loans and 22,000 in consumer loans. No loans were classified as doubtful or loss at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, watch assets consisted of 66,000 in one- to four-family loans. Loan Modifications with Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty . The Company made no loan modifications for borrowers with financial difficulties in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and two such modifications in the year ended June 30, 2024. One of these modifications was a 252,000 commercial real estate loan, the other was a 133,000 commercial business loan, and both were modified to allow for a payment delay. Foreclosed Assets. At September 30 2024 and June 30, 2024, we had no foreclosed assets. Allowance for Credit Loss Activity The Company regularly reviews its allowance for credit losses and adjusts its balance based on management s analysis of the loan portfolio, the amount of non-performing and classified loans, as well as general economic conditions. Although the Company maintains its allowance for credit losses at a level that it considers sufficient to provide for losses, there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed internal estimates. In addition, the amount of the allowance for credit losses is subject to review by regulatory agencies, which can order the establishment of additional loss provisions. The following table summarizes changes in the allowance for credit losses over the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

The allowance for credit losses has been calculated based upon an evaluation of pertinent factors underlying the various types and quality of the Company s loans. Management considers such factors as the repayment status of a loan, the estimated net fair value of the underlying collateral, the borrower s intent and ability to repay the loan, local economic conditions, and the Company s historical loss ratios. We maintain the allowance for credit losses through the provisions 
 40 

for credit losses that we charge to income. We charge losses on loans against the allowance for credit losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely. The allowance for credit losses decreased 27,000 and was 7.5 million at both September 30, 2024, and at June 30, 2024. This slight decrease in the allowance for credit losses on loans was made to bring the allowance for credit losses on loans to a level that represents the Company s best estimate of the reserve necessary to adequately account for probable losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the loans. Within each pool, risk elements are evaluated that have specific impacts to the borrowers within the pool. These, along with the general risks and events, and the specific lending policies and procedures by loan type, are analyzed to estimate the qualitative factors used to adjust the historical loss rates. Factors considered by the Company during the evaluation of the overall adequacy of the allowance include historical net loan losses, the level and composition of nonaccrual, past due and troubled debt restructurings, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards or lending practices, lending staff changes, concentrations of credit, industry conditions and the current economic conditions in the region where the Company operates. Management reviews economic factors including the potential for reduced cash flow for commercial operating loans from reduction in sales or increased operating costs, decreased occupancy rates for commercial buildings, reduced levels of home sales for commercial land developments, increased operating costs for businesses, and increased levels of unemployment and bankruptcy impacting consumer s ability to pay. Each of these economic uncertainties was taken into consideration in developing the level of the reserve, and management has included a qualitative factor within the ACL. In addition, a forecast, using reasonable and supportable future conditions, is prepared that is used to estimate expected changes to existing and historical conditions in the current period. While management believes that our asset quality remains strong, it recognizes that, due to the continued growth in the loan portfolio and the potential changes in market conditions, our level of nonperforming assets and resulting charge-offs may fluctuate. Higher levels of net charge-offs requiring additional provisions for credit losses could result. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for credit losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan sales and repayments, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, and maturities of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended June 30, 2024, our liquidity ratio averaged 24.3 and 25.9 of our total assets, respectively. We believe that we had enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs as of September 30, 2024. We regularly monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (i) expected loan demand; (ii) expected deposit flows; (iii) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (iv) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short- and medium-term securities. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are affected by our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 7.8 million. Interest-earning time deposits which can offer additional sources of liquidity, totaled 250,000 at September 30, 2024. Our cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows included in our financial statements. Net cash provided by operating activities was 2.2 million and 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the sales, maturities, pay downs of available-for-sale 
 41 

securities, partially offset by disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities. Net cash used in investing activities was (4.0) million and (26.0) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of the activity in deposit accounts, FHLB advances and other borrowings. The net cash provided by financing activities was 90,000 and 27.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company must also maintain adequate levels of liquidity to ensure the availability of funds to satisfy loan commitments. The Company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current commitments principally through the use of current liquid assets and through its borrowing capacity discussed above. The following table summarizes these commitments at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.

 At September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024 totaled 260.4 million, or 38.5 of total deposits. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before September 30, 2025. It is our intention as we continue to grow our commercial real estate portfolio, to emphasize lower cost deposit relationships with these commercial loan customers and thereby replace the higher cost certificates with lower cost deposits. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements, which provide an additional source of funds, exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, Federal Reserve Discount Window, Federal Reserve BTFP, and CIBC Bank USA. At September 30, 2024, our borrowings consisted of 83.5 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances and 25.2 million from the Federal Reserve BTFP. At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow up to an additional 45.6 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, we had 14.0 million available from CIBC Bank, and also had the ability to borrow 35.3 million from the Federal Reserve based on current collateral pledged. The Association is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Association s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Association must meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of the Association s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Association s capital amounts, and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings and other factors. The Basel III regulatory capital framework (the Basel III Capital Rules adopted by U.S. federal regulatory authorities, among other things, (i) establish the capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 ), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments meeting stated requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) set forth the acceptable scope of deductions/adjustments to the specified capital measures. In addition, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity and the buffer applies to all three measurements: Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital. 
 42 

As a result of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies were required to develop a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (the ratio of a bank s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than 10 billion. A qualifying community bank that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered well capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The Community Bank Leverage Ratio is currently set at 9 . The Association opted into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio in 2020. As of September 30, 2024, the Association met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Association s prompt corrective action category. The Association s Community Bank Leverage Ratio is presented in the table below.

 Average Balances and Yields The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information at and for the periods indicated. Yields and costs are annualized. Tax-equivalent yield adjustments have not been made for tax-exempt securities. All average balances are based on month-end balances, which management deems to be representative of the operations of the Company. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.
