 operating leases related to the office spaces located in (i) Dorfstrasse 29, 6300, Zug, Switzerland (comprised of leases), (ii) 95 Regent Street, CB2 1AW, Cambridge, England, United Kingdom, and (iii) Rua Manuel Pinto de Azedevo 860, 4150-335, Porto, Portugal (comprised of leases). The operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term commencing on the date the Company has the right to use the leased property. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term, determined using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. Because the rate implicit in the leases is not readily determinable, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate, which approximates the interest rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments and in similar economic environments. 
 
 Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less that do not have the option to purchase the underlying asset are not recorded on the balance sheet, with lease expense for these leases recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term commencing on the date the Company has the right to use the leased property.

 MoonLake AG - Restricted Founder Shares 
 On April 28, 2021, the shareholders agreement between the co-founders, the Series A investors and MoonLake AG imposed a reverse vesting condition on of the total Common Shares (the equivalent of Class C Ordinary Shares) held by each of the co-founders. Therefore, Common Shares (the equivalent of Class C Ordinary Shares) held by each of the co-founders were subject to these restrictions and considered unvested (the Restricted Founder Shares ). The Restricted Founder Shares vested on the 28th of each month at a rate of over a period of until April 28, 2023. In the event of termination of the contractual relationship of the relevant co-founder before the end of the vesting period, MoonLake AG in first priority, or any third party designated by it, and the other shareholders in second priority pro rata to their shareholdings, had an option to purchase all or a pro rata portion of the leaver shares that remained unvested on the effective day of the termination at nominal value of CHF .

The Company is not aware of any items that would cause the quarterly ETR to be significantly different from the Company's annual ETR. The difference between the income tax provision that would be derived by applying the statutory rate to the Company's loss before income taxes and the income tax provision recorded was primarily attributable to the change in the valuation allowance. The Company continues to incur losses for the entities domiciled in the Cayman Island and Switzerland, and its ability to utilize the deferred tax asset related to the tax losses is not considered more likely than not. A full valuation allowance has been recorded against the deferred tax asset.

Overview 
 
 We are a clinical stage biotechnology company advancing therapies to address significant unmet needs in inflammatory skin and joint diseases. We are currently a single asset company focused on the development of SLK, a novel tri-specific IL-17A and IL-17F inhibiting Nanobody, that we exclusively licensed from MHKDG and that has the potential, based on response levels seen in clinical trials, to drive disease modification in dermatology and rheumatology patients. 
 
 SLK is a proprietary Nanobody that was discovered by Ablynx N.V., Belgium, a Sanofi company Ablynx ), and previously studied by MHKDG and Avillion LLP under a 2017 co-development agreement. The terms Nanobody and Nanobodies used herewith are registered trademarks of Ablynx. Nanobodies are able to bind selectively to a specific antigen with high affinity. Nanobodies have a fraction of the molecular weight compared to traditional antibodies. They offer a number of potential advantages over traditional monoclonal antibodies, including the potential to create multivalent molecules with enhanced ability to penetrate inflamed tissue, especially when containing an additional albumin binding domain such as SLK, an easier manufacturing process and a higher thermostability. 
 
 We currently develop SLK in inflammatory diseases in dermatology and rheumatology where the pathophysiology is known to be driven by IL-17A and IL-17F. This group of diseases comprises our current target diseases, hidradenitis suppurativa HS ), psoriatic arthritis PsA ), axial spondyloarthritis axSpA ), palmoplantar pustulosis PPP ), and several other inflammatory conditions, including psoriasis PsO ). Our current target diseases affect millions of people worldwide, and we believe there is a need for improved treatment options. We believe that SLK has a differentiated mechanism of action and that its purposefully designed molecular characteristics, including its small size and its albumin binding site, facilitate deep tissue penetration in the skin and joints. We envision SLK as a key therapeutic alternative in our initial target indications and potentially in multiple other IL-17 driven inflammatory conditions. 
 
 In May 2022, we initiated a Phase 2b trial of SLK in patients with moderate-to-severe HS (the MIRA trial (M1095-HS-201)), and in June 2023, we announced positive top-line results from this trial, which met its primary endpoint of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response HiSCR 75. In October 2023, we announced positive 24-week top-line results showing that the maintenance treatment with SLK led to further improvements in HiSCR75 response rates and other clinically relevant outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe HS. In February 2024, we announced the successful outcome of our end-of-Phase 2 interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ), as well as positive feedback from our interactions with the E.U. European Medicines Agency EMA ), with both regulatory bodies unanimously supporting our proposed approach for advancing our Phase 3 program of SLK in HS. In May 2024, we announced the screening of the first patients in our Phase 3 program of SLK in HS. 
 
 In December 2022, we initiated a Phase 2b trial in patients with active PsA (the ARGO trial (M1095-PSA-201)), and in November 2023, we announced positive top-line results from this trial, which met its primary endpoint of American College of Rheumatology ACR 50. In March 2024, we announced positive 24-week data from the ARGO trial in PsA showing that continued treatment with SLK led to significant improvements across all key outcomes. In June 2024, we announced the successful outcome of our end-of-Phase 2 interactions with the FDA, as well as positive feedback from our interactions with the EMA, with both regulatory bodies unanimously supporting our proposed approach for advancing our Phase 3 program of SLK in PsA. We expect enrollment of first patients in our Phase 3 clinical trials to commence imminently. 
 
 In March 2024, we announced plans to commence an additional Phase 3 clinical trial of SLK in juvenile HS, and Phase 2 clinical trials in PPP and axSpA. We expect these trials to commence around year-end. 
 
 SLK was also studied in a Phase 2b trial in PsO patients where it showed a significant improvement in the primary end point as compared with placebo and for which results were presented in peer-reviewed scientific publications and conferences. In addition to the three Phase 2b trials, Phase 1 single ascending and multiple ascending dosing trials were previously completed, bringing the total number of patients in completed SLK-related trials to more than 700. 
 
 28 

We do not have any product candidates approved for commercial sale, and we have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our ability to generate revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of SLK in one or more indications, which we expect to take a number of years. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next three years as we continue the development of SLK and prepare for commercial launches. It is expected that operating losses will fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on the timing of our planned clinical development programs and efforts to achieve regulatory approval. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 375.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, together amounting to 493.9 million, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements until the end of 2026. 

Equity Offerings 
 At-the-Market Offerings 
 On May 11, 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the May 2023 Sales Agreement with Leerink Partners LLC (formerly known as SVB Securities LLC) Leerink Partners ), through which we could issue and sell up to 200,000,000 of our Class A Ordinary Shares (the May 2023 ATM Shares ), through Leerink Partners as sales agent. The May 2023 ATM Shares to be sold under the May 2023 Sales Agreement, if any, would be issued and sold pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-271546), which was declared effective by the SEC on May 9, 2023, and a prospectus supplement thereto filed with the SEC on May 11, 2023. 
 
 On June 27, 2023, we reduced the maximum aggregate offering amount of our Class A Ordinary Shares that could be issued and sold under the May 2023 Sales Agreement to 0 and no longer intend to sell Class A Ordinary Shares under the May 2023 Sales Agreement unless we file a further prospectus supplement indicating an amount of shares proposed to be sold. 
 
 On August 31, 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Leerink Partners (the August 2023 Sales Agreement and together with the May 2023 Sales Agreement, the Sales Agreements ), through which we could issue and sell up to 350,000,000 of our Class A Ordinary Shares (the August 2023 ATM Shares ), through Leerink Partners as sales agent. The August 2023 ATM Shares to be sold under the August 2023 Sales Agreement, if any, would be issued and sold pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-274286), which was declared effective by the SEC on September 11, 2023, and a prospectus supplement thereto filed with the SEC on August 31, 2023. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 1,070,818 Class A Ordinary Shares through the Sales Agreements for net proceeds of 46 million, after deducting sales agent's commission and transaction costs. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, we sold 914,828 Class A Ordinary Shares under the August 2023 Sales Agreement at a weighted average share price of 58.31, for aggregate net proceeds of approximately 52.5 million. In the three months ended June 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no sales under the August 2023 Sales Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the total number of shares sold under the August 2023 ATM Sales Agreement was 1,440,752 for total net proceeds of 83.7 million. 
 
 Public Offering of Class A Ordinary Shares 
 On June 27, 2023, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Leerink Partners and Guggenheim Securities LLC as the representatives of the underwriters named therein to issue and sell 8,000,000 Class A Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of 50.00 per share (the Offering ). In addition, we granted the underwriters an option for a period of 30 days to purchase up to an additional 1,200,000 Class A Ordinary Shares at the public offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions (the Option ), and such Option was exercised in full by the underwriters. 
 
 29 

The Offering closed on June 30, 2023, and net proceeds from the Offering, including proceeds from the exercise in full by the underwriters of the Option, were 436.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses in the amount of 23.3 million. 
 
 Following the completion of the Offering, we opted to direct a substantial portion of the net proceeds to MoonLake AG. This was executed as a two-step process: (1) we acquired the remaining 22,756 shares of MoonLake AG common stock held in treasury through a share purchase and assignment agreement formally executed on July 09, 2023 38.9 million) and (2) additional funds were contributed to MoonLake AG s capital reserves through a cash contribution agreement formally executed on July 10, 2023 275 million). A stamp duty tax of 2.8 million was levied on the aforementioned capital contribution which the Company has classified as cash flows from financing activities in order to correctly mirror the underlying nature of the transaction. 
 
 On March 8, 2024, we executed a similar transaction as a two-step process: (i) we acquired 501 Moonlake AG Common Shares held in treasury through a share purchase and assignment agreement 0.8 million) and (ii) we contributed an additional 150.0 million of funds to MoonLake AG's capital reserves through a cash contribution. A stamp duty tax of 1.6 million was levied on the capital contribution which we have classified as cash flows from financing activities in order to correctly mirror the underlying nature of the transaction. The aforementioned increase in treasury shares occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as a result of an employee termination entitling MoonLake AG to repurchase such employee's unvested shares (501 MoonLake AG Common Shares and 16,853 Class C Ordinary Shares) previously awarded as part of a share-based compensation program. Since the shares were subsequently sold to MoonLake, the corresponding Class C Ordinary Shares were canceled. 
 
 Options Exercised under the Equity Incentive Plan 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, certain participants exercised their stock options under the Equity Incentive Plan (as defined below) for an aggregate of 17,390 Class A Ordinary Shares and total cash consideration of 91,298. 

Financial Operations Overview 
 
 Revenue 
 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. If our development efforts for SLK are successful and result in regulatory approval or new license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales or milestone payments. However, there can be no assurance as to when we will generate such revenue, if at all. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including third-party license fees and efforts relating to the development of SLK. We expense research and development costs as incurred, which include: 
 employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation, and other related costs for those employees involved in research and development efforts; 
 external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with Clinical Research Organizations CROs as well as consultants that conduct our research program and development services; 
 costs incurred under collaboration agreements; 
 costs related to manufacturing material for our research program and clinical studies; 
 costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and 
 30 

facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, utilities and insurance. 
 
 We estimate research and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions, CROs, and Clinical Manufacturing Organizations CMOs that conduct and manage research studies and clinical trials on our behalf based on actual time and expenses incurred by them or probable achievement of milestone events that are associated with contractually agreed milestone payments. 
 
 We account for advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the services have been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. 
 
 We do not allocate employee costs, facilities costs, including depreciation, or other indirect costs to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily for managing our research program, clinical development, and manufacturing activities. 
 
 The successful development of SLK is highly uncertain. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and manufacturing partnerships for SLK, conduct research activities and potentially expand our pipeline by pursuing additional indications for SLK or including new product candidates in our portfolio. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration, or the completion costs of current or future research studies and clinical trials of SLK due to the inherently unpredictable nature of research activities and clinical development. Clinical development timelines, the probability of success and the development costs can differ materially from expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which indications to pursue and how much funding to direct to each indication on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future research studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments, and our ongoing assessments as to each indication s commercial potential. 
 
 Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of SLK could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with its development. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for SLK. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials or focus on other product candidates. For example, if the FDA, the EMA, or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of SLK s clinical development. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expense G A consists primarily of employee related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation and other related costs for our executive and administrative functions. G A expense also includes professional services, including legal, accounting and audit services and other consulting fees, as well as facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, insurance and other general administrative expenses. 
 
 Based on our strategy, there are a number of factors that we expect will impact the level of research and development expenses, G A expenses, and capital expenditures incurred by the business. 
 
 These factors include: 
 Building the leading efficacy and safety profile of SLK for patients We expect to incur significant research and development expenses, and G A expenses as we: (i) conduct and initiate further clinical trials for SLK including Phase 3 clinical trials in HS, PsA and juvenile HS and Phase 2 clinical trials in PPP and axSpA; (ii) seek regulatory approvals for SLK; (iii) make milestone and commercial payments under the In-License 
 31 

Agreement, dated April 29, 2021, by and between MoonLake AG and MHKDG (the "In-License Agreement") (based on regulatory filing acceptances, first commercial sales, and aggregate annual net sales); (iv) establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize SLK; (v) attract, hire and retain additional clinical, scientific, quality control, and administrative personnel; and (vi) add clinical, operational, financial and management information systems and personnel. 
 Strengthening the differentiation elements for future SLK patients In parallel with our clinical trials, we expect to incur additional research expenditures as we conduct non-clinical research to continue refining our understanding of SLK/nanobody biology and the potential impact in our selected therapeutic indications. 
 Building our manufacturing and commercialization capabilities We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities, and currently have no plans to establish any. We partner with third-party CMOs for both drug substance and finished drug product. We obtain our supplies from these manufacturers based on purchase orders. Therefore, we expect to incur research and development costs for the purchase of our supplies on an as needed basis to conduct our clinical trials. Technology transfers for drug substance and drug product to commercial scale CMOs have already been executed in 2022, but we may pursue additional technology transfers and process improvements. This is designed to allow us to scale up while SLK is in clinical development and advance potential commercial requirements. The improvement of our manufacturing capabilities will be important in driving efficiency, maintaining high standards of quality control, and ensuring that investigators, physicians, and patients have adequate access to our product candidates, if approved. We also plan to further invest in our commercial capabilities. In 2024, we started hiring dedicated personnel to our marketing, access and pricing functions and intend to continue building out this team to prepare for commercial launches of SLK in our target indications. 
 Deepening our intellectual property portfolio to support our nanobody technology and product candidates We expect to continue to incur additional research and development expenditures as we continue extending our global intellectual property portfolio consisting of patents and patent applications, trade secrets, trademarks, and know-how to protect the product candidates developed from our nanobody technology. We plan to expand our intellectual property portfolio as we continue to advance and develop existing product candidates. 
 Licensing/broadening our portfolio We may supplement our current strategy with the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates for clinical development (beyond SLK), rather than discovering such candidates ourselves, which would lead to additional research and development expenses, G A expenses, and capital expenditures. 
 Granting share-based compensation awards and vesting of existing plans We expect to continue to grant awards to selected employees, directors and non-employees pursuant to the MoonLake Immunotherapeutics 2022 Equity Incentive Plan ("Equity Incentive Plan"). Further, we expect to continue to incur share-based compensation charges in connection with the above-mentioned plan and the vesting of awards made under MoonLake AG s Employee Share Participation Plan ESPP ). 
 
 We also expect to incur additional legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses associated with operating as a public company and as we continue to grow our business. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. 
 
 We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to advance the development of SLK in multiple indications, including the above mentioned clinical trials in HS, PsA, juvenile HS, PPP and axSpA, and to submit a Biologics License Application for SLK. Clinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes and is subject to risks described under the heading Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including that our preclinical studies or clinical trials may not be conducted as planned or completed on schedule and may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA, EMA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If we are required to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials of SLK beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are delayed or unable to successfully complete clinical trials of SLK or other testing, or if the results of these trials 
 32 

or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may require additional funding. Moreover, we will require additional capital to commercialize SLK and to discover, develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize any future product candidates, as applicable. We do not have any committed external source of funds. We expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings or product collaborations. Additional capital may not be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms, if at all. The current market environment for small biotechnology companies, like us, and broader macroeconomic factors, including recent and potential future disruptions in access to bank deposits or lending commitments due to bank failures, may preclude us from successfully raising additional capital. 
 
 If we do not raise additional capital, we may not be able to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and we may need to: significantly delay, scale back or discontinue research and discovery efforts and the development or commercialization of SLK or any other product candidates or cease operations altogether; seek strategic alliances for research and development programs when we otherwise would not, or at an earlier stage than we would otherwise desire or on terms less favorable than might otherwise be available; or relinquish, or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or SLK or any other product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. 

Foreign Currency 
 
 Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Balances and transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted as follows: monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenue (if and when earned) and expenses are translated at the daily exchange rate on the respective transaction date. 
 
 Gains or losses from foreign currency translation are included in "other income, net" in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We recognized a foreign currency transaction loss of 26,746 and 125,581 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a foreign currency transaction loss of 557,144 and 276,491, respectively.

The decrease in income of 2.6 million primarily related to an decrease in net unrealized gain in short-term marketable debt securities of 2.5 million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We have no products approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from product sales, and cannot guarantee when or if we will generate any revenue from product sales. 
 
 We expect our expenses and capital requirements to remain consistent with our current spending levels as we continue to: 
 contract with third parties, including CROs and CMOs, to support the planned clinical trials of SLK, including trials in HS, PsA, juvenile HS, PPP and axSpA; 
 conduct other research and development activities related to SLK; 
 36 

prepare for regulatory filing and commercialization of SLK; 
 attract, hire and retain additional management, scientific and administrative personnel; 
 maintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio, including patents, trade secrets and know how; 
 implement operational, financial and management information systems; and 
 continue operating as a public company. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a loss of 74.8 million, which includes non-cash items such as share-based compensation expense, and a cash outflow from operations of 68.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total of 493.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities. Based on our current operating plans, we believe our available cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements until the end of 2026. 
 
 We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next three years, assuming we continue the clinical development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidate under an in-licensing agreement. It is expected that operating losses will fluctuate significantly from year to year due to the timing of clinical development programs, efforts to achieve regulatory approval, and sales and marketing efforts. We will require substantial additional funding to bring our product candidate to market and support our continuing operations. Until such time that we can generate significant revenue from product sales or other sources, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings, or other capital sources, which may include income from collaborations, strategic partnerships, or marketing, distribution, licensing or other strategic arrangements with third parties, or from grants. If we are unable to acquire additional capital or resources, we will be required to modify our operational plans to fund our operating expense requirements. Refer to Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Limited Operating History, Business, Financial Condition, and Results of Operations in our Annual Report for further details related to the risk of raising additional capital to fund our operations. 

Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (68,113,589) (30,433,841) Net cash used in investing activities (58,264,594) (142,051,023) Net cash provided by financing activities 51,161,002 451,285,093 Effect of movements in exchange rates on cash held (295,865) (140,047) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (75,513,046) 278,660,182 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 We did not generate any cash inflows from our operating activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by our use of cash for operating expenses and working capital requirements, and we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operating activities as we invested in clinical research and related development. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 68.1 million and 30.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase of net cash used in operating activities of 37.7 million was primarily driven by the increase in operating loss of 38.7 million and the increase in cash paid for changes in prepaid expenses of 8.4 million. The increases were partially offset by an increase in cash from changes in trade and other payables of 5.7 million and a decrease in cash paid for changes in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 4.2 million. 
 37 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 58.3 million, consisting predominantly of 203.3 million related to the purchase of short-term marketable debt securities, partially offset by 145.4 million in proceeds received from maturities of short-term marketable debt securities with original maturities longer than three months. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 142.1 million, consisting predominantly of 175.7 million related to the purchase of short-term marketable debt securities, partially offset by 33.7 million in proceeds received from maturities of short-term marketable debt securities with original maturities longer than three months. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 51.2 million consisting primarily of 52.5 million in net proceeds from the shares sold under the August 2023 Sales Agreement. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 451.3 million consisting primarily of the net proceeds from the shares sold under the Sales Agreements and in the Offering. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 The following summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other obligations as of September 30, 2024, which we generally expect to satisfy with cash on hand: 
 Total Less than 1 year 1 to 5 Years More than 5 years Purchase obligations (1) 
 145,087,507 107,076,429 38,011,078 Lease commitments (2) 
 3,576,911 1,565,211 2,011,700 Total contractual obligations 148,664,418 108,641,640 40,022,778 
 ____________ 
 (1) Purchase obligations refer to an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company that specifies all significant terms. The figures presented primarily relate to contractual commitments towards contract manufacturing and contract research organizations. 
 (2) We have committed ourselves to five leases, with terms that commenced on November 1, 2021, October 9, 2023, October 13, 2023, January 15, 2024, and September 8, 2024. We have accounted for the office lease arrangements as operating leases under the guidance ASU 2016-02, Leases Topic 842 through the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The future lease commitments relate to the office leases for our headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, Cambridge, United Kingdom, and Porto, Portugal, and reflect minimum payments due. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 A summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates is presented in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report. There were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption, and our assessment, to the extent it has been made, of their potential impact on our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows. 

38 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we have cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities of 493.9 million, which consist primarily of bank deposits, commercial papers and certificates of deposits. The investments in these financial instruments are made in accordance with an investment policy which specifies the categories, allocations and ratings of securities permissible for investment. The primary objective of the investment activities is non-trading related and instead to preserve principal as well as maximizing income received without significantly increasing risk. 
 
 To minimize any inherent market risk, we maintain a diverse and highly liquid portfolio which includes cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment securities available-for-sale in a variety of securities including certificates of deposits and commercial papers, all with various maturity dates. The fair value of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments would not be significantly affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Since they are classified as available-for-sale , no gains or losses are recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are due to credit losses. We have the ability to hold all such investments until maturity. A hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our financial results or financial condition as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 We do not hold or issue derivatives, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) prior to the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

39 

Inherent limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Lastly, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
