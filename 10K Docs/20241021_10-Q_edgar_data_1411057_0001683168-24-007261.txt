A performance obligation is a contractual promise
to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account in the new revenue standard. The contract transaction
price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
Each contract has a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable
from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct. Revenue from contracts that satisfy the criteria for overtime recognition
is recognized as the work progresses. The majority of the Company s revenue is derived from services provided to customers and is
executed typically over a period that is typically between 1 to 12 months, based on evaluation of when these services are rendered. Contracts
will continue to be recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer as services are rendered to customers.
Payments made by customers in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue. 

Our significant payment terms for customer contracts
vary based on the revenue stream. Franchising business clients are required to advance a percentage of the franchise fee upon acceptance
of the contract. These advances, when received, are accounted for as contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently
recognized in revenue when they are earned. Contracts for clinical trials typically provide for progress payments based on the number
of patients seen, with final payments generally due within 30 days upon completion of work or the termination of the contract. Revenue
is recognized when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied. The Company requires advance payments from
its consulting customers and these payments are recorded as contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet until service is performed
and revenue is recognized. These advance payments are not treated as financing components, based upon the guidance in ASC 606-10-32-196-16
and -17, whereby the timing of when services are provided is at the discretion of the customers, or a substantial amount of the consideration
promised by the customer is variable and not in the control of the customer or the Company. 

Contracts for educational services require nonrefundable
payment in advance and are recorded as revenue when received. 

There is no significant financing component to
any contracts.

The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern depends on the successful execution of its operating plan, which includes expanding its operations and raising either debt or
equity financing. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to expand its operations or obtain such financing on satisfactory
terms or at all. If the Company is unsuccessful in these endeavors, it may be required to curtail or cease its operations. 

The accompanying financial statements do not include
any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company is required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring its U.S. deferred
tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of its deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Tax Act did not
give rise to any material impact on the balance sheets and statements of operations due to the Company s historical worldwide loss

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The financial data discussed below are derived
from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of August 31, 2024, which were prepared and presented in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial statements. These financial data are only a summary
and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and related notes contained herein, which more fully present
the Company s financial condition and operations as at that date and with its audited financial statements and notes thereto contained
in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2024. The results set forth in these consolidated financial statements are
not necessarily indicative of the Company s future performance. This item and other parts of this report contain forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in forward-looking
statements. 

Information about the Company 

 The Company, headquartered in Houston, Texas, conducts
clinical trials for Sponsors and CROs and as a Sponsor through Alpha Research Institute and cannabis-related education in classrooms,
seminars and online through Pharmacology University. For detailed information about the Company and its operations, see Description
of Business. 

The Company s fiscal year begins on June
1 in each year and ends on May 31 in the following year. 

Going Concern 

As indicated in Note 3 of the notes to the audited
consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2024, and the report thereon of the Company s independent auditing
firm, there is substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred recurring losses
and recurring negative cash flow from operating activities and has an accumulated deficit, and its ability to continue as a going concern
depends on the successful execution of its operating plan, which includes increasing sales of existing services and introducing new services,
as well as raising either debt or equity financing. 

The Company needs substantial additional capital
to fund its business, including the completion of its business plan and repayment of its debts. No assurance can be given that any additional
capital can be obtained or, if obtained, will be adequate to meet its needs, and the Company may need to take measures to remain a going
concern. If adequate capital cannot be obtained timely and on satisfactory terms, the Company s operations could be materially negatively
impacted, or it could be forced to terminate its operations. 

Overview 

The Company provides educational systems focused
on medical cannabis in the United States and Latin America, as well as worldwide, through online education and services in therapeutic
areas of clinical trials. The Company s operating units and their activities were:
