 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Dollars
in thousands, except per share data) 

The
Company s history of losses requires management to critically assess its ability to continue operating as a going concern. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company incurred net losses to common stockholders of and , respectively.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit and a total stockholders deficit of and , respectively,
and cash of and was used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had of available cash and cash equivalents. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on generating revenue, raising additional equity or debt capital,
reducing losses and improving future cash flows. The Company will continue ongoing capital raise initiatives and has demonstrated previous
success in raising capital to support its operations, including the private placements and debt financings. 

During
the first quarter of 2023, the Company completed the sale of FOXO Life Insurance Company in order to gain access to the cash held as
statutory capital and surplus at FOXO Life Insurance Company, which we used to fund a portion of our operations during 2023. On June
14, 2024 and September 10, 2024, the Company completed the acquisitions of Myrtle and RCHI, respectively, which are more fully discussed
in Note 5. In addition, to fund our operations, we continue to (i) pursue additional avenues to capitalize the Company, (ii) pursue additional
strategic operating companies, and (iii) commercialize our products to generate revenue. 

See
Note 10 for information on promissory notes payable issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Compliance
with NYSE American Continued Listing Requirements 

On
April 17, 2024, the Company received an official notice of noncompliance from the New York Stock Exchange NYSE stating
that it was not in compliance with NYSE American continued listing standards due to the failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Delinquent Report by the filing due date of April 16, 2024 (the Filing
Delinquency ). With the filing of the Delinquent Report and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024,
the Filing Delinquency was cured. 

On
June 10, 2024, the Company received an official notice of noncompliance from NYSE stating that the Company is not in compliance with
NYSE American continued listing standards due to an outstanding balance of listing fees over 180 days old and NYSE provided the Company
until June 7, 2024 to provide payment before the Company would become subject to the noncompliance procedures. The Company failed to
pay the fee by June 7, 2024, which was extended to August 9, 2024. On August 7, 2024, the Company received a letter from NYSE stating
that the Company is back in compliance with the NYSE American continued listed standards pertaining to timely payment of listing fees
set forth in Section 1003(f)(iv) of the NYSE American Company Guide. The letter acknowledged that the Company has paid its outstanding
balance of fees. 

On
July 10, 2024, the Company received an official notice of noncompliance from NYSE stating that the Company is not in compliance with
Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide since it reported stockholders deficit of as of June 30, 2024, and losses from
continuing operations and/or net losses in its three most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2023. The Company is now subject to
the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 1009 of the Company Guide. 

On
June 12, 2023, the Company received an official notice of noncompliance from NYSE Regulation stating that the Company is below compliance
with Section 1003(a)(i) in the NYSE American Company Guide since the Company reported stockholders deficit of at March 31,
2023, and losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2022. As required
by the notice, on July 12, 2023, the Company submitted a compliance plan (the Plan to NYSE advising of actions it has
taken or will take to regain compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards by December 12, 2024, and if NYSE accepts
the Plan, the Company will have until December 12, 2024 to comply with the Plan. Should the Plan not be accepted, NYSE will seek further clarification of the corrective actions. If the Company is unable to comply with the Plan, then it may make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital
and the Company will be delisted in the event it is unable to cure the noncompliance by December 12, 2024. 

Senior
PIK Notes 

On
September 20, 2022, the Company issued to certain investors Senior Promissory Notes (the Senior PIK Notes in an aggregate
principal amount of , each with a maturity date of (the Maturity Date ). Pursuant to the terms of the
Senior PIK Notes, commencing on November 1, 2023, and on each one-month anniversary thereof, the Company is required to pay the holders
of the Senior PIK Notes an equal amount until their outstanding principal balance has been paid in full on the Maturity Date, or, if
earlier, upon acceleration or prepayment of the Senior PIK Notes in accordance with their terms. The Company failed to make the payments
due on November 1, 2023 and on each one-month anniversary thereof, which constitutes an event of default under the Senior PIK Notes.
The Senior PIK Notes and the event of default are more fully discussed in Note 10. On October 18, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment
No. 1 to the Senior PIK Notes (the PIK Notes Amendment No. 1 ). Under the PIK Notes Amendment No.1, which is more fully
discussed in Notes 10 and 17, the Senior PIK Notes will be automatically exchanged for the Company s cumulative convertible redeemable
preferred stock to be designated as Series B Preferred Stock Series B Preferred Stock ), upon receipt of shareholder approval. 

The
Company can provide no assurance that these actions will be successful or that additional sources of financing will be available on
favorable terms, if at all. As such, until additional equity or debt capital is secured and the Company begins generating sufficient
revenue and operating cash flows, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for
the one-year period following the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As a result of the
Company s acquisition of RCHI on September 10, 2024, the Company believes it will be able to fund its operations until the
second quarter of 2025. In any event, if the Company is unable to fund its operations, it will be required to evaluate further
alternatives, which could include further curtailing or suspending its operations, selling the Company, dissolving and liquidating
its assets or seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws. A determination to take any of these actions could occur at a time that
is earlier than when the Company would otherwise exhaust its cash resources. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable
to continue as a going concern.

performance. The primary collection risks relate to patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered

 of the Original Principal Amount (as defined in the Senior PIK Notes) of such holder s Senior PIK Notes, in exchange for
the consent by such holder of Senior PIK Notes to amendments to the Senior Promissory Note Purchase Agreement, dated September 20, 2022,
between the Company and each purchaser of Senior PIK Notes (the PIK Note Purchase Agreement ). 

Pursuant
to the PIK Note Offer to Amend, the Company solicited approval from holders of Senior PIK Notes to amend the PIK Note Purchase Agreement
to permit the following issuances by the Company of its Class A Common Stock and Common Stock Equivalents (as defined in the PIK Note
Purchase Agreement), without prepaying the Senior PIK Notes: (i) the issuance of shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock in

upon the closing of such Public Financing, and (v) the issuance of shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents (as defined in the PIK Note Purchase Agreement) as private placement additional consideration (collectively, the PIK
Note Amendment ). 

The
Company received consents from all Senior PIK Note holders and all required approvals, including stockholder approval, and issued on
a pro rata basis to the holders of the Senior PIK Notes shares of its Class A Common Stock in consideration for the PIK Note
Amendment.

or, if earlier, upon acceleration or prepayment of the Senior PIK Notes in accordance with their terms. The Company failed to make the
payments due on November 1, 2023 and on each one-month anniversary thereof, which constitutes an event of default under the Senior PIK
Notes. As a result of the event of default, the interest rate of the Senior PIK Notes increased from per annum (compounded quarterly
on each December 20, March 20, June 20 and September 20) to per annum (compounded annually and computed on the basis of a 360-day
year). In addition, the holders of the Senior PIK Notes may, among other remedies, accelerate the Maturity Date and declare all indebtedness
under the Senior PIK Notes due and payable at of the outstanding principal balance.

States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Case 1:22-cv-10858-VEC. 

On
November 7, 2023, Smithline and the Company and its subsidiaries entered into the Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which the parties
agreed to resolve and settle all disputes and potential claims which exist or may exist among them, including without limitation those
claims asserted in the Action, as more specifically set forth in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Settlement Agreement.
Upon the execution of the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to jointly dismiss the action without prejudice. 

Pursuant
to the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Smithline the Cash Settlement Payment, payable in full no later
than the date that is the 12-month anniversary of the effective date of the Settlement Agreement (such date, the Settlement Deadline 
and, such period, the Settlement Period ). During the Settlement Period, the Company agreed to pay Smithline out of any
Equity Financing a minimum of of the gross proceeds of each Equity Financing within two business days of the Company s receipt

the foregoing, in the event that the Company has received proceeds from the Strata Purchase Agreement prior to the effective date of
the Settlement Agreement, Smithline will be entitled to a minimum of of the gross proceeds thereof, payment of which to Smithline
would be applied toward the Cash Settlement Payment. 

In

except for those that cover the resale of shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock currently issued or issuable under the Strata
Purchase Agreement dated October 13, 2023. 

In
addition, the parties agreed that after Smithline has received in cash from the Company, in the event the Company registers for
resale shares of its Class A Common Stock, which are not issued or issuable as of the effective date of the Settlement Agreement, for
a selling stockholder other than under the Strata Purchase Agreement, during the Settlement Period, then the Company will be required
to issue Smithline Settlement Shares at the closing price of the Class A Common Stock immediately prior to their issuance, subject to
the authorization of NYSE American if the Class A Common Stock is then traded on such exchange, which Settlement Shares will be included
for resale in such registration statement, provided, however, that the amount of Settlement Shares, if any, when aggregated with other
Settlement Shares, if any, will be reduced to ensure that such aggregate amount will not exceed of the outstanding shares of the
Company s Class A Common Stock as of the date of issuance (subject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends,
stock combinations, and other similar transactions that occur after the date of the Settlement Agreement). Any net proceeds (after taking
into account all brokerage, transfer agent, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the Settlement Shares, if
any) received by Smithline on the sale of the Settlement Shares, if any, will be credited against the Cash Settlement Payment.

satisfaction in full of the Cash Settlement Payment. 

Simultaneous
with the execution of the Settlement Agreement, Smithline and Puritan Partners LLC and the Company entered into a mutual release (the
 Mutual Release ), which will be held in escrow pending notification from counsel for Smithline that 90 calendar days have
elapsed since Smithline has received the Cash Settlement Payment in full. The Mutual Release includes the release of, in addition to
the Company, Jon Sabes, Bespoke Growth Partners, Inc. and Mark Peikin, subject to their satisfaction of the conditions of the Mutual
Release, including delivery of an executed release to counsel for Smithline releasing the Claiming Parties (as defined in the Mutual
Release). Pursuant to the Mutual Release, in the event that the Company files for bankruptcy and the Claiming Parties are not permitted
to retain the Cash Settlement Payment or the net proceeds received on the sale of Settlement Shares, if any, the Mutual Release will
be null and void and void ab initio. Further, in the event that Jon Sabes, Bespoke Growth Partners, Inc., or Mark Peikin commences a
lawsuit or arbitration or otherwise asserts a claim or cause of action against any of the Responding Parties (as defined in the Mutual
Release) or any of the Claiming Parties, or takes any action against or otherwise hinders in any manner the Company s ability to
repay the Claiming Parties the Cash Settlement Payment or deliver and register the Settlement Shares, if any, the release of such person
or entity will be null and void and void ab initio. 

Pursuant
to the Settlement Agreement, without the prior written consent of Smithline, the Company may not (x) pay KR8, including its affiliates,
in cash more than the sum of (A) (i) a month for the first three months after the effective date of the Settlement Agreement and
(ii) more than a month for months 4 to 12 after the effective date of the Settlement Agreement and (B) a royalty for of product
subscriber revenues received by the Company, or (y) make any payment in cash or stock to Jon Sabes until the Cash Settlement Payment

to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 24, 2022, as amended on April 26, 2022, July 6, 2022 and August 12, 2022, by and
among the Company, DWIN Merger Sub Inc., DIAC Sponsor LLC, and Legacy FOXO; provided, however, that the Smithline Assumed Warrant will
be automatically cancelled immediately upon Smithline s receipt of the Cash Settlement Payment in full. Further, due to the fact
that the Company did not pay the Cash Settlement Payment in full prior to the warrant s expiration on February 23, 2024, the Smithline
Assumed Warrant was automatically extended for a year until February 23, 2025, subject to cancellation upon Smithline s receipt
of the Cash Settlement Payment. From the effective date of the Settlement Agreement until the Settlement Deadline, Smithline may not
exercise any of its rights under the Smithline Assumed Warrant so long as the Company continues to comply with the Settlement Agreement.

is focused on commercializing scientific discoveries in health and longevity. A pivotal moment in the field of longevity science came
with the discovery that epigenetics could be used to develop measures of health, including biological aging, according to an article
published in the scientific journal, Nature , in 2014. In recent years, we and other scientists have extended these findings to
assess tobacco, alcohol, blood cell composition, and other health measures based on discovered epigenetic biomarkers. To that end, FOXO
is dedicated to research and development in order to provide data-driven insights based on the numerous health measures that can be determined
through this unique dimension of biology and used to foster optimal health and longevity for both individuals and organizations. We believe
there is value in what these biomarkers will be able to provide to the world. Current testing options can be inaccurate, and piecemeal,
and often require obtaining a blood sample. Epigenetic biomarkers may pave the path for a fully comprehensive, at-home, low-cost test
that could, with other existing testing, offer a much easier, more detailed sense of one s health. 

At
the same time, we believe there exists a significant bottleneck in scientific research and product development using epigenetic data.
Due to the complexity of the data, many scientists are unaware of how to properly process such data or take full advantage of the available
tools. With our experience in bringing to market new tools (both software and hardware) and know-how (our Bioinformatics Services and
analytic consulting), we believe we are well-positioned to help reduce barriers in advancing epigenetic research and the development
of epigenetic-based products. Thus, we have chosen strategically to extend our expertise in epigenetic data processing and analysis to
outside parties in an effort to further accelerate new discoveries. This work not only allows us to generate revenue, but also continue
our work in developing improved ways in processing and analyzing this important data. 

Historically,
we have had two core product offerings related to the commercialization of epigenetic science: the Underwriting Report, 
and the Longevity Report . The Underwriting Report, which has been under development and is currently paused until
we increase our cash resources in order to continue additional research and development, is intended to allow us to leverage a single
assay testing process to generate a panel of impairment scores that could be applied by life insurance underwriters to more efficiently
assess clients during the underwriting process and provide a more personalized risk assessment. The Longevity Report, sales of which
have also been paused as we redevelop and re-strategize around this product, was designed as a customer-facing consumer engagement product
that provides actionable insights based on one s biological age and other epigenetic measures of health and wellness. 

Historically,
we were operationalizing a sales and distribution platform focused on recruiting independent life insurance agents to sell life insurance
with longevity-promoting products such as our Longevity Report. We previously marketed and sold life insurance products underwritten
and issued by third-party carriers through distribution relationships (the MGA Model ). The MGA Model allowed us to appoint
sales agents and producers to sell insurance products for specific carriers and earn commissions on subsequent policy sales. On October
2, 2023, we decided to pause sales of new life insurance products and move existing producers out of the MGA Model hierarchy to further
conserve cash resources and focus resources on FOXO Labs. 

Management,
License and Maintenance Fees Under the KR8 Agreement 

On
October 29, 2023, we entered into a Letter Agreement with KR8 to develop a Direct-to-Consumer APP (iOS and Android) combining its artificial
intelligence AI Machine Learning technology to provide a commercial application of our epigenetic biomarker technology
as a subscription consumer engagement platform. Effective January 12, 2024, the Letter Agreement was replaced by the KR8 Agreement. Our
Interim CEO and Interim CFO each are equity owners of the Licensor. Under the KR8 Agreement, the Licensor granted to us a limited, non-sublicensable,
non-transferable perpetual license to use the Licensor s products to develop, launch and maintain license applications based upon
our epigenetic biomarker technology and software to develop an AI machine learning epigenetic APP to enhance health, wellness and longevity.
The territory of the agreement is solely within the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Recent
Developments 

Stock
Exchange Agreements Dated June 10, 2024 

On
June 10, 2024, we entered into two stock exchange agreements, each with RHI. 

The
first agreement, as supplemented, (the Myrtle Agreement ), provided for RHI to exchange all of its equity interest in Myrtle
for 500, payable in a combination of shares of our Class A Common Stock and a note payable. The closing occurred on June 14, 2024. 

Myrtle
was formed in the second quarter of 2022 to pursue opportunities in the behavioral health sector, including substance abuse treatment.
initially in rural markets. Services are provided on either an inpatient, residential basis or an outpatient basis. 

On
August 10, 2023, Myrtle was granted a license by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services of Tennessee to operate
an alcohol and drug treatment facility in Oneida, Tennessee. The facility, which is located at BSF s campus, commenced operations
and began accepting patients on August 14, 2023. The facility offers alcohol and drug residential detoxification and residential rehabilitation
treatment services for up to 30 inpatients. On November 1, 2023, Myrtle began accepting patients at its Nonresidential Office-Based Opiate
Treatment Facility OBOT ). The OBOT is located adjacent to Myrtle s alcohol and drug treatment facility in Oneida,
Tennessee and complements the existing residential rehabilitation and detoxification services offered at Myrtle. 

Myrtle
has been granted two licenses from the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, effective August 1, 2024,
for 12 months. The first license authorizes the provision of services for alcohol and drug residential detoxification treatment, as well
as alcohol and drug residential rehabilitation treatment. The second license authorizes the provision of services for non-residential
office-based opiate treatment. Myrtle has also entered into in-network contracts with a number of commercial payers in the second and
third quarters 2024. 

Acquisition
of RCHI and Its Subsidiary SCCH Under the Second Stock Exchange Agreement with RHI, as Amended and Restated 

On
June 10, 2024, the Company entered into the Second Stock Exchange Agreement (the RCHI SEA with RCHI and RHI. On September
10, 2024, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Stock Exchange Agreement with RCHI and RHI (the RCHI SEA Amendment pursuant to which the RCHI SEA was amended to change the consideration to be received by RHI in exchange for all of the equity interests
of RCHI from 20,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company to a senior note in the principal amount of 22,000 (subject to
adjustments) (the September 10, 2024 Note ). 

RCHI s
wholly-owed subsidiary, SCCH, is doing business as BSF. BSF is a critical access care hospital located in Oneida, Tennessee consisting
of a 52,000-square foot hospital building and 6,300-square foot professional building on approximately 4.3 acres. BSF has 25 inpatient
beds, and 24/7 emergency department and provides ancillary services, including laboratory, radiology, respiratory and pharmacy services.
The hospital became operational on August 8, 2017 and it became designated as a Critical Access Hospital (rural) hospital in December
2021, retroactive to June 30, 2021. 

FOXO
acquired Myrtle and RCHI as synergistic opportunities to expand its operations into the healthcare sector and as a complement to its
epigenetic biomarkers of human health, wellness and aging. 

Also
see Note 18 of the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements for other recent developments.

Segments 

We
manage and classify our business into two reportable business segments: (i) Healthcare; and (ii) Labs and Life. Previously, Labs and
Life were treated as separate segments, however, with the acquisition of Myrtle, our operational focus shifted such that it was appropriate
to combine our Labs and Life segments and to operate Myrtle and RCHI under our newly formed Healthcare segment. 

Healthcare
 - The Company s healthcare segment began with the acquisition of Myrtle on June 14, 2024 and expanded with the acquisition of
 RCHI on September 10, 2024, as more fully discussed in Note 5 to the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. Myrtle
 offers substance abuse treatments and services that are provided on either an inpatient, residential basis or an outpatient basis.
 Presently, it offers alcohol and drug residential detoxification and residential rehabilitation treatment services for up to 30
 inpatients. RCHI s hospital, BSF, has 25 inpatient beds, and a 24/7 emergency department and provides ancillary services,
 including laboratory, radiology, respiratory and pharmacy services. BSF is designated as a Critical Access Hospital (rural)
 hospital. 

Labs
 and Life- Our Labs and Life segment is commercializing proprietary epigenetic biomarker technology to be used for underwriting risk
 classification in the global life insurance industry. Our research demonstrates that epigenetic biomarkers, collected from saliva
 or blood, provide meaningful measures of health and lifestyle factors. Labs and Life anticipates recognizing revenue related to sales
 of its Bioinformatics Services and from the commercialization of research and development activities, which may include its Underwriting
 Report, Longevity Report, or as a result of other commercialization opportunities including a potential AI platform for the delivery
 of health and well-being data-driven insights to individuals, healthcare professionals and third-party service providers. Life sought
 to redefine the relationship between consumers and insurers by combining life insurance with healthy longevity. The distribution
 of insurance products that may be paired with our FOXO s Longevity Report strived to provide life insurance consumers with
 valuable information and insights about their individual health and wellness. 

Healthcare
generates revenues from hospital and auxiliary services as well as substance abuse treatments, including inpatient and outpatient services.
Labs currently recognizes revenue from providing epigenetic testing services and collecting a royalty from Illumina, Inc. related to
the sales of the Infinium Mouse Methylation Array. Life primarily had residual commission revenues from its legacy insurance agency business. 

Labs
conducts research and development, and such costs are recorded within research and development expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations. Labs had operated its Bioinformatics Services as an ancillary offering, with revenue recognized as epigenetic
biomarker services in our historical financial statements, but now looks to it as a primary offering. Bioinformatics Services provide
a data processing, quality checking, and data analysis service using FOXO s cloud-based bioinformatics pipeline, referred to as
our epigenetics, longevity, or methylation pipeline in our historical financial statements. Labs accepts raw data from third party labs
and converts that data into usable values for customers 

FOXO
Life Insurance Company 

Due
to market conditions, our capitalization following the Business Combination did not materialize in the way the Company anticipated, and
we did not possess the funding that we believed would be required to satisfy state regulations and regulatory bodies to issue new life
insurance policies through FOXO Life Insurance Company. As such, we decided to not move forward with the launch of FOXO Life Insurance
Company. Accordingly, on February 3, 2023, we consummated the sale of FOXO Life Insurance Company to Security National pursuant to the
Security National Merger Agreement. As a result of the merger, we were no longer required to hold cash and cash equivalents required
to be held as statutory capital and surplus, as required under the Arkansas Insurance Code (the Arkansas Code ). 

At
the closing, all of FOXO Life Insurance s shares were cancelled and retired and ceased to exist in exchange of an amount equal
to FOXO Life Insurance s statutory capital and surplus amount of 5,002 as of the closing date, minus 200 (the Merger Consideration ). 

After
the Merger Consideration and Security National s third-party expenses, the transaction resulted in the Company gaining access to
 4,751 that was previously held as statutory capital and surplus pursuant to the Arkansas Code.

Net
Revenues. Total revenues were 1,196 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023, an increase of 1,186. Myrtle, acquired on June 14, 2024, and RCHI, acquired on September 10, 2024, contributed 1,188
of the increase, partially offset by the decrease in Labs and Life revenues of 2. 

Direct
Costs of Revenues. Direct costs of revenues were 541 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 70 of direct
costs of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted from the direct costs of Myrtle and RCHI, which
were acquired on June 14, 2024 and September 10, 2024, respectively. 

Research
and Development. Research and development expenses were 43 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 283
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by lower employee-related expenses and professional services as well as research and development projects that are
no longer ongoing, which also contributed to the period over period decrease in research and development expenses. 

Management
Contingent Share Plan. Forfeitures under the Management Contingent Share Plan resulted in a net reduction of expense of 116
for the three months September 30, 2024 compared to a net reduction of expense of 1,553 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
The change is driven by more forfeitures of these awards in the 2023 period as a result of more employee layoffs and departures in 2023. 

39 

Selling,
General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 1,733 for the three months ended September
30, 2024 compared to 4,717 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We attribute the decrease of 2,984, or 63 , to
lower: employee related expenses due to headcount reductions, legal fees and insurance expense,
among other items. Partially offsetting the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses were expenses of
 326 associated with Myrtle, which was acquired on June 14, 2024 and 3 03 associated with RCHI, which was
acquired on September 10, 2024. 

Non-operating
Expense. Non-operating expense was 948 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 153 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily related to a 809 increase of interest expense. 

Net
Loss Attributable to FOXO. Net loss attributable to FOXO was 1,946 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an improvement
of 1,714 or 47 compared to net loss of 3,660 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss was primarily
related to the decrease in the loss from operations of 2,502, partially offset by an increase in other non-operating expenses of 795.
Additionally, deemed dividends of 88 and 912 related to the trigger of the down round provisions of the Smithline Assumed Warrants
was recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The deemed dividends resulted in a net loss to common
stockholders of 2,034 and 4,572 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

were acquired on June 14, 2024 and September 10, 2024, respectively. 

Research
and Development. Research and development expenses were 312 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 925 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by lower employee-related expenses and professional services as well
as research and development projects that are no longer ongoing, which also contributed to the period over period decrease in research
and development expenses. 

Management
Contingent Share Plan. Forfeitures under the Management Contingent Share Plan resulted in a net reduction of expense of 75 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net reduction of expense of 141 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
The change is driven by more forfeitures of these awards in the 2023 period as a result of more employee layoffs and departures in 2023. 

Impairment
of Intangible Assets and Cloud Computing Arrangements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we determined that the
cash flows would no longer support the digital insurance platform, underwriting API, and longevity API and recognized impairment losses
of 1,425, 630, and 578, respectively or 2,633 in total. 

Selling,
General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 4,195 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 compared to 15,052 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 10,857, or 72 , was driven by the completion
of a consulting agreement as we recognized 2,370 less compensation costs associated with the amortization of consulting agreements in
the current period compared to the prior period. Also contributing to the decrease were lower: employee related expenses due to headcount
reductions, legal fees, amortization of intangible assets, insurance expense, software license fees and professional fees, among other items. Partially offsetting the decrease
in selling, general and administrative expenses were expenses of 396 associated with Myrtle, which was acquired on June 14, 2024 and
 303 associated with RCHI, which was acquired on September 10, 2024.

Non-operating
Expense. Non-operating expense was 1,848 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4,088 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily related to the loss from PIK Note Amendment and 2022 Debenture Release of 3,521
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Also, contributing to the decrease was a reduction in the fair value of warrant liability
of 243. Partially offsetting the decrease was an increase of interest expense of 935. 

Net
Loss Attributable to FOXO. Net loss attributable to FOXO was 5,613 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an improvement
of 16,979 or 75 compared to net loss of 22,592 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss was primarily
related to the decrease in the loss from operations of 14,731, and the decrease in other non-operating expenses of 2,240. Additionally,
a deemed dividend of 1,054 related to the trigger of the down round provisions and the extension of the Smithline Assumed Warrants was
recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to deemed dividends of 3,378 related to the Exchange Offer and the trigger
of the down round provisions of the Smithline Assumed Warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The deemed dividends
resulted in net loss to common stockholders of 6,667 and 25,970 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement our financial information presented
in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management periodically uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, as such term is defined
under the rules of the SEC, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP
financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or
includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions, divestitures, gains, losses and
impairments, or items outside of management s control. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measure provides
investors and analysts useful insight into our financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed
in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Further, the
calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other
companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies. 

Other
Operating Data (Adjusted EBITDA): 

We
use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered an alternative
to net income as determined by U.S. GAAP, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. We
believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance and provides useful information to investors because it highlights
trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP measures and because it eliminates items that
have less bearing on our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented herein, is a supplemental measure of our performance that
is not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to our U.S. GAAP results
in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of operating
performance that is not defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for net (loss) income as determined in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. 

We
reconcile our non-GAAP financial measure to our net loss, which is its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure to evaluate the profitability and efficiency
of our business mode. Adjusted EBITDA is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

 Adjusted EBITDA provides additional insight into our
underlying, ongoing operating performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of interest income
and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash change in fair value of convertible debentures and warrants, stock-based
compensation, impairment and certain other infrequent and/or unpredictable non-cash charges or benefits. Management believes that presenting
Adjusted EBITDA is more representative of our operational performance and may be more useful for investors.

Sources
of Liquidity and Capital 

We
had cash and cash equivalents of 34 and 38 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We have incurred net
losses since our inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred net losses available to common
stockholders of 6,667 and 25,970, respectively. At September 30, 2024, had a working capital deficit and a total
stockholders deficit of 31,439 and 17,554, respectively. Our operations used cash of 995 and 6,165 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We are expecting the Myrtle and RCHI businesses to be cash flow neutral through the
remainder of 2024. 

Our
current revenue is not adequate to fund our operations in the next twelve months and requires us to fund our business through other avenues
until the time we achieve adequate scale. Securing additional capital is necessary to execute on our business strategy. We are currently negotiating additional funding with multiple sources.

Financing 

During
the third quarter of 2023, we completed two tranches of private placements that provided gross proceeds of 450 and 294. After deducting
placement agent fees and other offering expenses, the net proceeds from the private placements were 260 and 217. 

During
the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into the Strata Purchase Agreement with ClearThink, as supplemented by that certain Supplement
to Strata Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 13, 2023, by and between us and ClearThink. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed
two tranches of private placements under the terms of the Strata Purchase Agreement with ClearThink that provided gross proceeds of 200
and 256. After deducting finder s fees and other offering expenses, the net proceeds from the private placements were of 186
and 246. On August 13, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Strata Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the commitment
amount was increased from 2,000 to 5,000. 

February
1, 2024 Second Strata Purchase Agreement 

On
February 1, 2024, we entered into the Second Strata Purchase Agreement with ClearThink. No shares of the Company s common stock
were issued under the Second Strata Purchase Agreement and on August 8, 2024, the Company and ClearThink entered into a termination agreement
and all outstanding obligations were terminated. 

On
January 3, 2024, we issued to ClearThink a promissory note in the principal amount of 75, less an original issue discount of 25, on
January 30, 2024, we issued to ClearThink a promissory note in the principal amount of up to 750, less an original issue discount of
 250, on May 15, 2024, we issued ClearThink a promissory note in the principal amount of 300 and on August 16, 2024, under the terms
of an extension, the principal balance was increased to 350, the discount was increased to 175 and we agreed to issue ClearThink 100,000
shares of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, on August 16, 2024, we issued ClearThink a promissory note in the principal amount of
 40 and we received proceeds of 27. We received net cash proceeds totaling 656 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from
the issuances of these notes payable. 

On
April 28, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with LGH pursuant to which we issued to LGH a convertible promissory
note in the principal amount of 110 and 200,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock as inducement shares to LGH. We received cash of
 100 from the issuance of the convertible promissory note. 

On
April 30, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with IG pursuant to which we issued IG a promissory note in the principal
amount of 150 and we agreed to issue 100,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock as inducement shares to IG. We received cash of 100
from the issuance of the promissory note. On August 16, 2024, the note was extended to September 30, 2024. Under the extension, we agreed
to increase the principal balance by 25 and to issue IG 50,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock. During the period November 1, 2024 to November 15, 2024, the full principal balance and associated accrued interest
of the IG promissory note of 195 was converted into 415,000 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock. 

Pursuant
to the acquisition of Myrtle, we issued a non-interest bearing note payable to RHI due on December 31, 2024 in the original principal
amount of 1,611. As of September, the principal balance was 707. In addition, we issued a non-interest bearing promissory note due
on demand to RHI in the amount of 265 for a portion of the purchase price of Myrtle. 

On
June 12, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA with an institutional investor (the Purchaser pursuant to which we agreed to issue to the Purchaser and subsequent purchasers who will also be parties to the SPA (the Purchaser, together
with the purchasers, the Purchasers Senior Notes Payable in the aggregate principal amount of up to 2,800. 

The
closings of the SPA (each a Closing, or, together, the Closings are as follows: 

On
 the June 14, 2024, the Purchaser purchased an aggregate of 840 in principal amount of the Senior Note Payable and we received cash
 proceeds of 750. On July 17, 2024, we issued to the Purchaser 1,108,755 shares of our common stock per the terms of the agreement. 

On
 August 1, 2024, the Purchaser purchased an aggregate of 280 in principal amount of the Senior Note Payable and we received cash
 proceeds of 250. 

Upon
 the closing of the acquisition of RCHI, the Purchaser(s) agreed to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,120 in principal amount of the
 Senior Notes Payable. However, the Purchaser or Purchasers have not yet purchased these additional notes due to conditions of the SPA that have not been met. The terms of the
 acquisition of RCHI were amended as more fully discussed in Note 5 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
 statements. 

Upon
 the filing of a registration statement by us with the SEC relating to the resale by the Purchasers (and any affiliates) of all shares
 of Class A Common Stock of the Company beneficially owned by each Purchaser (and any affiliate) the Purchasers have agreed to purchase
 up to an aggregate of 560 in principal amount of the Senior Notes Payable. The Purchaser or Purchasers have not yet purchased these
 notes because the conditions to fund have not yet been fully met. 

44 

On
July 22, 2024, we issued a promissory note to 1800 Diagonal Lending LLC in the principal amount of 169 and we received cash of 125. 

On
September 10, 2024, we issued a note payable due on September 10, 2026 to RHI in the principal amount of 22,000 for the purchase of
RCHI. In addition, we have outstanding the Western Note Payable in the amount of 624, which was owed by RCHI at the time of the acquisition
of RCHI. 

Going
Concern 

Our
primary uses of cash are to fund our operations as we continue to grow our business, as well as to service our debt. We finalized
the acquisition of Myrtle on June 14, 2024 and the acquisition of RCHI on September 10, 2024. We are expecting the Myrtle and RCHI
businesses to be cash flow neutral through the remainder of 2024. Capital expenditures have historically not been material to our
consolidated operations, and we do not anticipate making material capital expenditures in the remainder of 2024 or in 2025. We
expect that our liquidity requirements will continue to consist of working capital, including payments of outstanding debt and
accrued liabilities and general corporate expenses associated with the growth of our business. Based on our current operations, we
do not have sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the date hereof. We expect to address our
liquidity needs through the pursuit of additional funding through a combination of equity or debt financings and additional
strategic acquisitions to enable us to fund our operations. 

We
have taken various actions to bolster our cash position, including raising funds through the private placements and transactions with
ClearThink, LGH, IG, 1800 Diagonal Lending LLC, the Purchaser described above, as well as other lenders, and conserving cash by issuing
shares of our Class A Common Stock under license agreements, legal settlements, consulting agreements, finder s fees related to
equity and debt financing and consulting agreements, among other transactions. We are also looking at conserving cash by issuing shares
of our preferred stock, subject to shareholder approval. 

Based
on our current operating plan, our cash position as of September 30, 2024, and after taking into account the actions described above,
we expect to be able to fund our operations through the second quarter of 2025. Even if our current operating plan is successful, we
expect to need additional financing or other increase in our cash and cash equivalents balance to enable us to fund our future operations. 

We
have based our estimates as to how long we expect we will be able to fund our operations on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and
we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, in which case we would be required to obtain additional
financing sooner than currently projected, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital
as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We may raise
additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources. If we do raise additional capital through public
or private equity offerings, or convertible debt offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and
the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely impact our existing stockholders rights.
If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain
actions.

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash of 995 and 6,164 was used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The improvement
was primarily the result of the 16,979 reduction in the net loss attributable to FOXO, in the nine months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the prior period. The improvement in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by certain noncash
items in the 2023 period, including: (i) the loss from PIK Note Amendment and 2022 Debenture Release of 3,521, (ii) higher amortization of consulting fees paid in common stock of 1,719 and (iii) impairment of assets of 2,633,
among other items. 

Investing
Activities 

Investing
activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 provided cash of 14, which represented the cash acquired from the purchases of
Myrtle and RCHI. No cash was used or provided by investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash of 977 was provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the issuances of promissory notes
of 1,981, partially offset by a payment of the note payable to RHI of 904 and payments under accounts receivable sales agreements of
 100. Cash of 692 was provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, including 744 from private placements,
 247 from the issuance of a related party promissory note, partially offset by 299 of deferred offering costs. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions
that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. 

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or
commitments of other entities, or entered into any non-financial assets.

 facilities lease between RCHI and a subsidiary of RHI beginning June 1, 2024 for a term of one year with annual options
to renew for up to 5 years. Initial monthly base rental amount is 65 and with annual rental increases equal to the greater of 3 and
the consumer price index. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 1. Financial
Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements requires the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the judgments and assumptions on which to
base accounting estimates, which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets, the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual
results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We periodically review our estimates in light
of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate. 

We
define our critical accounting policies and estimates as those that require us to make subjective judgments about matters that are uncertain
and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which
we apply those principles. We believe the critical accounting policy used in the preparation of our financial statements which required
significant estimates and judgments is as follows: 

Going
Concern 

Our
history of losses requires management to critically assess our ability to continue operating as a going concern. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred net losses to common stockholders of 6,667 and 25,970, respectively. As of September
30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit and a total stockholders deficit of 31,439 and 17,554, respectively. Cash of 995
and 6,165 was used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30,
2024, we had 34 of available cash and cash equivalents. 

On
a quarterly basis, we assess going concern uncertainty for our condensed consolidated financial statements to determine if we have sufficient
cash and cash equivalents on hand and working capital to operate for a period of at least one year from the date our condensed consolidated
financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (the look-forward period ). Based on conditions that are known
and reasonably knowable to us, we consider various scenarios, forecasts, projections, and estimates, and we make certain key assumptions,
including the timing and nature of projected cash expenditures or programs, among other factors, and our ability to delay or curtail
those expenditures or programs within the look-forward period, if necessary. Until additional equity or debt capital is secured, and
the Company begins generating sufficient revenue, reducing losses, and improving future cash flows, there is substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will continue ongoing capital raise initiatives and has demonstrated
previous success in raising capital to support its operations. 

47 

During
the first quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of FOXO Life Insurance Company in order to gain access to the cash held as statutory
capital and surplus at FOXO Life Insurance Company, which we used to fund a portion of our operations during 2023. On June 14, 2024 and
September 10, 2024, we completed the acquisitions of Myrtle and RCHI, respectively, which are more fully discussed in Note 5 to the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. While Myrtle is still in the startup phase, RCHI, through its hospital
BSF, is expected to provide us with positive operating cash flows. In addition, to fund our operations, we continue to (i) pursue additional
avenues to capitalize the Company, (ii) pursue additional strategic operating companies, and (iii) commercialize our products to generate
revenue. 

As
previously disclosed, on September 20, 2022, we issued the Senior PIK Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 3,457, each with a maturity
date of April 1, 2024. Pursuant to the terms of the Senior PIK Notes, commencing on November 1, 2023, and on each one-month anniversary
thereof, we are required to pay the holders of the Senior PIK Notes an equal amount until their outstanding principal balance has been
paid in full on the Maturity Date, or, if earlier, upon acceleration or prepayment of the Senior PIK Notes in accordance with their terms.
We failed to make the payments due on November 1, 2023 and on each one-month anniversary thereof, which constitutes an event of default
under the Senior PIK Notes. On October 18, 2024, the Company entered into the PIK Notes Amendment No. 1. Under the PIK Notes Amendment
No.1, which is more fully discussed in Notes 10 and 18 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the
Senior PIK Notes would be exchanged for the Company s Series B Preferred Stock, subject to stockholder approval. 

Compliance
with NYSE American Continued Listing Requirements 

On
April 17, 2024, the Company received an official notice of noncompliance from the New York Stock Exchange NYSE stating
that it was not in compliance with NYSE American continued listing standards due to the failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Delinquent Report by the filing due date of April 16, 2024 (the Filing
Delinquency ). With the filing of the Delinquent Report and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024,
the Filing Delinquency was cured. 

On
June 10, 2024, the Company received an official notice of noncompliance from NYSE stating that the Company is not in compliance with
NYSE American continued listing standards due to an outstanding balance of listing fees over 180 days old and NYSE provided the Company
until June 7, 2024 to provide payment before the Company would become subject to the noncompliance procedures. The Company failed to
pay the fee by June 7, 2024, which was extended to August 9, 2024. On August 7, 2024, the Company received a letter from NYSE stating
that the Company is back in compliance with the NYSE American continued listed standards pertaining to timely payment of listing fees
set forth in Section 1003(f)(iv) of the NYSE American Company Guide. The letter acknowledged that the Company has paid its outstanding
balance of fees. 

On July 10, 2024, the Company received an official notice of noncompliance from NYSE stating that the Company is
not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide since it reported stockholders deficit of 16,167 as of June 30,
2024, and losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its three most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2023. The Company
is now subject to the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 1009 of the Company Guide. 

On
June 12, 2023, the Company received an official notice of noncompliance from NYSE Regulation stating that the Company is below compliance
with Section 1003(a)(i) in the NYSE American Company Guide since the Company reported stockholders deficit of 30 at March 31,
2023, and losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2022. As required
by the notice, on July 12, 2023, the Company submitted a compliance plan (the Plan to NYSE advising of actions it has
taken or will take to regain compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards by December 12, 2024, and if NYSE accepts
the Plan, the Company will have until December 12, 2024 to comply with the Plan. Should the Plan not be accepted, or the Company be unable
to comply with the Plan, then it may make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital and the Company will be delisted in the
event it is unable to cure the noncompliance by December 12, 2024. 

However,
we can provide no assurance that these actions will be successful or that additional sources of financing will be available to us on
favorable terms, if at all. As such, until additional equity or debt capital is secured and we begin generating sufficient revenue, there
is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the one-year period following the issuance
of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As a result of the Company s acquisition of RCHI on September 10, 2024, the Company believes it will be able
to fund its operations until the second quarter of 2025. In any event, if we are unable
to fund our operations we will be required to evaluate further alternatives, which could include further curtailing or suspending operations,
selling the Company, dissolving and liquidating its assets or seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws. A determination to take any
of these actions could occur at a time that is earlier than when we would otherwise exhaust our cash resources. 

48 

Factors
That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations 

Our
results of operations may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial
markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our operations are susceptible to additional risks as a result of our recent acquisitions
of Myrtle and RCHI see Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns
in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions,
declines in consumer confidence and spending, the effects of pandemics, including the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the emergence
of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and Israel. We cannot at this time fully predict
the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our
business.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer (the Certifying Officers ), or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of September 30, 2024. 

Management
became aware of the material weaknesses described above during the preparation of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023. To address the material weaknesses, the Company performed additional analyses and other procedures,
including reviewing the terms of its common stock warrants and the methods used to determine the fair value of its common stock warrants
as presented in its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements at and as of September 30, 2024. However, the material weaknesses
have not been fully remediated as of the filing date of this report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act,
during the Company s quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

We
face many significant risks in our business, some of which are unknown to us and not presently foreseen. These risks could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. In addition to the risk factors set forth
below and the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A,
 Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on June 6, 2024,
all of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. With the acquisitions of Myrtle and RCHI,
we face added risks associated with these businesses as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Our
newly acquired behavioral health facility may not become profitable. 

We
acquired Myrtle from RHI on June 14, 2024. Myrtle was formed in the second quarter of 2022 to pursue opportunities in the behavioral
health sector, initially in rural markets. On August 10, 2023, Myrtle was granted a license by the Department of Mental Health and Substance
Abuse Services of Tennessee to operate an alcohol and drug treatment facility in Oneida Tennessee. The facility, which is located at
the BSF campus, commenced operations and began accepting patients on August 14, 2023. Myrtle offers substance abuse treatments and services
that are provided on either an inpatient, residential basis or an outpatient basis. Presently, it offers alcohol and drug residential
detoxification and residential rehabilitation treatment services for up to 30 inpatients. To date, Myrtle s operations have incurred
losses and generated negative cash flow from operations and there is no assurance that Myrtle s operations will become profitable
in the future, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 

We
have incurred significant debt as a result of the acquisitions of Myrtle and RCHI, portions of which are due on demand. 

We
currently have, and will likely continue to have, a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, we had total debt outstanding
of 31,565, including promissory notes totaling 22,972 that were issued to RHI in connection with the acquisitions of Myrtle and RCHI.
Our indebtedness could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt and other obligations, require us to use
a large portion of our cash flow from operations to repay and service our debt or otherwise create liquidity problems, limit our flexibility
to adjust to market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness
may adversely affect us. 

Our
ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance and capital raising activities, which will be affected by financial,
business, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources prove inadequate to
allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations, including debt covenants, we could face substantial
liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, restructure or refinance our debt, which we may
be unable to do on acceptable terms, and forego attractive business opportunities. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt
agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives. 

Our
results of operations may be adversely affected if the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA is repealed, replaced
or otherwise changed. 

The
ACA has increased the number of people with health care insurance. It also has reduced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Numerous
proposals continue to be discussed to repeal, amend or replace the law. We cannot predict whether any such repeal, amend or replace proposals,
or any parts of them, will become law and, if they do, what their substance or timing will be. There is uncertainty whether, when and
how the ACA may be changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, the timing of enactment and implementation of any alternative
provisions and the impact of any alternative provisions on providers as well as other healthcare industry participants. Efforts to repeal
or change the ACA or implement other initiatives intended to reform healthcare delivery and financial systems may have an adverse effect
on our business and results of operations. 

50 

General
economic conditions. 

Much
healthcare spending is discretionary and can be significantly impacted by economic downturns. When patients are experiencing personal
financial difficulties or have concerns about general economic conditions, they may choose to defer or forego elective surgeries and
other non-emergent procedures, which are generally more profitable lines of business for hospitals. In addition, employers may impose
or patients may select a high-deductible insurance plan or no insurance at all, which increases a hospital s dependence on self-pay
revenue. Moreover, a greater number of uninsured patients may seek care in our emergency rooms. 

We
are unable to quantify the specific impact of current or recent economic conditions on our business, however, we believe that the economic
conditions in the service areas in which our hospitals operate may have an adverse impact on our operations. Such impact can be expected
to continue to affect not only the healthcare decisions of our patients and potential patients but could also have an adverse impact
on the solvency of certain managed care providers and other counterparties to transactions with us. 

Healthcare
plans have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services. 

We
also face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers, including healthcare plans, to reduce utilization and reimbursement for healthcare
services. 

The
healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthcare insurance plans and payers, resulting in fewer but larger
insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers. These healthcare plans, and
independent physician associations, may demand that providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial
risk associated with providing services to their members through capped payment arrangements. There are also an increasing number of
patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing. 

The
increased consolidation among healthcare plans and payers increases the potential adverse impact of not being, or ceasing to be, a contracted
provider with any such insurer. The ACA includes provisions, including ones regarding the creation of healthcare exchanges, which may
encourage healthcare insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting. 

We
expect continuing efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of services. These
efforts, including future changes in third-party payer rules, practices and policies or ceasing to be a contracted provider to many healthcare
plans, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Some
of our operations are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks and other laws designed to prohibit payments
for referrals and eliminate healthcare fraud. 

Federal
and state anti-kickback and similar laws prohibit payment, or offers of payment, in exchange for referrals of products and services for
which reimbursement may be made by Medicare or other federal and state healthcare programs. Some state laws contain similar prohibitions
that apply without regard to the payer of reimbursement for the services. Under a federal statute, known as the Stark Law 
or self-referral prohibition, physicians, subject to certain exceptions, are prohibited from referring their Medicare or
Medicaid program patients to providers with which the physicians or their immediate family members have a financial relationship, and
the providers are prohibited from billing for services rendered in violation of Stark Law referral prohibitions. Violations of the federal
Anti-Kickback Law and Stark Law may be punished by civil and criminal penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health
care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. States may impose similar penalties. The ACA significantly strengthened provisions of
the Federal False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback Law provisions, and other health care fraud provisions, leading to the possibility of
greatly increased qui tam suits by private citizen relators for perceived violations of these laws. There can be
no assurance that our activities will not come under the scrutiny of regulators and other government authorities or that our practices
will not be found to violate applicable laws, rules and regulations or prompt lawsuits by private citizen relators under federal or state
false claims laws. 

51 

Federal
officials responsible for administering and enforcing the healthcare laws and regulations have made a priority of eliminating healthcare
fraud. For example, the ACA includes significant new fraud and abuse measures, including required disclosures of financial arrangements
with physician customers, lower thresholds for violations and increased potential penalties for violations. Federal funding available
for combating health care fraud and abuse generally has increased. While we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations, many of the laws and regulations applicable to our business, particularly those relating to billing and reimbursement
of services and those relating to relationships with physicians, hospitals and patients, contain language that has not been interpreted
by courts. We must rely on our interpretation of these laws and regulations based on the advice of our counsel and regulatory or law
enforcement authorities may not agree with our interpretation of these laws and regulations and may seek to enforce legal remedies or
penalties against us for violations. 

From
time to time we may need to change our operations, particularly pricing or billing practices, in response to changing interpretations
of these laws and regulations, or regulatory or judicial determinations with respect to these laws and regulations. These occurrences,
regardless of their outcome, could damage our reputation and harm important business relationships that we have with healthcare providers,
payers and others. Furthermore, if a regulatory or judicial authority finds that we have not complied with applicable laws and regulations,
we would be required to refund amounts that were billed and collected in violation of such laws and regulations. In addition, we may
voluntarily refund amounts that were alleged to have been billed and collected in violation of applicable laws and regulations. In either
case, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs
and the loss of licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party
claims, all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. 

Moreover,
regardless of the outcome, if we or physicians or other third parties with whom we do business are investigated by a regulatory or law
enforcement authority we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and our management may be required to divert a substantial
amount of time to an investigation. 

To
enhance compliance with applicable health care laws, and mitigate potential liability in the event of noncompliance, regulatory authorities,
such as the OIG, have recommended the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive health care compliance program that generally contains
the elements of an effective compliance and ethics program described in Section 8B2.1 of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines
Manual, and for many years the OIG has made available a model compliance program. In addition, certain states require that health care
providers that engage in substantial business under the state Medicaid program have a compliance program that generally adheres to the
standards set forth in the Model Compliance Program. Also, under the ACA, HHS will require suppliers, such as the Company, to adopt,
as a condition of Medicare participation, compliance programs that meet a core set of requirements. While we have adopted, or are in
the process of adopting, healthcare compliance and ethics programs that generally incorporate the OIG s recommendations, and training
our applicable employees in such compliance, having such a program can be no assurance that we will avoid any compliance issues. 

We
conduct our business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in regulations or violations of regulations could, directly or indirectly,
harm our operating results and financial condition. 

The
healthcare industry is highly regulated and there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change
significantly and adversely in the future. Areas of the regulatory environment that may affect our ability to conduct business include,
without limitation: 

federal
 and state laws applicable to billing and claims payment; 

federal
 and state laws relating to licensure; 

federal
 and state anti-kickback laws; 

federal
 and state false claims laws; 

federal
 and state self-referral and financial inducement laws, including the federal physician anti-self-referral law, or the Stark Law; 

coverage
 and reimbursement levels by Medicare and other governmental payors and private insurers; 

HIPAA,
 along with the revisions to HIPAA as a result of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH ),
 and analogous state laws; 

federal
 and state regulation of privacy, security, electronic transactions and identity theft; 

federal,
 state and local laws governing the handling, transportation and disposal of medical and hazardous waste; 

Occupational
 Safety and Health Administration rules and regulations; 

changes
 to laws, regulations and rules as a result of the ACA; and 

changes
 to other federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules, including tax laws. 

52 

These
laws and regulations are extremely complex and in many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of
these laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated these laws or regulations, or the public announcement that we are
being investigated for possible violations of these laws or regulations, could harm our operating results and financial condition. In
addition, a significant change in any of these laws or regulations may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance
with these laws or regulations, which could harm our operating results and financial condition. 

Failure
to comply with complex federal and state laws and regulations related to submission of claims for services can result in significant
monetary damages and penalties and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

We
are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations relating to the submission of claims for payment for services, including
those that relate to coverage of our services under Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental health care programs, the amounts that
may be billed for our services and to whom claims for services may be submitted. 

Our
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in our inability to receive payment for our services or result in
attempts by third-party payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to recover payments from us that have already been made. Submission of
claims in violation of certain statutory or regulatory requirements can result in penalties, including substantial civil money penalties
for each item or service billed to Medicare in violation of the legal requirement, and exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.
Government authorities may also assert that violations of laws and regulations related to submission or causing the submission of claims
violate the federal False Claims Act FCA or other laws related to fraud and abuse, including submission of claims for
services that were not medically necessary. Violations of the FCA could result in enormous economic liability. The FCA provides that
all damages are trebled. For example, we could be subject to FCA liability if it was determined that the services we provided were not
medically necessary and not reimbursable, particularly if it were asserted that we contributed to the physician s referrals of
unnecessary services to us. It is also possible that the government could attempt to hold us liable under fraud and abuse laws for improper
claims submitted by an entity for services that we performed if we were found to have knowingly participated in the arrangement that
resulted in submission of the improper claims. 

Our
facilities are subject to potential claims for professional liability, including existing or potential claims based on the acts or omissions
of third parties, which claims may not be covered by insurance. 

Our
facilities are subject to potential claims for professional liability in connection with their operations, as well as potentially acquired
or discontinued operations. To cover such claims, professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance are maintained
in amounts believed to be sufficient for operations, although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect. The
assertion of a significant number of claims, either within a self-insured retention (deductible) or individually or in the aggregate
in excess of available insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Premiums
for professional liability insurance have historically been volatile and we cannot assure you that professional liability insurance will
continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The operations of hospitals also depend on the professional services of
physicians and other trained healthcare providers and technicians in the conduct of their respective operations. There can be no assurance
that any legal action stemming from the act or omission of a third party provider of healthcare services would not be brought against
one of our hospitals, resulting in significant legal expenses in order to defend against such legal action or to obtain a financial contribution
from the third party whose acts or omissions occasioned the legal action. 

Our
success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals. A shortage of qualified healthcare professionals
could weaken our ability to deliver healthcare services. 

Our
operations are dependent on the efforts, ability and experience of healthcare professionals, such as physicians, nurses, therapists,
pharmacists and lab technicians. Each facility s success has been, and will continue to be, influenced by its ability to attract
and retain these skilled employees. A shortage of healthcare professionals, the loss of some or all of its key employees or the inability
to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified healthcare professionals could cause the operating performance of one or more of
our facilities to decline. 

53 

Our
operations are dependent on the local economies and the surrounding areas in which they operate and are concentrated in Tennessee. A
significant deterioration in those economies could cause a material adverse effect on our businesses. 

Each
rural facility operation is dependent upon the local economy where it is located. A significant deterioration in that economy would negatively
impact the demand for the facility s services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for service as rendered. 

Our
net revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in Tennessee. Any change in the current demographic, economic,
competitive or regulatory conditions in the state could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Changes to the Medicaid program or other health care laws or regulations in Tennessee could also have an adverse effect. 

A
significant portion of our net revenues is dependent on Medicare and Medicaid payments and possible reductions in Medicare or Medicaid
payments or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements may reduce our revenues. 

A
significant portion of our net revenues is derived from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which are highly regulated and subject to
frequent and substantial changes. Previous legislative changes have resulted in, and future legislative changes may result in, limitations
on and reduced levels of payment and reimbursement for a substantial portion of hospital procedures and costs. 

Future
healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs may have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 

Failure
to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Billing
for medical services is extremely complicated and is subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending
on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians,
hospitals and employer groups. Changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process. Additionally,
auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost
and complexity to the billing process. 

Missing,
incomplete, or incorrect information adds complexity to and slows the billing process, creates backlogs of unbilled services, and generally
increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense. Failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed
for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash
flows. Failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing or even having to pay back amounts incorrectly billed and collected
could lead to various penalties, including: (1) exclusion from participation in CMS and other government programs; (2) asset forfeitures;
(3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate
our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows. 

There
have been times when our accounts receivable have increased at a greater rate than revenue growth and, therefore, have adversely affected
our cash flows from operations. We have taken steps to implement systems and processing changes intended to improve billing procedures
and related collection results. However, we cannot assure that our ongoing assessment of accounts receivable will not result in the need
for additional provisions. Such additional provisions, if implemented, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 

54 

Our
operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of extreme weather conditions, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes,
hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities. 

Our
operations are always subject to adverse impacts resulting from extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities or acts of
terrorism or other criminal activities. Such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek our services
or in our employees ability to perform their job duties. In addition, such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to provide
our services. The occurrence of any such event and/or a disruption of our operations as a result may adversely affect our results of
operations. 

Increased
competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability. 

We
operate in a business that is characterized by intense competition. Our major competitors include large national hospitals that possess
greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial resources and employ substantially more personnel
than we do. Many of our competitors have long established relationships. Although BSF operates in a community where it is currently the
only general acute care hospital, it faces substantial competition from other hospitals in the region. Although these competing hospitals
may be many miles away, patients in these markets may travel to these competing hospitals as a result of local physician referrals, managed
care plan incentives or personal choices. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with such entities in the
future. 

The
healthcare business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. Pricing of services is often one of the most significant
factors used by patients, health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a provider. As a result of the healthcare industry
undergoing significant consolidation, larger providers are able to increase cost efficiencies. This consolidation results in greater
price competition. We may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, our net earnings and cash
flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. We may also face competition from companies that do not comply with existing
laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. Additionally, we may also face changes in fee schedules,
competitive bidding for services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition.
Additional competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability. 

The
effects of the coronavirus pandemic have had, and a reoccurrence would have, a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations
and financial condition. 

Demand
for services at our hospitals was substantially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic . If the pandemic were to reoccur, we would expect
to incur lower net revenues and incur significant losses. Accordingly, additional capital would be required. 

The
coronavirus pandemic and the steps taken by governments to seek to reduce its spread had a severe impact on the economy and the health
care industry in particular. Hospitals were especially affected. Small rural hospitals, such as ours, may be overwhelmed by patients
if the pandemic were to reoccur in their local areas. Staffing costs, and concerns due to the potential exposure to infections, would
most likely increase, as well as the costs of needed medical supplies necessary to keep the hospitals open. Doctors and patients would
likely defer elective procedures and other health care services. Travel bans, social distancing and quarantines could limit access to
our facilities. Business closings and layoffs in our local areas would result in the loss of insurance and adversely affect demand for
our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services as rendered. 

Continued
supply chain shortages could increase our costs of operations or adversely affect our results of operations. 

Shortages,
delays, increased costs, and governmental restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic or arising out of increased demand as the pandemic
wanes have disrupted and may continue to disrupt the ability of our facilities to procure items used in their operations. A severe inability
to obtain such items or substantially increased costs for the items could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if we are
unable to pass such costs along to patients. 

55 

Sustained
inflation could increase our costs of operations. 

The
healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supply and other
costs. Furthermore, we are unable to predict whether recent inflationary spikes, which were initially thought to be transitory and due
to pandemic recovery related demand, labor shortages in selected markets, and supply chain issues, will continue for an extended period
of time. Substantially increased costs of personnel, goods, and services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if
we are unable to pass such costs along to patients. The concentration of our patients in persons for whom the cost of treatment is paid
for under government programs could substantially limit our ability to pass through such costs. 

Failure
to maintain the security of patient-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the Company s reputation
with patients and cause it to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation. 

Pursuant
to HIPAA and certain similar state laws, we must comply with comprehensive privacy and security standards with respect to the use and
disclosure of protected health information. Under the HITECH amendments to HIPAA, HIPAA was expanded to require certain data breach notifications,
to extend certain HIPAA privacy and security standards directly to business associates, to heighten penalties for noncompliance and to
enhance enforcement efforts. If the Company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations relating to protecting the privacy
and security of personal or health information, it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. 

The
Company receives certain personal and financial information about its patients. In addition, the Company depends upon the secure transmission
of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. While we take reasonable and prudent
steps to protect this information, a compromise in the Company s security systems that results in patient personal information
being obtained by unauthorized persons or the Company s failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions
could adversely affect the Company s reputation with its customers and others, as well as the Company s results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity. It could also result in litigation against the Company or the imposition of penalties. 

Failure
of the Company to comply with emerging electronic transmission standards could adversely affect our business. 

The
failure of our IT systems to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our revenues or increase our expenses. Public
and private initiatives to create healthcare information technology HCIT standards and to mandate standardized clinical
coding systems for the electronic exchange of clinical information could require costly modifications to our existing HCIT systems. While
we do not expect HCIT standards to be adopted or implemented without adequate time to comply, if we fail to adopt or delay in implementing
HCIT standards, we could lose customers and business opportunities. 

Compliance
with the HIPAA security regulations and privacy regulations may increase the Company s costs. 

The
HIPAA privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under HITECH, establish comprehensive federal standards with
respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses,
in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of protected health information. The regulations
establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: 

the
 circumstances under which the use and disclosure of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization
 by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the Company s services,
 and its healthcare operations activities; 

a
 patient s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information; 

the
 content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; 

administrative,
 technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and 

the
 protection of computing systems maintaining Electronic Personal Health Information ePHI ). 

56 

The
Company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, as required by
law. The privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore,
the Company is required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. In
addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the Company may also be required
to comply with the laws of those other countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict the Company s ability to use or disclose
patient identifiable data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined
by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations.
HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information
in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. Due to the enactment
of HITECH and an increase in the amount of monetary financial penalties, government enforcement has also increased. It is not possible
to predict what the extent of the impact on business will be, other than heightened scrutiny and emphasis on compliance. If the Company
does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information it could
be subject to significant monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. In addition, other federal and state laws that protect
the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities
and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. For example, the Company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action
brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. 

Failure
in the Company s information technology systems or delays or failures in the development and implementation of updates or enhancements
to those systems could significantly delay billing and otherwise disrupt the Company s operations or patient relationships. 

The
Company s business and patient relationships depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems.
Despite network security measures and other precautions, the Company s information technology systems are potentially vulnerable
to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. Sustained system failures or interruption of the Company s
systems in one or more of its operations could disrupt the Company s ability to conduct its business. Breaches with respect to
protected health information could result in violations of HIPAA and analogous state laws, and risk the imposition of significant fines
and penalties. Failure of the Company s information technology systems could adversely affect the Company s business, profitability
and financial condition. 

Health
care reform and related programs (e.g. Health Insurance Exchanges), changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes
in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms and evolving delivery models, could have a material adverse
impact on the Company s net revenues, profitability and cash flow. 

Our
services are billed to private patients, Medicare, Medicaid, commercial clients, managed care organizations MCOs and
third-party insurance companies. Bills may be sent to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient.
Increases in the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an adverse impact on the Company s
net revenues. 

A
portion of the third-party insurance fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and
coinsurance. As patient cost-sharing increases, collectability may be impacted. 

In
addition, Medicare and Medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health
care services. Measures to regulate health care delivery have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased utilization as well
as increased complexity and new regulatory and administrative requirements. Changes to, or repeal of, the ACA, the health care reform
legislation passed in 2010, also may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement and utilization of services, as well as administrative
requirements, in ways that are currently unpredictable. 

The
Company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursement, more stringent payment policies and utilization and cost controls by government
and other payers to continue. If the Company cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing
costs, increasing the number of patients treated and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company s
net revenues, profitability and cash flows. 

As
an employer, health care reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the Company to implement significant
process and record keeping changes to be in compliance. These changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees
and their families. Given the limited release of regulations to guide compliance, as well as potential changes to or repeal of the ACA,
the exact impact to employers including the Company is uncertain. 

Adverse
results in material litigation matters or governmental inquiries could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s business
and financial condition. 

The
Company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, professional liability,
contracts and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries and requests for information from governmental agencies and bodies and Medicare
or Medicaid payors requesting comment and/or information on allegations of billing irregularities, billing and pricing arrangements,
privacy practices and other matters that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. The healthcare industry
is subject to substantial Federal and state government regulation and audit. Legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages
as well as damage to the Company s reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business.
