 of the common shares of Worthington Steel to holders of record of Former Parent common shares as of the close of business on November 21, 2023, (the Record Date ). Each holder of record of Former Parent common shares received one common share of Worthington Steel for every one Former Parent common share held at the close of business on the Record Date (the Distribution ). In connection with the Separation, Worthington Steel made a cash distribution to the Former Parent of million from the issuances of certain debt (see Note 7 Debt). Additionally, as part of the Separation, the Former Parent made a contribution of certain assets and liabilities, including million of cash and cash equivalents, to Worthington Steel. The Former Parent retained no ownership interest in Worthington Steel following the Separation. Agreements with the Former Parent and Separation Costs On November 30, 2023, in connection with the Separation, the Company entered into several agreements with the Former Parent that govern the relationship between the Former Parent and the Company following the Distribution, including a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Steel Supply Agreement, and Transition Services Agreement. Direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with the Separation, including (a) fees paid to third parties for audit, advisory, and legal services to effect the Separation, (b) non-recurring employee-related costs, such as retention bonuses, and (c) non-recurring functional costs associated with shared corporate functions (collectively, the Separation costs are presented separately in the Company s consolidated and combined statements of earnings. Separation costs totaled million during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 . Separation costs were incurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Basis of Presentation Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements The Company s financial statements for the periods until the Separation on December 1, 2023, are combined financial statements prepared on a carve-out basis as discussed below. The Company s financial statements for the periods beginning on and after December 1, 2023, are consolidated financial statements based on the reported results of Worthington Steel as a stand-alone company. Accordingly, the third quarter of fiscal 2024, and thereafter, included consolidated and combined financial statements, whereas all prior periods included combined financial statements. The accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). The consolidated and combined financial statements may not be indicative of the Company s future performance and do not necessarily reflect what the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows would have been had it operated as an independent company during all of the periods presented. Basis of Presentation Prior to Separation Prior to the Separation on December 1, 2023, the Company operated as a business of the Former Parent. Accordingly, the combined historical financial statements for the periods presented prior to and as of November 30, 2023, are prepared on a carve-out basis. The Company s combined financial statements are prepared on a carve-out basis using the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of the Former Parent in accordance with GAAP. The Company s combined financial statements include the historical operations that comprise its business and reflect significant assumptions and allocations as well as certain assets and liabilities that have historically been held at the Former Parent s corporate level but are specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to the Company.

operating joint ventures: Spartan Steel Coating, L.L.C. Spartan ( ); TWB Company, L.L.C. TWB ( ); and Worthington Samuel Coil Processing, L.L.C. WSCP ( ). The Company also owns a controlling interest in Worthington Specialty Processing WSP ), which became a non-operating joint venture on October 31, 2022, when its remaining net assets were sold. These joint ventures are consolidated with the equity owned by the other joint venture members shown as noncontrolling interests in the Company s consolidated balance sheets, and their portions of net earnings and other comprehensive income (loss) OCI shown as net earnings or comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Company s consolidated and combined statements of earnings and comprehensive income, respectively. The Company owns a noncontrolling interest in unconsolidated joint venture: Serviacero Planos, S. de R.L. de C.V. Serviacero Worthington ). The Company s investment in the unconsolidated affiliate is accounted for using the equity method with the Company s proportionate share of income or loss recognized within equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliate equity income in its consolidated and combined statements of earnings. See further discussion of the Company s unconsolidated affiliate in Note 3 Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate. Organizational Structure and Operating Segment The Company s operations are managed principally on a products and services basis under a single group organizational structure. Following the Separation, the financial information reviewed by the Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM for the purpose of assessing performance and allocating resources has been presented as a single component, or operating segment, and comprises all of the Company s operations. The Company s CODM is Worthington Steel s Chief Executive Officer CEO ). Concentration of Net Sales The Company sells its products and services to a diverse customer base and a broad range of end markets. The automotive industry is the largest end market for the Company with sales representing of its consolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and of its combined net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Sales to one automotive customer represented of consolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and of combined the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Preparation of Financial Statements Including the Use of Estimates These unaudited consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature except those which have been disclosed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated and combined financial statements for these interim periods, have been included. Operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entirety of fiscal 2025 or any other quarter. Refer to the consolidated and combined financial statements and notes thereto included in the 2024 Form 10-K for further information on the preparation of financial statements including the use of estimates. The preparation of consolidated and combined financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

million and million of outstanding borrowings drawn against the Credit Facility, respectively, leaving a borrowing capacity of million and million , respe ctively, subject to the eligible borrowing base, available for use. Individual amounts drawn under the Credit Facility accrue interest at rates equal to an applicable margin over the one-, three-, or six-month term SOFR Rate, plus a SOFR adjustment. The Company incurred approximately million of issuance costs, of which million will be amortized to interest expense over the expected five-year Credit Facility term and are reflected in other assets. The Credit Facility permits borrowings under two types of borrowing mechanisms: (i) Term SOFR Rate Loans and (ii) a swing loan. The Term SOFR Rate Loans permit the Company to draw a specific principal amount for a defined maturity of up to with the interest rate determined at the time of the draw, which equals an applicable margin over the applicable term SOFR Rate, plus a SOFR adjustment. Each Term SOFR Rate Loan has an individual, unique identifier and is distinguishable from the other Term SOFR Rate Loans drawn by the Company. At the end of each relevant interest period, the Company has the option to continue the same interest period for such Term SOFR Rate Loan or the Company can request a conversion to a new interest period for such Term SOFR Rate Loan. If no notice is given by the Company, the Term SOFR Rate Loan is deemed to continue with the same interest period. The swing loan permits the Company to draw on the Credit Facility at any time up to a maximum of the greater of (i) million or (ii) of the then-maximum amount of the Credit Facility. The swing loan interest rate is variable based upon the interest rate market. As of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the swing loan rate was equal to . Any amounts drawn on the swing loan mature on the same date as the maturity of the Credit Facility; however, it has been the practice of the Company to repay the outstanding draws on the swing loan within a short-term period. The Credit Facility is secured by a first priority lien (subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions) on certain working capital assets of the Company and the guarantors, including accounts and inventory, but excluding intellectual property, real property and equity interests, and subject to customary exceptions. The Company currently has no material contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends provided that no event of default exists under the Credit Facility and it meets the minimum availability threshold thereunder. As of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding interest-bearing debt under the Credit Facility was and , respectively. Term Loan Facility with the Former Parent On June 8, 2021, TWB entered into a million term loan agreement (the TWB Term Loan with a subsidiary of the Former Parent that matured in annual installments through . The proceeds were used by TWB to finance the Shiloh U.S BlankLight purchase price. This note accrued interest at a rate of per annum. The borrowings were the legal obligation of TWB and required settlement, in cash, in accordance with the TWB Term Loan. As such, the debt and related interest was attributed to the Company in the consolidated and combined financial statements prior to the Separation. The Former Parent s note receivable associated with the TWB Term Loan was contributed to the Company in connection with the Separation on December 1, 2023. As a result, the TWB Term Loan balance was eliminated in consolidation following the Separation, which resulted in a balance as of May 31, 2024 in the consolidated balance sheet.

 The consolidated and combined statement of earnings classification of amounts reclassified to net income include: (1) 

and for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and the first quarter of fiscal 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 differed from the statutory rate primarily due to recognizing a discrete tax item for a pre-acquisition tax matter at Tempel. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 differed from the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible executive compensation, foreign derived intangible income, and the effects of foreign tax rate differences. The provision for income taxes is based on a current estimate of the annual effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the impact of discrete items and excludes any impact from the inclusion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated and combined statements of earnings. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are a result of the Company s consolidated joint ventures. The net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests in the U.S. operations of the Company s consolidated joint ventures do not generate tax expense to the Company since the investors are taxed directly based on the earnings attributable to the investors. The tax expense of TWB s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is reported in the consolidated and combined income tax expense. Management is required to estimate the annual effective income tax rate based upon its forecast of annual pre-tax income for domestic and foreign operations. The Company s actual effective income tax rate for fiscal 2025 could be materially different from the forecasted rate as of August 31, 2024 .

 , the Company acquired , including its lamination stamping facility in Nagold, Germany and related assets, for net cash consideration of million and the assumption of a million pension liability. Voestalpine Nagold produces automotive and electrical steel lamination stampings in Europe. The total purchase consideration was preliminarily allocated primarily to tangible assets, consisting of million of property, plant and equipment and million of net working capital, with million recognized as goodwill. The information included in the preliminary allocation of the purchase price was derived using estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired. As a result of final purchase accounting adjustments, the total purchase consideration was updated. The purchase consideration consisted of million of property, plant and equipment and million of net working capital, with million recognized as goodwill. Thus, the final purchase accounting adjustments consisted of million of property, plant and equipment and million of net working capital, with million to goodwill. There was change in the valuation of the pension liability. The purchase price includes the fair values of other assets that were not identifiable, not separately recognizable under accounting rules (e.g., assembled workforce) or of immaterial value. The purchase price also includes strategic benefits specific to the Company, which resulted in a purchase price in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition will be deductible for income tax purposes. The results of operations of Voestalpine Nagold have been included in the consolidated and combined statements of earnings since the date of acquisition. Proforma results, including the acquired business since the beginning of fiscal 2023, would not be materially different from the reported results.

GAAP permits an entity to present derivative financial instruments assets and liabilities on a net basis on the balance sheet, provided a right of offset exists and/or when they are subject to a master netting arrangement. The Company s policy is to record derivative financial instruments on a net basis where the Company has an executed master netting arrangement with counterparties as well as where the right of offset exists. The amounts in the table above reflect the fair value of the derivative financial instruments on a net basis where allowable under master netting arrangement s. Had these amounts been recognized on a gross basis, the impact would have been a million increase in receivables with a corresponding increase in accounts payable.

Had these amounts been recognized on a gross basis, the impact would have been a million increase in receivables with a corresponding increase in accounts payable. Cash Flow Hedges The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to commodity price and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain forecasted transactions. These derivative financial instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of the gain or loss on each of these derivative financial instruments is reported as a component of OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same line associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognized in earnings immediately.

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements At August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 , there were material assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, income taxes receivable, other assets, accounts payable, accrued compensation, contributions to employee benefit plans and related taxes, other accrued items, income taxes payable and other liabilities, approximate carrying value due to their short-term nature. The remaining carrying value of debt was million and million at August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 , respectively, and relates to the Credit Facility, which due to its short-term nature, approximates fair value.

million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. Following the Separation, the Company independently incurs expenses as a stand-alone company and corporate expenses from the Former Parent are no longer allocated to the Company; therefore, no related amounts were reflected on the Company's consolidated and combined financial statements for the three months ended August 31, 2024. Attribution of Separation Costs Separation costs that were incurred by the Former Parent that were directly attributed to the Company to the extent incurred to its direct benefit are presented separately in the consolidated and combined statements of earnings. Following the Separation, the Company incurred incremental costs related to the Separation, which are reflected on the Company's consolidated and combined statements of earnings. See Note 1 Description of Business, The Separation, Agreements with the Former Parent and Separation Costs, and Basis of Presentation for additional information. Net Sales to the Former Parent Prior to the Separation, the Company s net sales to the Former Parent were considered sales on a carve-out basis, and were included within the net sales within the combined statements of earnings. Net sales to the Former Parent totaled million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. Following the Separation, the majority of the Company s net sales to the Former Parent are subject to the long-term Steel Supply Agreement and are included within the net sales within the consolidated statement of earnings. Net sales to the Former Parent totaled million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. Due to/from the Former Parent Cash was managed centrally prior to the Separation, so long-term intercompany financing arrangements were used to fund expansion or certain working capital needs. Excluding the TWB Term Loan discussed in Note 7 Debt , debt resulting from these long-term intercompany financing arrangements has been reflected in Net Investment by the Former Parent within equity as applicable in fiscal 2024. The Former Parent s note receivable associated with the TWB Term Loan, which matured in annual installments through , was contributed to the Company in connection with the Separation on December 1, 2023. As a result, the TWB Term Loan balance was eliminated in consolidation following the Separation. The corresponding interest expense, which accrued at a rate of per annum, was million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. Refer to Note 7 Debt for additional information. As of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the outstanding accounts receivable balance with the Former Parent equaled million and million , respectively, as a result of the net sales to the Former Parent described above. Net Investment by the Former Parent Prior to the Separation, related party transactions between the Former Parent and the Company have been included within Net Investment by the Former Parent in the combined balance sheet in the periods presented as these related party transactions were part of the centralized cash management program and were not settled in cash. Net Investment by the Former Parent in the combined balance sheet and combined statements of equity represents the Former Parent s historical investment in the Company, the net effect of transactions with and allocations from the Former Parent, and the Company s retained earnings. million distribution, are in cluded within Net Investment by the Former Parent. Additionally, as part of the Separation in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Former Parent made a contribution of certain assets and liabilities, including million of cash and cash equivalents, to Worthington Steel. There were no subsequent transactions within Net Investment by the Former Parent.

 Worthington Steel was formed as an Ohio corporation on February 28, 2023, for the purpose of receiving, pursuant to a reorganization, all of the outstanding equity interests of the steel processing business of the Former Parent. On December 1, 2023, the Separation was completed and Worthington Steel became an independent, publicly traded company. Our financial statements for the periods until the Separation on December 1, 2023, are combined financial statements prepared on a carve-out basis. Our financial statements for the periods beginning on and after December 1, 2023, are consolidated financial statements based on our reported results as a stand-alone company. Accordingly, the third quarter of fiscal 2024, and thereafter, included consolidated and combined financial statements, whereas all prior periods included combined financial statements. For additional information, see Note 1 Description of Business, The Separation, Agreements with the Former Parent and Separation Costs, and Basis of Presentation. 
 
 Business Overview 
 
 We are one of North America s premier value-added metals processors with the ability to provide a diversified range of products and services that span a variety of end markets. We maintain market leading positions in the North American carbon flat-rolled steel and tailor welded blank industries and are one of the largest global producers of electrical steel laminations. For nearly 70 years, we have been delivering high quality steel processing capabilities across a variety of end-markets including automotive, heavy truck, agriculture, construction, and energy. With the ability to produce customized steel solutions, we aim to be the preferred value-added steel processor in the markets we serve by delivering highly technical, customer specified solutions, while also providing advanced materials support. Our scale and operating footprint allow us to achieve an advantaged cost structure and service platform supported by a strategic operating footprint. We serve our customers primarily by processing flat-rolled steel coils, which we source primarily from various North American steel mills, into the precise type, thickness, length, width, shape, and surface quality required by customer specifications. We sell steel on a direct basis, whereby we are exposed to the risk and rewards of ownership of the material while in our possession. Additionally, we toll process steel under a fee for service arrangement whereby we process customer-owned material. Our manufacturing facilities further benefit from the flexibility to scale between direct and tolling services based on demand dynamics throughout the year. 
 
 Our operations are managed principally on a products and services basis under a single group organizational structure. We own controlling interests in the following operating joint ventures: Spartan, TWB, and WSCP. We also own a controlling interest in WSP,

which became a non-operating joint venture in October 2022, when we completed the divestiture of its remaining net assets. The net assets and operating results of these joint ventures are consolidated with the equity owned by the minority joint venture member shown as Noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets, and the noncontrolling interest in net earnings and OCI shown as net earnings or comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated and combined statements of earnings and consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive income (loss), respectively. Our remaining joint venture, Serviacero Worthington, is unconsolidated and accounted for using the equity method. 
 Recent Business Development 
 On September 25, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.16 per common share payable on December 27, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 13, 2024. 

Trends and Factors Impacting our Performance 
 
 The steel processing industry is fragmented and highly competitive. Given the broad base of products and services offered, specific competitors vary based on the target industry, product type, service type, size of program and geography. Competition is primarily on the basis of price, product quality and the ability to meet delivery requirements. Our processed steel products are priced competitively, primarily based on market factors, including, among other things, market pricing, the cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and shipping costs, and overall economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. 
 
 General Economic and Market Conditions 
 We sell our products and services to a diverse customer base and a broad range of end markets. The breakdown of net sales by end market for the three months ended August 31, 2024, and August 31, 2023 is illustrated below:

The automotive industry is one of the largest consumers of flat-rolled steel in North America, and thus the largest end market for us and our unconsolidated joint venture, Serviacero Worthington. North American vehicle production, including Ford, General Motors and Stellantis North America (the Detroit Three Automakers ), is a leading indicator of automotive demand. North American vehicle production, as well as the Detroit Three Automakers vehicle production, was down in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. 
 
 Our remaining net sales are to other markets such as agricultural, appliance, construction, container, energy, heavy truck, HVAC, industrial electric motor, generator, and transformer. Given the many different products that make up our net sales and the wide variety of end markets we serve, it is very difficult to isolate the key market indicators that drive this portion of our business. However, we believe that the trend in U.S. gross domestic product growth U.S. GDP is a reasonable macroeconomic indicator for analyzing the demand of our end markets other than the automotive industry. U.S. GDP has shown moderate growth in the face of sustained, elevated interest rates. 
 
 The previously seen inflationary pressures largely subsided during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to the levels experienced over the past fiscal years. Nonetheless, the elevated interest rates over the first quarter of fiscal 2025 contributed to high borrowing costs. The U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark interest rate subsequent to the ending of the first quarter of fiscal 2025 in response to fading inflation. Thus, the impacts of such a decision were not reflected in our first quarter of 2025 results, as we had not yet benefited from the recent lowering of the benchmark interest rate.

Sales to one automotive customer represented 13.3 and 16.5 of our consolidated and combined net sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. Sales to the Detroit Three automakers represented 32.1 and 33.9 of our consolidated and combined net sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. While our automotive business is largely driven by the production schedules of the Detroit Three automakers, our customer base is much broader and includes other domestic manufacturers and many of their suppliers. 
 
 Sales for most of our products are generally strongest in our fiscal fourth quarter when our facilities operate at seasonal peaks. Historically, sales have been weaker in our fiscal third quarter, primarily due to reduced seasonal activity in the building and construction industry, as well as customer plant shutdowns due to holidays, particularly in the automotive industry. We do not believe backlog is a significant indicator of our business. 
 
 Impact of Raw Material Prices 
 
 Our principal raw material is flat-rolled steel, including electrical steel, which we purchase in coils from primary steel producers. The steel industry as a whole has been cyclical, and at times availability and pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control. This volatility can significantly affect our steel costs. In an environment of increasing prices for steel and other raw materials, competitive conditions may impact how much of the price increases we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are able to pass on to our customers future price increases in raw materials, this could positively affect our financial results resulting in inventory holding gains. To the extent we are unable to pass on to our customers future price increases in raw materials, our financial results could be adversely affected. Also, if steel prices decrease, in general, competitive conditions may impact how quickly we must reduce our prices to our customers, and we could be forced to use higher-priced raw materials already in our inventory to complete orders for which the selling prices have decreased, which results in inventory holding losses. Declining steel prices could also require us to write-down the value of our inventories to reflect current market pricing. Further, the number of suppliers has decreased in recent years due to industry consolidation and the financial difficulties of certain suppliers, and consolidation may continue. Accordingly, if delivery from a major steel supplier is disrupted, it may be more difficult to obtain an alternative supply than in the past or the alternative supply may only be available at a premium. 
 
 The market price of our products is closely related to the price of HRC. The price of benchmark HRC is primarily affected by the demand for steel and the cost of raw materials. Steel prices declined in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2024 before increasing in the third quarter and again declining in the fourth quarter. Over fiscal 2024, the decreases in prices in the first, second and fourth quarters more than offset the increase in prices in the third quarter, which resulted in the fiscal 2024 average price being lower as compared to fiscal 2023. Steel pricing continued to decline during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, resulting in estimated inventory holding losses of 16.6 million. With the recent price declines, we expect inventory holding losses will continue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, but at a lesser extent compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 
 To manage our exposure to market risk, we attempt to negotiate the best prices for steel and to competitively price products and services to reflect the fluctuations in market prices. Derivative financial instruments have been used to manage a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in the cost of steel. These contracts covered periods commensurate with known or expected exposures throughout the periods presented. The derivative financial instruments were executed with highly rated financial institutions.

No matter how efficient, our operations, which use steel as a raw material, create some amount of scrap. The expected price of scrap compared to the price of the steel raw material is factored into pricing. Generally, as the price of steel increases, the price of scrap increases by a similar amount. When increases in scrap prices do not keep pace with the increases in the price of the steel raw material, it can have a negative impact on our margins.

(1) On December 1, 2023, there were approximately 49.3 million common shares outstanding following the Distribution. The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for all periods through November 30, 2023, was calculated (a) using this same number of common shares outstanding since no Worthington Steel equity awards were outstanding as of the Separation Date and (b) net of Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest as such interest is fully associated with continuing operations. 

Net sales totaled 834.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, down 71.8 million, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a 6 decrease in direct selling prices and a 4 decrease in direct tons sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by more favorable mix within toll tons sold. The mix of direct versus toll volumes was 56 to 44 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and the prior year quarter.

Gross margin decreased 28.1 million over the prior year quarter to 100.4 million, primarily due to unfavorable direct spreads (sales less material costs) and lower direct volume. Direct spreads, excluding the Voestalpine Nagold acquisition, down 23.8 million, were impacted by a 32.1 million unfavorable change from an estimated 15.5 million inventory holding gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to estimated 16.6 million inventory holding loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The impact of lower direct volumes was largely offset by improved mix within toll processing in the current year quarter compared with the prior year quarter.

 Separation costs decreased by 3.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as the Separation was finalized on December 1, 2023, which was the first day of the third quarter of fiscal 2024. No additional Separation costs are expected subsequent to fiscal 2024, and no additional Separation costs were recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

This was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the prior year quarter due to the outstanding short-term borrowings under the AR Facility, which was terminated in June 2023, as well as the TWB Term Loan, which was subsequently contributed to the Company in connection with the Separation on December 1, 2023.

Income tax expense was 4.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 17.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily driven by lower pre-tax earnings and the recognition of a discrete 4.4 million net tax benefit related to pre-acquisition tax matters at Tempel. The income tax expense in the current quarter resulted in an effective tax rate of 12.3 , compared to 22.6 for the prior year quarter. For additional information regarding our income taxes, refer to Note 10 Income Taxes. 
 
 Adjusted EBIT 
 
 We evaluate operating performance on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest and taxes adjusted EBIT ). EBIT, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by adding interest expense and income tax expense to net earnings attributable to controlling interest. Adjusted EBIT, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes impairment and restructuring expense (income), but may also exclude other items, as described below, that management believes are not reflective of, and thus should not be included when evaluating the performance of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBIT is used by management to evaluate operating performance and engage in financial and operational planning, because we believe that this financial measure provides additional perspective on the performance of our ongoing operations. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they allow for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our businesses and enable investors to evaluate operations and future prospects in the same manner as management. 
 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to controlling interest (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) to adjusted EBIT for the periods presented:

(1) Impairment charges are excluded because they do not occur in the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations, are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount, and are non-cash, so their exclusion facilitates the comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results. Non-cash impairment charge in the prior year period was driven by changes in the estimated fair market value less cost to sell related to ongoing efforts to divest certain production equipment at WSCP s former toll processing facility in Cleveland, Ohio, and excludes the noncontrolling interest portion of impairment of long-lived assets of 0.5 million in

the prior year quarter. A more detailed discussion of our impairment activity can be found elsewhere in this MD A as well as in Note 4 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. 

(2) Separation costs reflect the direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with the Separation. These costs have been directly attributed to us to the extent incurred to our direct benefit, and include third-party advisory fees, certain employee-related costs and non-recurring costs associated with the separation of shared corporate functions. 

(3) Income tax benefit and indemnification payable adjustments reported in Miscellaneous income (expense), net and income tax expense related to an indemnification agreement with the former owners of Tempel as a result of a current quarter favorable tax ruling in one of the jurisdictions in which Tempel operates. The indemnification agreement, which was entered into with the former Tempel owners at the time we acquired Tempel, provides protection to us from rulings by tax authorities regarding events that occurred through the acquisition date. 

Adjusted EBIT in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was down 41.1 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to a 28.1 million decrease in gross margin which was impacted by a 32.1 million unfavorable change from an estimated 15.5 million inventory holding gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to estimated 16.6 million inventory holding loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Additionally, adjusted EBIT was negatively impacted by lower equity earnings at Serviacero Worthington, which decreased 7.7 million, and a 3.2 million increase in SG A expense, primarily associated with incremental labor and other incremental public company stand-alone costs. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Historically, we financed our working capital requirements through cash flows from operating activities and arrangements with the Former Parent. Upon completion of the Separation, we ceased such arrangements with the Former Parent and secured independent debt financing in the form of the Credit Facility. Our capital structure, long-term commitments, and liquidity sources have thus changed from our prior practices. Our ability to fund our operating needs is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations, and on our ability to maintain our debt financing on acceptable terms. 
 
 Our primary ongoing requirements for cash are expected to be for working capital, funding of acquisitions, dividend payments, debt redemptions and capital expenditures. We believe that our sources of liquidity, including our cash balances, the funds generated by our operating activities and the funds accessible to us through the Credit Facility, are adequate to fund our operations for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future and will allow us to meet our current and long-term obligations and strategic initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that our current sources of liquidity and capital resources will continue to be sufficient for our needs or that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms in the future. A more detailed description regarding our capital structure changes can be found elsewhere in this MD A as well as in the Financing Activities section below. 
 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we generated 54.6 million of cash from operating activities and invested 21.5 million in property, plant and equipment. Additionally, we made net debt repayments of 25.8 million under the Credit Facility, and we paid dividends of 8.0 million. The following table summarizes our consolidated and combined cash flows for the periods presented.

We believe we have access to adequate resources to meet the needs of our existing businesses for normal operating costs, mandatory capital expenditures, debt redemptions, dividend payments, and working capital, to the extent not funded by cash provided by operating activities, for at least 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. These resources include cash and cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity available on the Credit Facility. 
 Although we do not currently anticipate a need, we believe that we could access the financial markets to be in a position to sell long-term debt or equity securities. However, the continuation of uncertain economic conditions and a heightened interest rate environment could create volatility in the financial markets, which may impact our ability to access capital and the terms under which we can do so. We will continue to monitor the economic environment and its impact on our operations and liquidity needs. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

We routinely monitor current operational requirements, financial market conditions, and credit relationships and we may choose to seek additional capital by issuing new debt and/or equity securities to strengthen our liquidity or capital structure. While we believe we currently have adequate capital, should we seek additional capital, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such additional capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and such additional equity or debt financing could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders and/or increase our interest costs. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Our business is cyclical and cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate during the year and from year to year due to economic and industry conditions. We rely on cash and short-term borrowings to meet cyclical increases in working capital needs. These needs generally rise during periods of increased economic activity or increasing raw material prices, requiring higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable. During economic slowdowns, or periods of decreasing raw material costs, working capital needs generally decrease as a result of the reduction of inventories and accounts receivable. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 54.6 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 20.7 million net cash used in operating activities during the three months ended August 31, 2023. This change was primarily due to an 88.7 million increase in cash from net operating working capital (accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable), driven by the reduction in average steel prices over the prior year period. This was offset by a 29.9 million decrease in net earnings. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 21.5 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 17.3 million during the three months ended August 31, 2023. The driver of net cash used in investing activities in both the current year and prior year periods was capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures in the current year quarter compared with the prior year quarter was substantially related to the previously announced strategic expansions of our electrical steel operations in Mexico and Canada to service the automotive and transformer markets, respectively. 
 
 Investment activities are largely discretionary and future investment activities could be reduced significantly, or eliminated, as economic conditions warrant. We assess acquisition opportunities as they arise, and any such opportunities may require additional financing. However, there can be no assurance that any such opportunities will arise, that any such acquisition opportunities will be consummated, or that any needed additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms. We estimate our annual maintenance capital needs to be between approximately 35.0 million and 40.0 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 37.3 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 32.7 million during the three months ended August 31, 2023. In the prior year quarter in connection with the centralized cash management program utilized prior to the Separation, we received cash from the Former Parent to fund working capital requirements. The current year quarter included net short-term repayments of 25.8 million under our Credit Facility (see the Revolving credit facility section below) and 8.0 million of dividends paid to shareholders of our common shares. 
 
 Revolving credit facility We entered into the Credit Facility on November 30, 2023, immediately prior to the Separation. The Credit Facility allows for borrowings of up to 550.0 million, to the extent secured by eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances at period end, which consist primarily of U.S. dollar denominated account balances. Individual amounts drawn under the Credit Facility will have interest periods of up to six months and will accrue interest at rates equal to an applicable margin over the applicable Term SOFR Rate, plus a SOFR adjustment. We incurred approximately 2.7 million of issuance costs, of which 2.5 million will be amortized to interest expense over the five-year Credit Facility term and are reflected in other assets 
 
 As of August 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility does not include credit rating triggers. There were 122.2 million outstanding borrowings drawn against the Credit Facility at August 31, 2024, leaving a borrowing capacity of 427.8 million, subject to the eligible borrowing base, available for use. Under the Credit Facility, we may extend borrowings up to the maturity date subject to the eligible borrowing base. 
 
 Common shares Prior to the Separation, our common shares were owned by the Former Parent. After the Separation was completed as described in Note 9 Equity , there were 49.3 million shares issued and outstanding. On December 1, 2023, the common shares began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol WS. 
 
 On September 25, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of 0.16 per common share payable on December 27, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 13, 2024.

 Dividend Policy 
 
 We currently have no material contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends provided that no event of default exists under the Credit Facility and it meets the minimum availability threshold thereunder. Dividends are declared at the discretion of the Board. The Board reviews the dividend quarterly and establishes the dividend rate based upon our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, current and projected cash flows, business prospects, and other relevant factors. There is no guarantee that we will continue the payments of dividends in the future or that any dividends declared by the Board in the future will be similar in amount or timing to any dividends previously declared by the Board. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated and combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect our significant judgments and uncertainties that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Although actual results historically have not deviated significantly from those determined using our estimates, our financial position or results of operations could be materially different if we were to report under different conditions or to use different assumptions in the application of such estimates. Our critical accounting estimates have not significantly changed from those discussed in Part II Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates of the 2024 Form 10-K.
