 Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility Senior Notes due October 26, 2030, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 1.2 million and 1.5 million, respectively 
 Total debt 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 On May 6, 2022, the company entered into a senior credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement), providing the company with a multi-currency credit facility with an initial borrowing capacity of up to billion, including a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement also provided for the issuance of letters of credit and a swingline facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement was amended twice in September 2022 and again most recently in June 2024 (Amended 2022 Credit Agreement) to, among other items, eliminate the options for a second term loan draw and increase both the term loan and revolving credit facility to million each, raising the total borrowing capacity to billion (Amended 2022 Term Facility and Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, respectively), and to update the reference rate for credit extensions in Canadian dollars. Aside from the increased borrowing capacity, the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement left the 2022 Credit Agreement terms largely unchanged. As of September 30, 2024, our total outstanding debt under the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement was million, net of debt issuance costs, with borrowing availability of million under the Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 The interest rate applicable to any loan under the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement is, at the company's option, either: (i) the applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus an applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between and , based on the company's consolidated leverage ratio or (ii) the lender's base rate plus the applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between and , based on the company's consolidated leverage ratio. 
 
 The portions of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are included in other current and non-current assets, and the portion of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Term Facility is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the Amended 2022 Term Facility. Debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the term of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement. Debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Term Facility are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement. 
 
 Private Placement Debt Offering 
 
 On October 26, 2020, we completed the issuance and sale of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due October 26, 2030 (the 2030 Notes), in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds were primarily used to repay a portion of the company's outstanding debt under the company's prior credit facility. Interest on the 2030 Notes is paid semi-annually on each October 30 and A pril 30 during the term of the 2030 Notes and at maturity, with the first interest payment date having occurred on April 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, our total outstanding debt, net of issuance costs, under the 2030 Notes was million.

 operating segments, w hich are presented as the following reportable segments: Morningstar Data and Analytics, PitchBook, Morningstar Wealth, Morningstar Credit, and Morningstar Retirement. The company's operating segments also represent the company's reporting units to which goodwill is assigned. The company allocate d goodwill by reporting unit in accordance with FASB ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other (FASB ASC 350). Under this reporting unit structure, the consolidated goodwill balance was allocated based on each reporting unit's relative fair value at January 1, 2021. The company used a market approach and assigned goodwill to the reporting units. The following table shows the changes in our goodwill balances from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024: 
 
 Divestiture of Commodity and Energy Data business (See Note 5) ) ) ) Foreign currency translation Balance as of September 30, 2024 
 
 Changes in the carrying amount of the company s recorded goodwill are mainly the result of business acquisitions, divestitures, and the effect of foreign currency translations. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, the company does not amortize goodwill; instead, goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we assess a number of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include macroeconomic conditions affecting our reporting units, financial performance of our reporting units, market and competitive factors related to our reporting units, and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test. The quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using a market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, as well as revenue and earnings multiples of publicly traded companies whose services and markets are comparable. 
 
 We perform our annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter or when impairment indicators and triggering events are identified. The company did not record any goodwill impairment in the first nine months of 2 024. R efer to Note 8 for detailed segment information.

 Asset-based Transaction-based Consolidated revenue 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) Starting with the quarter ended March 31, 2024, revenue from PitchBook media sales product was reclassified from license-based to transaction-based. Prior periods have not been restated to reflect the updated classifications. 
 
 License-based performance obligations are generally satisfied over time as the customer has access to the product or service during the term of the subscription license and the level of service is consistent during the contract period. License-based agreements typically have a term of to years and are accounted for as subscription services available to customers and not as a license under the accounting guidance. 

15 

Table of Contents 

 to years. Asset-based fees represent variable consideration, and the customer does not make separate purchasing decisions that result in additional performance obligations. Significant changes in the underlying fund assets and significant disruptions in the market are evaluated to determine whether estimates of earned asset-based fees need to be revised for the current quarter. The timing of client asset reporting and the structure of certain contracts can result in a lag between market movements and the impact on earned revenue. An estimate of variable consideration is included in the initial transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the revenue recognized will not occur. Estimates of asset-based fees are based on the most recently completed quarter and, as a result, it is unlikely a significant reversal of revenue would occur. 
 
 Transaction-based performance obligations are satisfied when the product or service is completed or delivered. Some transaction-based revenue includes revenue from surveillance services, which is recognized over time, as the customer has access to the service during the surveillance period. 
 
 Contract Liabilities 
 
 Our contract liabilities represent deferred revenue. We record contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which may be refundable. The contract liabilities balance as of September 30, 2024 had a net increase of million, primarily driven by cash payments received or payable in advance of satisfying our performance obligations. We reco gn ized million of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was included in the contract liabilities balance as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total 
 
 The aggregate amount of revenue we expect to recognize for the remainder of 2024 and subsequent years is higher than our contract liability balance of million as of September 30, 2024. The difference represents the value of future obligations for signed contracts that have yet to be billed. 
 
 The table above does not include variable consideration for unsatisfied performance obligations related to certain of our license-based, asset-based, and transaction-based contracts as of September 30, 2024. We are applying the optional exemption available under ASC Topic 606, as the variable consideration relates to these unsatisfied performance obligations being fulfilled as a series. The performance obligations related to these contracts are expected to be satisfied over the next to years as services are provided to the client. For license-based contracts, the consideration received for services performed is based on the number of future users, which is not known until the services are performed. The variable consideration for this revenue can be affected by the number of user licenses, which cannot be reasonably estimated. For asset-based contracts, the consideration received for services performed is based on future asset values, which are not known until the services are performed. The variable consideration for this revenue can be affected by changes in th e underlying value of fund assets due to client redemptions, additional investments, or movements in the market. For transaction-based contracts, the consideration receive d for most Internet advertising servic es performed is based on the number of impressions, which is not known until the impressions are created. The variable consideration for this revenue can be affected by the timing and quantity of impressions in any given period and cannot be reasonably estimated.

 Our effective tax rate in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was and , respectively, reflecting decreases of and percentage points, respectively, compared with the same periods in the prior year. The decreases are primarily attributable to the book gain in excess of taxable gain on the sale of our Commodity and Energy Data business in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) agreed to a two-pillar approach to global taxation focusing on global profit allocation (Pillar One) and a global minimum tax rate (Pillar Two). In December 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the OECD s global corporate minimum tax rate of 15 under Pillar Two which became effective in January 2024. Other countries are also considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD s proposals. This legislation represents a significant change in the international tax regime and could result in increases to our effective tax rate as a result of the imposition of minimum taxes. Pillar Two did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024. We are continuing to monitor developments and administrative guidance in addition to evaluating the potential impact of Pillar Two on our consolidated financial statements for future periods.

 o f our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance as of September 30, 2024 was held by our operations outside of the United States. We generally consider our U.S. directly-owned foreign subsidiary earnings to be permanently reinvested. We believe that our cash balances and investments in the United States, along with cash generated from our U.S. operations, will be sufficient to meet our U.S. operating and cash needs for the foreseeable future, without requiring us to repatriate earnings from these foreign subsidiaries. 
 
 Certain of our non-U.S. operations have incurred net operating losses (NOLs), which may become deductible to the extent these operations become profitable. For each of our operations, we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the tax benefits related to NOLs will be realized. As part of this evaluation, we consider evidence such as tax planning strategies, historical operating results, forecasted taxable income, and recent financial performance. In the year that certain non-U.S. operations record a loss, we do not recognize a corresponding tax benefit, which increases our effective tax rate. Upon determining that it is more likely than not that the NOLs will be realized, we reduce the tax valuation allowances related to these NOLs, which results in a reduction to our income tax expense and our effective tax rate in that period.

Understanding our company 
 
 Our Business 
 
 Our mission is to empower investor success. The investing ecosystem is complex, and navigating it with confidence requires a trusted, independent voice. We deliver our perspective to institutions, advisors, and individuals with a single-minded purpose: to empower investors with the conviction that they can make better-informed decisions and realize success on their own terms. 
 
 Our strategy is to deliver insights and experiences that are essential to the investor workflow. Proprietary data sets, meaningful analytics, independent research, and effe ctive investment strategies are at the core of the powerful digital solutions that investors across our client segments rely on. We have a keen focus on innovation across data, research, product, and delivery so that we can effectively cater to the evolving needs and expectations of investors globally. 
 
 The company has seven operating segments which are presented as the following five reportable segments: Morningstar Data and Analytics, PitchBook, Morningstar Wealth, Morningstar Credit, and Morningstar Retirement. The operating segments of Morningstar Sustainalytics and Morningstar Indexes do not individually meet the quantitative segment reporting thresholds and have been combined and presented as part of Corporate and All Other, which is not a reportable segment. Prior period segment information is presented on a comparable basis to the basis on which current period segment information is presented and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM). For additional information about our segment reporting, refer to Note 8 of the Notes to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 In addition to reviewing revenue by our reportable segments, we review revenue by type. We leverage our proprietary data and research to sell products and services across our portfolio that generate revenue in three primary ways: 
 
 License-base d: The majority of our research, data, and proprietary platforms are accessed via subscription services that grant access on either a per user or enterprise-basis for a specified period of time. 
 
 Asset-based: We charge basis points and other fees for assets under management (AUM) or advisement (AUMA). 
 
 Transaction-based: Revenue is transactional , or one-time, in nature, compared with the recurring revenue streams represented by our license and asset-based products.

 Supplemental Information 
 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP measures: 
 
 consolidated revenue, excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of new accounting standards or revisions to accounting practices (accounting changes), and the effect of foreign currency translations (organic revenue); 
 consolidated operating income, excluding intangible amortization expense, all merger and acquisition- related expenses related to merger, acquisition, and divestiture activity including severance and earn-outs (M A-related expenses) ), and expenses related to the significant reduction and shift of the company's operations in China (adjusted operating income); 
 consolidated operating margin, excluding intangible amortization expense, all M A-related expenses, and expenses related to the significant reduction and shift of the company's operations in China (adjusted operating margin); and 
 cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures (free cash flow). 
 
 These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under GAAP. 
 
 We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business. We exclude revenue from acquired businesses from our organic revenue growth calculation for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition. For divestitures, we exclude revenue in the prior year period for which there is no comparable revenue in the current period. 
 
 We present adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin because we believe they better reflect period-over-period comparisons and improve overall understanding of the underlying performance of the business absent the impact of M A and the shift of the company's operations in China. 
 
 We present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after capital expenditures. Our management team uses free cash flow as a metric to evaluate the health of our business. Free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to any measure required to be reported under GAAP (such as cash provided by (used for) operating, investing, and financing activities).

 Consolidated operating expense increased 8.4 million, or 1.9 , in the third quarter of 2024 and was relatively flat during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the impact of M A-related expenses, amortization, and costs related to the transition of the company's China activities in the prior-year periods, operating expense increased 3.7 in the third quarter and 2.0 during the first nine months of 2024 . Foreign currency translations also had an unfavorable 1.2 million and 0.8 million impact on operating expense during the third quarter of 2024 and the first nine months of 2024, respectively. 
 
 Increases in compensation expense and technology infrastructure costs were mostly offset by decreases in severance expense and amortization expense during the third quarter of 2024 and the impact of SEC settlement-related expenses for DBRS, Inc. in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Compensation expense (which primarily consists of salaries, bonuses, and other company-sponsored benefits) increased 16.2 million in the third quarter of 2024. These higher costs primarily reflect an increase in bonus expense as a result of increased accruals due to favorable performance compared to targets in certain parts of the business.

 T echnology infrastructure costs consisting of expenses related to SaaS-based software subscriptions and cloud computing of 4.0 million were also an operating expense driver during the third quarter of 2024 due to the company's investment in and renewal of various SaaS-based platforms across the business. 
 
 Depreciation expense increased 2.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, driven mainly by higher levels of capitalized software development over the past several years. 
 
 On September 29, 2023, DBRS, Inc. entered into two settlements with the SEC requiring DBRS, Inc. to pay an aggregate of 8.0 million in civil monetary penalties. The DBRS, Inc. SEC settlements resulted in a 6.0 million expense for the third quarter of 2023, bringing the total expense to 8.0 million for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Severance expense decreased 3.9 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period. We recorded 5.0 million of severance expense during the third quarter of 2023 related to targeted reorganizations and headcount reductions in certain parts of the business, including Morningstar Sustainalytics, Morningstar Wealth , and Morningstar Credit . 
 
 Intangible amortization expense decreased 3.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period as certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions became fully amortized. 
 
 Increases in compensation expense, technology infrastructure costs, and depreciation expense were mostly offset by decreases in professional fees and facilities-related expenses during the first nine months of 2024 and the impact of DBRS, Inc. SEC settlement-related expenses during the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Compensation expense, technology infrastructure costs, and depreciation expense increased 23.7 million, 9.4 million, and 7.1 million, respectively, in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above. 
 
 Professional fees and facilities-related expenses decreased 9.3 million and 7.0 million, respectively, during the first nine months of 2024 compared with the prior year period. Professional fees declined due to lower expenses for third-party resources supporting M A integration-related activity. Facilities-related expenses decreased partially due to reduction of office space in certain geographies. 
 
 Cost of Revenue 
 
 Cost of revenue is our largest category of operating expense, representing about half of our total operating expense. Our business relies heavily on human capital, and cost of revenue includes the compensation expense for employees who develop our products and deliver our services. We include compensation expense for approximately 76 of our employees in this category. 
 
 Cost of revenue increased 19.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 25.4 million in the first nine months of 2024. Higher compensation expense of 13.1 million and 17.3 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, were the primarily drivers of the increase due to the factors noted above. Higher technology infrastructure costs also increased 2.1 million and 5.5 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, due to the same factors noted above. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 
 Sales and marketing expense increased 1.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 and was relatively flat during the first nine months of 2024. Advertising and marketing costs increased 1.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 due to higher marketing campaign and conference expense. Professional fees also increased 1.0 million during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expense decreased 12.1 million in the third quarter of 2024. A decline in SEC-related settlement expense and professional fees of 6.0 million and 3.7 million, respectively, were the largest contributors to the decline during the quarter due to the factors noted above.

 General and administrative expense decreased 25.6 million in the first nine months of 2024. A decline in professional fees and 2023 DBRS, Inc. SEC-related settlement expenses of 13.0 million and 8.0 million, respectively, were the largest contributors to the decline due to the factors noted above. Facilities-related expenses also declined 6.7 million during the first nine months of 2024 due to the factors noted above. These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation expense primarily due to an increase in bonus expense and company-sponsored benefits. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation expense increased 2.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 7.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 , driven mainly by higher levels of capitalized software development over the past several years.

Revenue gr ew 4.7 on an organic basis, primarily driven by growth in Morningstar Direct and Morningstar Data.

 Revenue for the PitchBook platform, direct data, and Leveraged Commentary Data (LCD) combined contributed 17.1 million to revenue growth, with revenue increasing 12.5 on a reported and organic basis. Growth was primarily driven by the PitchBook platform with licensed users growing 19.0 . PitchBook clients who were not previously LCD clients drove the majority of the increase in licensed users, although growth continued to reflect the impact of legacy LCD clients who have moved to the PitchBook platform and are now reflected in licensed user counts. PitchBook platform growth drivers were consistent with recent quarters and reflected strength in PitchBook's core investor and advisor client segments, including venture capital, private equity, and investment banks. This was partially offset by continued softness in the corporate client segment, especially with smaller firms with more limited use cases. 
 
 Adjusted operating income increased 11.3 million, or 28.9 , and ad justed operating margin increased 4.2 percentage points for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Adjusted operating income increased 31.0 million, or 29.1 , and adjusted operating margin increased 4.0 percentage points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in margin was partially driven by the forfeiture of stock in the now-terminated PitchBook management bonus plan, which was a compensation vehicle designed primarily to incentivize PitchBook's former CEO. 
 
 Depreciation expense was 7.6 million and 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and 23.3 million and 19.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 We believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations and our Amended 2022 Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next 12 months. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We hold our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments and maintain a conservative investment policy. We invest most of our investment balance in stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar. These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider. 
 
 Approximately 73 of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance as of September 30, 2024 was held by our operations outside the United States, down from 76 as of December 31, 2023. We generally consider our U.S. directly-owned foreign subsidiary earnings to be permanently reinvested . 
 
 We intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth. 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 On May 6, 2022, the company entered into a senior credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement), providing the Company with a five-year multi-currency credit facility with an initial borrowing capacity of up to 1.1 billion, including a 650.0 million term loan and a 450.0 million revolving credit facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement also provided for the issuance of letters of credit and a swingline facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement was amended twice in September 2022 and again most recently in June 2024 (Amended 2022 Credit Agreement) to, among other items, eliminate the options for a second term loan draw and increase both the term loan and revolving credit facility to 650.0 million each, raising the total borrowing capacity to 1.3 billion (Amended 2022 Term Facility and Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, respectively), and to update the reference rate for credit extensions in Canadian dollars. Aside from the increased borrowing capacity, the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement left the 2022 Credit Agreement terms largely unchanged. As of September 30, 2024, our total outstanding debt under the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement was 515.9 million, net of debt issuance costs, with borrowing availability of 650.0 million under the Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility.

Table of Contents 

 The interest rate applicable to any loan under the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement is, at the company's option, either: (i) the applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus an applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 1.00 and 1.48 , based on the company's consolidated leverage ratio or (ii) the lender's base rate plus the applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 0.00 and 0.38 , based on the company's consolidated leverage ratio. 
 
 The portions of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are included in other current and non-current assets, and the portion of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Term Facility is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the Amended 2022 Term Facility. Debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the term of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement. Debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Term Facility are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement. 
 
 Private Placement Debt Offering 
 
 On October 26, 2020, we completed the issuance and sale of 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.32 senior notes due October 26, 2030 (the 2030 Notes), in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds were primarily used to repay a portion of the company's outstanding debt under the company's prior credit facility. Interest on the 2030 Notes is paid semi-annually on each October 30 and A pril 30 during the term of the 2030 Notes and at maturity, with the first interest payment date having occurred on April 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, our total outstanding debt, net of issuance costs, under the 2030 Notes was 348.8 million. 
 
 Compliance with Covenants 
 
 Each of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement and the 2030 Notes include customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants, that require us to maintain specified ratios of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated interest charges and consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, which are evaluated on a quarterly basis. We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of September 30, 2024 , with consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA calculated at approxim ately 1.2x . 
 
 Dividend 
 
 In September 2024, our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of 0.405 per share, or 17.4 million, payable on October 31, 2024 to shareholders of record as of October 4, 2024. We paid 52.0 million in dividends in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 In December 2022, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to 500.0 million in shares of the company's outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2023. This authorization expires on December 31, 2025. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares under the share repurchase program . As of September 30, 2024 we have 498.6 million available for future repurchases under the current share repurchase program. 
 
 Other 
 
 We expect to continue making capital expenditures in the remainder of 2024, primarily for computer hardware and software provided by third parties, internally developed software, and leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations.

 Consolidated Free Cash Flow 
 
 We define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures, and it is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. 
 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Cash provided by operating activities 191.9 130.7 46.8 438.2 178.6 145.4 Capital expenditures (36.1) (29.3) 23.2 (102.1) (89.1) 14.6 Free cash flow 155.8 101.4 53.6 336.1 89.5 275.5 
 
 We generated free cash flow of 155.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 101.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The change reflects a 61.2 million increase in cash provided by operating activities and an increase in capital expenditures compared to the prior-year period. The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily driven by higher cash earnings and improvements in working capital. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the company paid 16.1 million of severance and other costs related to the significant reduction and shift of the Company's operations in China. Excluding the impact of these severance payments and related costs, free cash flow would have been 117.5 million. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, we had free cash flow of 336.1 million compared with 89.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. The change reflects a 259.6 million increase in cash provided by operating activities and an increase in capital expenditures. The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily driven by higher cash earnings and improvements in working capital. Capital expenditures increased primarily due to investment in our product development efforts across our key product areas. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2023, the company made its final 50.0 million payment related to the acquisition of LCD, of which 4.5 million is reflected in operating cash flows and 45.5 million is reflected in financing cash flows. In the second quarter of 2023, the company made the final cash payments of 59.9 million related to the Termination Agreement, which were reflected in operating cash flows. E xcluding the 4.5 million LCD payment within operating cash flow, payments related to the Termination Agreement of 59.9 million, and 26.2 million of severance and other related costs paid for the shift of the company's operations in China, which together totaled 90.6 million, free cash flow would have been 180.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 We discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Annual Report. We also discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report and in Note 2 of the Notes to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. There have not been any material changes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the methodologies applied by management for critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our Annual Report.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates, market prices, or adverse security selection. These accounts may consist of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar. These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider. As of September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance was 601.7 million. Based on our estimates, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio. 
 
 We are subject to risk from fluctuations in the interest rates related to a portion of our long-term debt. The interest rates are based upon the applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR) rate plus an applicable margin for such loans or the lender's base rate plus an applicable m argin for such loans. On an annualized basis, we estimate a 100 basis-point change in the SOFR rate would have a 5.2 million impact on our interest expense based on our outstanding principal balance and SOFR rates at September 30, 2024. 
 
 We are subject to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies from our operations outside of the Unit ed States. We do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency risk.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation and Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 (c) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been or would be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
