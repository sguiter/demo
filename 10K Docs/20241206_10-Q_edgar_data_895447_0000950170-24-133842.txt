 states within the continental United States and in Puerto Rico, as well as through our e-commerce sales channels. We offer customers a broad assortment of primarily branded dress and casual shoes, sandals, boots and athletic footwear and accessories for men, women and children with an emphasis on national name brands through our Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station banners. We are an Indiana corporation that was initially formed in Delaware in 1993 and reincorporated in Indiana in 1996. References to we, us, our and the Company in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to Shoe Carnival, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Shoe Carnival, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Rogan Shoes, Incorporated, SCHC, Inc. and Shoe Carnival Ventures, LLC, and SCLC, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SCHC, Inc. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC for interim financial information and contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present our financial position and the results of our operations and our cash flows for the periods presented. Certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been condensed or omitted as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 . 

million, net of million of cash acquired, which was paid with cash on hand . This included of purchase accounting adjustments which were paid in November 2024. Additional consideration of up to million may be paid by the Company subject to the achievement of performance targets. At the time of the acquisition, Rogan s operated store locations in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois. The Rogan s acquisition advanced our strategy to be the nation s leading family footwear retailer. It immediately positioned us as the market leader in Wisconsin, and it established a store base in Minnesota, creating additional expansion opportunities. Rogan s is being integrated into our Shoe Station banner and our current plan is to brand and operate these stores over time using both the Rogan s and Shoe Station trade names. Rogan s results were included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. Net Sales from our newly acquired Rogan s operations totaled million in the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 and million from February 13, 2024 through November 2, 2024. For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, acquisition-related costs of and , respectively, were expensed as incurred and were included in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. We also recognized a million goodwill measurement period adjustment related to adjusting our deferred income tax positions during third quarter 2024.

Our fair value estimate of the Merchandise Inventories for Rogan s was determined using the Comparative Sales and Replacement Cost methods. Our fair value estimate of the contingent consideration for the Rogan s acquisition was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and other methods that account for the probabilities of various outcomes and was recorded in Other long-term liabilities. Significant assumptions used for the valuation include the discount rate, projected cash flows and calculated volatility. Our fair value estimate related to the identified intangible asset of Rogan s trade name was determined using the Relief from Royalty method, and the significant assumptions used for the valuation include the royalty rate, estimated projected revenues, long-term growth rate and the discount rate. Our fair value estimates related to Rogan s customer relationships were determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings method, and the significant assumptions used for the valuation include projected cash flows, the discount rate and customer attrition rate. Identifiable intangible assets include Rogan s trade name and customer relationships. We assigned an indefinite life to Rogan s trade name; therefore, Goodwill and Rogan s trade name will be charged to expense only if impaired. Impairment reviews will be conducted at least annually and involve a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount. If fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recognized in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Customer relationships are subject to amortization and will be amortized over a period of years. Goodwill and the acquisition-related Intangible Assets will not be deductible for tax purposes.

We invest in publicly traded mutual funds with readily determinable fair values. These Marketable Securities are designed to mitigate volatility in our Consolidated Statements of Income associated with our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. As of November 2, 2024, these Marketable Securities were principally invested in equity-based mutual funds, consistent with the allocation in our deferred compensation plan. To the extent there is a variation in invested funds compared to the total non-qualified deferred compensation plan liability, such fund variance is managed through a stable value mutual fund. We classify these Marketable Securities as current assets because we have the ability to convert the securities into cash at our discretion and these Marketable Securities are not held in a rabbi trust. Changes in these Marketable Securities and deferred compensation plan liabilities are charged to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

Accounting Policy and Performance Obligations We operate as an omnichannel, family footwear retailer and provide the convenience of shopping at our physical stores or shopping online through our e-commerce sales channels. As part of our omnichannel strategy, we offer Shoes 2U, a program that enables us to ship product to a customer s home or selected store if the product is not in stock at a particular store. We also offer buy online, pick up in store services for our customers. Buy online, pick up in store provides the convenience of local pickup for our customers. For our physical stores, we satisfy our performance obligation and control is transferred at the point of sale when the customer takes possession of the products. This also includes the buy online, pick up in store scenario described above and includes sales made via our Shoes 2U program when customers choose to pick up their goods at a physical store. For sales made through our e-commerce sales channels in which the customer chooses home delivery, we transfer control and recognize revenue when the product is shipped. This also includes sales made via our Shoes 2U program when the customer chooses home delivery. We offer our customers sales incentives including coupons, discounts and free merchandise. Sales are recorded net of such incentives and returns and allowances. If an incentive involves free merchandise, that merchandise is recorded as a zero sale and the cost is included in Cost of Sales. Gift card revenue is recognized at the time of redemption. When a customer makes a purchase as part of our rewards program, we allocate the transaction price between the goods purchased and the loyalty reward points and recognize the loyalty revenue based on estimated customer redemptions. Transaction Price and Payment Terms The transaction price is the amount of consideration we expect to receive from our customers and is reduced by any stated promotional discounts at the time of purchase. The transaction price may be variable due to terms that permit customers to exchange or return products for a refund. The implicit contract with the customer reflected in the transaction receipt states the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of each product purchased. The customer agrees to a stated price in the contract that does not vary over the term of the contract and may include revenue to offset shipping costs. Taxes imposed by governmental authorities, such as sales taxes, are excluded from Net Sales. We accept various forms of payment from customers at the point of sale typical for an omnichannel retailer. Payments made for products are generally collected when control passes to the customer, either at the point of sale or at the time the customer order is shipped. For Shoes 2U transactions, customers may order the product at the point of sale. For these transactions, customers pay in advance and unearned revenue is recorded as a contract liability. We recognize the related revenue when control has been transferred to the customer (i.e., when the product is picked up by the customer or shipped to the customer). Unearned revenue related to Shoes 2U was not material to our consolidated financial statements at November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 or October 28, 2023.

of refund liabilities and of right of return assets associated with estimated product returns were recorded in Accrued and Other Liabilities and Merchandise Inventories, respectively, as of November 2, 2024 and February 3, 2024. Approximately of refund liabilities and of right of return assets associated with estimated product returns were recorded in Accrued and Other Liabilities and Merchandise Inventories, respectively, at October 28, 2023. Contract Liabilities The issuance of a gift card is recorded as an increase to contract liabilities and a decrease to contract liabilities when a customer redeems a gift card. Estimated breakage is determined based on historical breakage percentages and recognized as revenue based on expected gift card usage. We do not record breakage revenue when escheat liability to relevant jurisdictions exists. At November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , approximately million, million and million of contract liabilities associated with unredeemed gift cards were recorded in Accrued and Other Liabilities, respectively. We expect the revenue associated with these liabilities to be recognized in proportion to the pattern of customer redemptions within two years. Breakage revenue associated with our gift cards recognized in Net Sales was t material to any of the periods presented. Our Shoe Perks rewards program allows customers to accrue points and provides customers with the opportunity to earn rewards. Points under Shoe Perks are earned primarily by making purchases through any of our omnichannel points of sale. Once a certain threshold of accumulated points is reached, the customer earns a reward certificate, which is redeemable through any of our sales channels. When a Shoe Perks customer makes a purchase, we allocate the transaction price between the goods purchased and the loyalty reward points earned based on the relative standalone selling price. The portion allocated to the points program is recorded as a contract liability for rewards that are expected to be redeemed. We then recognize revenue based on an estimate of when customers redeem rewards, which incorporates an estimate of points expected to expire using historical rates. During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 , approximately and million, respectively, of loyalty rewards were recognized in Net Sales. During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023 , approximately million and million, respectively, of loyalty rewards were recognized in Net Sales. At November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , approximately , and , respectively, of contract liabilities associated with loyalty rewards were recorded in Accrued and Other Liabilities. We expect the revenue associated with these liabilities to be recognized in proportion to the pattern of customer redemptions in less than one year. 

 , and other warehousing and office space. We also enter into leases of equipment and other assets. Substantially all of our leases are operating leases; however, as a result of the acquisition of Rogan s, we also acquired certain assets subject to finance leases. The finance lease assets and related current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities were recorded in Other Noncurrent Assets, Accrued and Other Liabilities and Other long-term liabilities, respectively. Leases with terms of twelve months or less are immaterial and are expensed as incurred, and we did not have any leases with related parties as of November 2, 2024.

Overview of Our Business 
 Shoe Carnival, Inc. is one of the nation s largest omnichannel family footwear retailers. On December 3, 2021, we began operating under two banners: Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station. On February 13, 2024, we furthered our acquisition strategy by acquiring all of the stock of Rogan Shoes, Incorporated Rogan s ). The acquisition of Rogan s added 28 physical stores (25 in Wisconsin, 2 in Minnesota, and 1 in Illinois) to our portfolio, positioned us as the market leader in Wisconsin and established a store base in Minnesota, creating additional expansion opportunities. As previously noted, Rogan s is being integrated into our Shoe Station banner and our current plan is to brand and operate these stores over time using both the Rogan s and Shoe Station trade names. More information about the acquisition of Rogan s can be found in Note 2 Acquisition of Rogan Shoes to our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in PART I, ITEM 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our objective is to be the nation s leading family footwear retailer. Our product assortment, whether shopping in a physical store or through our e-commerce sales channels, is primarily branded footwear and includes dress and casual shoes, sandals, boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes. Our typical physical store carries shoes in two general categories athletics and non-athletics with subcategories for men s, women s and children s, as well as a broad range of accessories. In addition to our physical stores, through our e-commerce sales channels, customers can purchase the same assortment of merchandise in all categories of footwear with expanded options in certain instances. 
 Our stores under the Shoe Carnival banner combine competitive pricing with a high-energy in-store environment that encourages customer participation. Footwear in our Shoe Carnival physical stores is organized by category and brand, creating strong brand statements within the aisles. These brand statements are underscored by branded signage on endcaps and in-line signage throughout the store. Our signage may highlight a vendor s product offerings or sales promotions, or may highlight seasonal or lifestyle statements by grouping similar footwear from multiple vendors. 
 The Shoe Station banner and retail locations, including Rogan s locations, are a complementary retail platform for us to serve a broader base of family footwear customers in both urban and suburban demographics. The Shoe Station concept targets a more affluent family footwear customer and has a strong track record of capitalizing on emerging footwear fashion trends and introducing new brands. Due to the larger average size of our Shoe Station stores and the targeted, more affluent customer, these locations provide a primary destination shopping experience. 
 We believe our distinctive shopping experiences give us various competitive advantages, including increased multiple unit sales; the building of a loyal, repeat customer base; the creation of word-of-mouth advertising; and enhanced sell-through of in-season goods. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 We use judgment in reporting our financial results. This judgment involves estimates based in part on our historical experience and incorporates the impact of the current general economic climate and company-specific circumstances. However, because future events and economic conditions are inherently uncertain, our actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Our accounting policies that require more significant judgments include those with respect to Merchandise Inventories, valuation of long-lived assets, valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets, leases and income taxes. The accounting policies that require more significant judgment are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, and there have been no material changes to those critical accounting policies.

(1) Comparable stores Net Sales is a key performance indicator for us. Comparable stores Net Sales include stores that have been open for 13 full months after such stores grand opening or acquisition prior to the beginning of the period, including those stores that have been relocated, remodeled or rebannered. Therefore, stores recently opened, acquired or permanently closed are not included in comparable stores Net Sales. We generally include e-commerce sales in our comparable stores Net Sales as a result of our omnichannel retailer strategy. Due to our omnichannel retailer strategy, we view e-commerce sales as an extension of our physical stores. E-commerce sales channels associated with a physical store acquisition will not be included in comparable stores Net Sales until the initial physical stores are included. The 21 original Shoe Station stores acquired and the www.shoestation.com e-commerce site that went live in early February 2023 were included in comparable stores Net Sales calculations beginning in first quarter 2023. All Rogan s sales (physical stores and e-commerce) are excluded from our comparable stores Net Sales. 

Our fiscal year is a 52/53 week year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal 2023 consisted of the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2023, while Fiscal 2024 consists of the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025. The 53rd week in Fiscal 2023 caused a one-week shift in our fiscal calendar. As a result, each of our first three quarters in Fiscal 2024 is shifted one week later compared to Fiscal 2023. This one-week shift impacts our year-over-year sales comparisons when there are seasonal sales influences that fall near the respective quarter-end dates. To minimize the effect of this fiscal calendar shift on comparable stores Net Sales, our reported comparable stores Net Sales results for third quarter 2024 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other public disclosures compare the thirteen-week and thirty-nine week periods ended November 2, 2024 to the thirteen-week and thirty-nine week periods ended November 4, 2023. As such, changes in comparable stores Net Sales may not be consistent with changes in Net Sales reported for the fiscal period. 
 The following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of Net Sales for the periods indicated:

Executive Summary for Third Quarter Ended November 2, 2024 
 During third quarter 2024, Net Sales of 306.9 million were down 13.0 million, or 4.1 , compared to third quarter 2023. Due to the calendar shift described above, an important week of the back-to-school season that was included in third quarter 2023 was moved into the second quarter in Fiscal 2024. The net effect of this shift decreased third quarter 2024 Net Sales by approximately 20 million compared to third quarter 2023. In third quarter 2024, Net Sales otherwise increased 7.0 million, or 2.2 , compared to third quarter 2023. This increase was led by Rogan s, which was acquired on February 13, 2024 and delivered third quarter 2024 Net Sales of approximately 22.3 million, and new store growth from Shoe Station stores. 
 On a comparable store basis, which excludes the impact of the calendar shift, Rogan s sales and sales from other new stores, Net Sales were down 4.1 . During third quarter 2024, our comparable stores Net Sales grew in August due to our strong back-to-school performance; however, comparable stores Net Sales declined in September and October due to the impact of two hurricanes on approximately half of our stores and the shopping habits of our customer base in the affected locations and persistently warm weather, which has delayed demand for fall seasonal merchandise. In the quarter, boot sales were down 31 , reflecting approximately half of the comparable stores Net Sales decline in third quarter 2024. Comparable stores Net Sales growth in athletics partially offset these lower boot sales. 
 Long-term gross profit margin expansion has been a key driver of our profit transformation, led by our targeted promotional plans, buying strategies and growth of our customer loyalty program, Shoe Perks. During third quarter 2024, our gross profit margin was above 35 for the 15th consecutive quarter at 36.0 and decreased approximately 80 basis points compared to third quarter 2023, primarily due to higher buying, distribution and occupancy costs BD O from operating more stores and the deleveraging effect of the lower, shifted Net Sales during the quarter. 
 17 

On a year-to-date basis, which now includes the material offsetting impacts of the retail calendar shift, Net Sales in 2024 totaled 939.9 million, an increase of 4.9 versus year-to-date 2023 and gross profit margin was consistent with the prior year. 
 As market conditions softened in September and October, we lowered selling costs at Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station stores. These lower selling expenses reflected optimized advertising spend, driven by our digital-first marketing strategy. In third quarter 2024, our selling, general, and administrative expenses SG A were lower than third quarter 2023 by 3.9 million as these lower store selling expenses more than offset the cost of operating Rogan s stores. While Rogan s costs were an additional expense in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023, those cost increases were mitigated by the synergies captured during third quarter 2024 from completing the integration of Rogan s store operations, marketing, e-commerce platforms, point-of-sale systems, merchandising and back office functions. We currently estimate that Rogan s synergy capture will be over 1 million in Fiscal 2024, with a significant portion of that recognized in third quarter 2024. 
 Third quarter 2024 Operating Income totaled 24.5 million and decreased 12.2 versus third quarter 2023, primarily due to the lower Net Sales from the calendar shift and soft demand in September and October. These declines were partially offset by growth, principally from the Rogan s acquisition and related synergies, as well as lower SG A. 
 Operating Income in third quarter 2024 included 369,000 in merger and integration expenses related to the Rogan s acquisition, of which 248,000 were in Cost of Sales and 121,000 were in SG A. 
 Third quarter 2024 Net Income was 19.2 million, or 0.70 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2023 Net Income of 21.9 million, or 0.80 per diluted share. The decrease reflected the lower Operating Income and a higher effective tax rate. 
 Merchandise Inventories totaled 406.6 million at the end of third quarter 2024, an increase of approximately 38.3 million compared to the end of third quarter 2023, primarily reflecting Rogan s acquired inventory. Merchandise Inventories supporting the Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station bannered stores were approximately 1 lower on a dollar basis at the end of third quarter 2024 compared to the end of third quarter 2023. 
 At the end of third quarter 2024, we had total Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities of 91.1 million. Cash and Cash Equivalents increased 17.3 million compared to the end of third quarter 2023, and cash flows from operations in year-to-date 2024 totaled 58.1 million. Fiscal 2023 year end marked the 19th consecutive year we ended the fiscal year with no debt, and in year-to-date 2024, we continued to fund our operations and growth investments, including the purchase of Rogan s, from operating cash flows and without incurring debt. In year-to-date 2024, we have paid 44.4 million for Rogan s and, based on the purchase price adjustments, we owed another 378,000 that was paid in November 2024. Up to an additional 5.0 million in consideration will be due in 2027 if three-year performance targets are met. 
 Results of Operations for Third Quarter Ended November 2, 2024 Compared to Third Quarter Ended October 28, 2023 
 Net Sales 
 Net Sales were 306.9 million during third quarter 2024, a decrease of 13.0 million or 4.1 , compared to third quarter 2023. The decrease reflected the impact of the calendar shift moving approximately 20 million of Net Sales out of third quarter 2024. Net Sales otherwise increased 7.0 million, or 2.2 , compared to third quarter 2023. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Rogan s, which added Net Sales of 22.3 million in third quarter 2024, and new store growth in the Shoe Station banner, partially offset by a comparable stores Net Sales decline of 4.1 . During third quarter 2024, our comparable stores Net Sales grew in August due to our strong back-to-school performance; however, comparable stores Net Sales declined in September and October due to the impact of two hurricanes on approximately half of our stores and the shopping habits of our customer base in the affected locations and persistently warm weather, which has delayed demand for fall seasonal merchandise. In third quarter 2024, boot sales were down 31 , reflecting approximately half of the comparable stores Net Sales decline in the quarter. E-commerce sales were approximately 11 of merchandise sales in third quarter 2024, compared to 10 in third quarter 2023. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross Profit was 110.4 million during third quarter 2024, a decrease of 7.3 million compared to third quarter 2023. Gross profit margin in third quarter 2024 was 36.0 compared to 36.8 in third quarter 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven by BD O, which increased in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 due to higher occupancy costs associated with operating more stores and the deleveraging effect of lower Net Sales in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin was partially offset by a 50 basis point increase in merchandise margin in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 . 
 18 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A decreased 3.9 million in third quarter 2024 to 85.9 million compared to 89.8 million in third quarter 2023. The decrease in SG A expenses was due primarily to lower selling costs at Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station bannered stores, partially offset by the costs associated with operating the recently acquired Rogan s stores. As a percentage of Net Sales, SG A were 28.0 in third quarter 2024 compared to 28.1 in third quarter 2023. 
 Interest Income and Interest Expense 
 Changes in our interest income and expense increased our income before taxes by 247,000 in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on invested cash balances. 
 Income Taxes 
 The effective income tax rate for third quarter 2024 was 24.7 compared to 23.8 for third quarter 2023. Our provision for income taxes is based on the current estimate of our annual effective tax rate and is adjusted as necessary for quarterly events. The higher effective tax rate in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 was primarily due to discrete adjustments recorded in third quarter 2023 that did not recur in third quarter 2024. For the full 2024 fiscal year, we expect our tax rate to be between 25.6 and 26.0 compared to the 23.7 effective tax rate recognized during the full 2023 fiscal year. 
 Results of Operations Year-to-Date Through November 2, 2024 Compared to Year-to-Date Through October 28, 2023 
 Net Sales 
 Net Sales were 939.9 million during year-to-date 2024 and increased 4.9 compared to year-to-date 2023. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Rogan s, which added Net Sales of 63.9 million, and new store growth in the Shoe Station banner, partially offset by a 3.2 decrease in comparable stores Net Sales. E-commerce sales were approximately 10 of merchandise sales in year-to-date 2024, compared to 9 in year-to-date 2023. Year-to-date 2024 e-commerce sales were favorably impacted by the relaunch of www.shoecarnival.com in third quarter 2023 and the launch of www.shoestation.com in first quarter 2023. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross Profit was 337.1 million during year-to-date 2024, an increase of 15.4 million compared to year-to-date 2023. Gross profit margin was 35.9 in both year-to-date 2024 and year-to-date 2023. This consistency was driven by stable merchandise margins and stable BD O as a percentage of Net Sales in year-to-date 2024 compared to year-to-date 2023. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A increased 11.9 million, or 4.8 , in year-to-date 2024 to 260.0 million compared to 248.1 million in year-to-date 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation-related costs, including compensation costs related to Rogan s, and other Rogan s-related operating expenses in year-to-date 2024, partially offset by other lower selling costs at Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station stores. As a percentage of Net Sales, SG A were 27.7 in both year-to-date 2024 and year-to-date 2023. 
 Interest Income and Interest Expense 
 Changes in our interest income and expense increased our income before taxes by 675,000 in year-to-date 2024 compared to year-to-date 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on invested cash balances. 
 Income Taxes 
 The effective income tax rate for year-to-date 2024 was 25.5 compared to 23.0 for year-to-date 2023. The higher effective tax rate in year-to-date 2024 compared to year-to-date 2023 was due to the decrease in tax benefits from share-settled equity awards in year-to-date 2024 and a state deferred tax benefit and other discrete adjustments included in year-to-date 2023 that did not recur in Fiscal 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are 91.1 million of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities on hand at the end of third quarter 2024, cash generated from operations and availability under our 100 million Credit Agreement. We believe our resources will be sufficient to fund our cash needs, as they arise, for at least the next 12 months. Our primary uses of cash are normally for working capital, which are principally inventory purchases, investments in our stores, such as rebanners and new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution center initiatives, lease payments associated with our real estate leases, potential dividend payments, potential share 
 19 

repurchases under our share repurchase program and the financing of capital projects, including investments in new systems. As part of our growth strategy, we have also pursued strategic acquisitions of other footwear retailers. 
 Cash Flow - Operating Activities 
 Net cash generated from operating activities was 58.1 million in year-to-date 2024 compared to 69.4 million in year-to-date 2023. The change in operating cash flow was primarily driven by the timing of inventory and prepaid contracts payments. 
 Working capital increased on a year-over-year basis and totaled 391.3 million at November 2, 2024 compared to 340.6 million at October 28, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher Merchandise Inventories and Accounts Receivable levels due to the acquisition of Rogan s and a higher cash balance, partially offset by higher Accounts Payable. Our current ratio was 3.9 as of November 2, 2024 compared to 3.8 as of October 28, 2023. 
 Cash Flow Investing Activities 
 Our cash outflows for investing activities are normally for capital expenditures. During year-to-date 2024 and 2023, we expended 24.8 million and 43.6 million, respectively, for the purchase of Property and Equipment, primarily related to store remodels and rebanners and opening four new Shoe Station stores. 
 Our Rogan s acquisition in first quarter 2024 resulted in the payment of initial cash consideration of 44.4 million, net of cash acquired, during year-to-date 2024. Additional information regarding the Rogan s acquisition, including information on the additional contingent consideration of up to 5.0 million, can be found in Note 2 Acquisition of Rogan Shoes to our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in PART I, ITEM 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We invest in publicly traded mutual funds designed to mitigate income statement volatility associated with our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The balance of these Marketable Securities was 13.9 million at November 2, 2024, compared to 12.2 million at February 3, 2024 and 11.2 million at October 28, 2023. Additional information can be found in Note 5 Fair Value Measurements to our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in PART I, ITEM 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Cash Flow Financing Activities 
 Our cash outflows for financing activities are typically for cash dividend payments, share repurchases or payments on our Credit Agreement. Shares of our common stock can be either acquired as part of a publicly announced repurchase program or withheld by us in connection with employee payroll tax withholding upon the vesting of stock-based compensation awards that are settled in shares. Our cash inflows from financing activities generally reflect stock issuances to employees under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and borrowings under our Credit Agreement. 
 
 During year-to-date 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 11.6 million compared to 17.2 million during year-to-date 2023. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repurchase of 5.4 million of shares in year-to-date 2023 under our Board of Directors authorized share repurchase program compared to none in year-to-date 2024 and the decrease in shares surrendered by employees to pay taxes on stock-based compensation awards, partially offset by increased dividend payments. 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 On March 23, 2022, we entered into a 100 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement is collateralized by our inventory, expires on March 23, 2027, and uses a Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as quoted by The Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the basis for financing charges. Material covenants associated with the Credit Agreement require that we maintain a minimum net worth of 250 million and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with these covenants as of November 2, 2024. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictions. However, as long as our consolidated EBITDA is positive and there are either no or low borrowings outstanding, we expect these restrictions would have no impact on our ability to pay cash dividends, execute share repurchases or facilitate acquisitions from cash on hand. The Credit Agreement stipulates that cash dividends and share repurchases of 15 million or less per fiscal year can be made without restriction as long as there is no default or event of default before and immediately after such distributions. We are also permitted to make acquisitions and pay cash dividends or repurchase shares in excess of 15 million in a fiscal year provided that (a) no default or event of default exists before and immediately after the transaction and (b) on a proforma basis, the ratio of (i) the sum of (A) our consolidated funded indebtedness plus (B) three times our consolidated rental expense to (ii) the sum of (A) our consolidated EBITDA plus (B) our consolidated rental expense is less than 3.5 to 1.0. Among other restrictions, the Credit Agreement also limits our ability to incur additional secured or unsecured debt to 20 million. 
 
 20 

The Credit Agreement bears interest, at our option, at (1) the agent bank s base rate plus 0.0 to 1.0 or (2) Adjusted Term SOFR plus 0.9 to 1.9 , depending on our achievement of certain performance criteria. A commitment fee is charged at 0.2 to 0.3 per annum, depending on our achievement of certain performance criteria, on the unused portion of the lenders commitment. During year-to-date 2024, we did not borrow or repay funds under the Credit Agreement. Letters of credit outstanding were 1.0 million at November 2, 2024 and our borrowing capacity was 99.0 million. 
 
 The terms net worth , consolidated interest coverage ratio , consolidated funded indebtedness , consolidated rental expense , consolidated EBITDA , base rate and Adjusted Term SOFR are defined in the Credit Agreement. 
 See Note 9 Debt in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in PART II, ITEM 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 for a further discussion of our Credit Agreement and its covenants. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Capital expenditures for Fiscal 2024, including actual expenditures in year-to-date 2024, are expected to be between 30 million and 35 million, with approximately 20 million to 25 million to be used for new and rebannered stores and remodels and approximately 10 million to 15 million for upgrades to our Evansville distribution center and e-commerce sales channels, various other store improvements, continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities. The resources allocated to projects are subject to near-term changes depending on the supply chain and potential inflationary and other macroeconomic impacts. Furthermore, the actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures for store operations depends in part on the number of stores opened, rebannered, remodeled and relocated and the amount of lease incentives, if any, received from landlords. The number of new store openings and relocations will be dependent upon, among other things, the availability of desirable locations, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending. 
 Store Portfolio 
 We opened four new Shoe Station branded stores, permanently closed one Shoe Carnival branded store and acquired 28 Rogan s stores, which over time are being integrated into our Shoe Station banner, in year-to-date 2024. Increasing market penetration by adding new stores is a key component of our growth strategy. We currently have 431 stores and are targeting operating over 500 stores in 2028. We believe our current store footprint provides for growth in new markets within the United States as well as fill-in opportunities within existing markets. Since our acquisition of Shoe Station in December 2021, we have gained valuable insights about the Shoe Station customer base and have defined markets where we believe a Shoe Station bannered store may outperform our current Shoe Carnival bannered store located in those markets. The Company advanced its store rebanner growth strategy during third quarter 2024, with seven Shoe Carnival stores being rebannered to Shoe Station stores. Ten stores have now been rebannered. Through third quarter 2024, rebannered stores have outperformed expectations, and based on the successful results of the strategy to date, we plan to rebanner 25 additional Shoe Carnival stores to Shoe Station stores in the first half of Fiscal 2025. Future store growth may continue to be impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty, our ability to identify desirable locations and/or acquisition partners and increased focus on our emerging store rebanner strategy. 
 Dividends and Share Repurchases 
 On September 17, 2024, the Board of Directors approved the payment of a third quarter 2024 cash dividend paid to our shareholders. The quarterly cash dividend of 0.135 per share was paid on October 21, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 7, 2024. In third quarter 2023, the dividend paid was 0.120 per share. During year-to-date 2024 and 2023, we returned 11.0 million and 8.9 million, respectively, to our shareholders through our quarterly cash dividends. The declaration and payment of any future dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. 
 On December 14, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 50.0 million of our outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2024 (the 2024 Share Repurchase Program ). The purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time-to-time through December 31, 2024 and in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program may be amended, suspended, or discontinued at any time and does not commit us to repurchase shares of our common stock. We have funded, and intend to continue to fund, share repurchases from cash on hand, and any shares acquired will be available for stock-based compensation awards and other corporate purposes. The actual number and value of the shares to be purchased will depend on the performance of our stock price and other market and economic factors. 
 No share repurchases have been made to date in Fiscal 2024. During year-to-date 2023, we repurchased 230,696 shares of common stock at a total cost of 5.4 million. 
 21 

Our Credit Agreement permits the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares, subject to certain covenants and restrictions. See Credit Agreement above and Note 9 Debt to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in PART II, ITEM 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 for a further discussion of the Credit Agreement, its covenants and restrictions regarding dividends and share repurchases and other matters. The Credit Agreement s covenants and restrictions did not change during year-to-date 2024. 
 Seasonality 
 We have three distinct peak selling periods: Easter, back-to-school and Christmas. Our operating results depend significantly upon the sales generated during these periods. To prepare for our peak shopping seasons, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry during other periods of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products or a supply chain disruption that reduces inventory availability during these peak shopping seasons could reduce our Net Sales and Gross Profit and negatively affect our profitability. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 4 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in PART I, ITEM 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements when adopted. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk in that the interest payable under the Credit Agreement is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates. We do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in market interest rates. We had no borrowings outstanding during year-to-date 2024. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of November 2, 2024, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 On February 13, 2024, we acquired all of the stock of Rogan s, a privately-held, 53-year-old work and family footwear company. Under the SEC s rules and regulations, we are currently integrating Rogan s into management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025. 
 There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended November 2, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In determining the number of Shares to be counted against this share reserve in connection with any Award, the following rules shall apply: 
 (i)	 Where the number of Shares subject to an Award is variable on the Grant Date, the number of Shares to be counted against the share reserve shall be the maximum number of Shares that could be received under that particular Award, until such time as it can be determined that only a lesser number of shares could be earned or received. 
 (ii)	 Where two or more types of Awards are granted to a Participant in tandem with each other, such that the exercise of one type of Award with respect to a number of Shares cancels at least an equal number of Shares of the other, the number of Shares to be counted against the share reserve shall be the largest number of Shares that would be counted against the share reserve under either of the Awards. 
 
 (iii)	Shares subject to Substitute Awards shall not be counted against the share reserve, nor shall they reduce the Shares authorized for grant to a Participant in any calendar year. 
 
 (iv)	Awards that will be settled solely in cash shall not be counted against the share reserve, nor shall they reduce the Shares authorized for grant to a Participant in any calendar year. 
 
 (b)	 Effect of Forfeitures and Other Actions . Any Shares subject to an Award, or to an award granted under the Prior Plan that is outstanding on the Effective Date of this Plan (a Prior Plan Award ), that expires, is cancelled or forfeited or is settled for cash shall, to the extent of such cancellation, forfeiture, expiration or cash settlement, again become available for Awards under this Plan, and the share reserve under Section 4(a) shall be correspondingly replenished, with such increase based on the same number of shares by which the applicable share reserve was decreased upon the grant of the applicable award. The following Shares shall not, however, again become available for Awards or replenish the share reserve under Section 4(a): (i) Shares tendered (either actually or by attestation) by the Participant or withheld by the Company in payment of the exercise price of a stock option issued under this Plan or the Prior Plan, (ii) Shares tendered (either actually or by attestation) by the Participant or withheld by the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to any Award or Prior Plan Award, (iii) Shares repurchased by the Company with proceeds received from the exercise of a stock option issued under this Plan or the Prior Plan, and (iv) Shares subject to a stock appreciation right award issued under this Plan or the Prior Plan that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of that award upon its exercise. 
 
 (c) Effect of Plans Operated by Acquired Companies . If a company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary or with which the Company or any Subsidiary combines has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by shareholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall supplement the Share reserve under Section 4(a). Awards using such available shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who were not Employees or Non-Employee Directors prior to such acquisition or combination. 
 7 

(d)	 No Fractional Shares . Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the number of Shares subject to an Award shall always be a whole number. No fractional Shares may be issued under the Plan, but the Committee may, in its discretion, adopt any rounding convention it deems suitable or pay cash in lieu of any fractional Share in settlement of an Award. 
 
 (e)	 Limits on Awards to Non-Employee Directors . The aggregate grant date fair value (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable in the United States) of all Awards granted during any calendar year to any Non-Employee Director, together with the amount of any cash fees or retainers paid to such Non-Employee Director during such calendar year with respect to such individual s Service as a Non-Employee Director, in each case excluding any supplemental Awards granted or cash fees or retainers paid to a Non-Employee Director with respect to such individual s Service as the Chairman of the Board, shall not exceed 500,000. 
 
 5.	 Eligibility . Participation in the Plan is limited to Service Providers. Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to Employees. 
 6.	 General Terms of Awards . 
 (a) Award Agreement . Each Award shall be evidenced by an Agreement setting forth the amount of the Award together with such other terms and conditions applicable to the Award (and not inconsistent with the Plan) as determined by the Committee. An Award to a Participant may be made singly or in combination with any form of Award. Two types of Awards may be made in tandem with each other such that the exercise of one type of Award with respect to a number of Shares reduces the number of Shares subject to the related Award by at least an equal amount. 
 (b) Vesting and Term . Each Agreement shall set forth the period until the applicable Award is scheduled to expire (which shall not be more than ten years from the Grant Date), and the applicable vesting conditions and any applicable performance period. The Committee may provide in an Agreement for such vesting conditions and timing as it may determine. 
 (c) Transferability . Except as provided in this Section 6(c), (i) during the lifetime of a Participant, only the Participant or the Participant s guardian or legal representative may exercise an Option or SAR, or receive payment with respect to any other Award; and (ii) no Award may be sold, assigned, transferred, exchanged or encumbered, voluntarily or involuntarily, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempted transfer in violation of this Section 6(c) shall be of no effect. The Committee may, however, provide in an Agreement or otherwise that an Award (other than an Incentive Stock Option) may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order or may be transferable by gift to any family member (as defined in General Instruction A.1(a)(5) to Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933) of the Participant. Any Award held by a transferee shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to that Award immediately before the transfer thereof. For purposes of any provision of the Plan relating to notice to a Participant or to acceleration or termination of an Award upon the death or termination of Service of a Participant, the references to Participant shall mean the original grantee of an Award and not any transferee. 
 (d) Designation of Beneficiary . To the extent permitted by the Committee, a Participant may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise any Award or receive a payment under any Award that is exercisable or payable on or after the Participant s death. Any such designation shall be on a form approved by the Company and shall be effective upon its receipt by the Company. 
 8 

(e)	 Termination of Service . 
 (i)	Unless otherwise provided in an applicable Agreement or another then-effective written agreement between a Participant and the Company, and subject to Section 12 of this Plan, if a Participant s Service with the Company and all of its Affiliates terminates, the following provisions shall apply for Option and SAR Awards (in all cases subject to the scheduled expiration of an Option or SAR Award, as applicable): 
 (A)	Upon termination of Service for any reason, all unvested and unexercisable portions of any outstanding Option and SAR Awards shall be immediately forfeited without consideration. 
 (B)	Upon termination of Service for Cause, all rights under any Option and SAR Awards granted to such Participant shall terminate immediately, and the Participant shall (unless the Committee in its sole discretion waives this requirement) repay to the Company within 10 days the amount of any gain realized by the Participant upon any exercise within the 90-day period prior to the termination of Service of any Options or SARs granted to such Participant. 
 (C)	Upon termination of Service by reason of death, Disability or Retirement, the currently vested and exercisable portions of Option and SAR Awards may be exercised at any time during the remaining term of such Option or SAR Award, or, in the case of Incentive Stock Options, during such shorter period as the Committee may determine and so provide in the applicable Agreement. 
 (D)	Upon termination of Service for any reason other than those set forth in subsections (B) and (C) above, the currently vested and exercisable portions of Option and SAR Awards may be exercised for a period of 90 days after the date of such termination, and in no event after the expiration date of the Option or SAR Award. 
 (ii)	Unless otherwise provided in an applicable Agreement or another then-effective written agreement between a Participant and the Company, and subject to Section 12 of this Plan, if a Participant s Service with the Company and all of its Affiliates terminates, the following provisions shall apply for Full Value Awards: 
 (A)	Upon termination of Service by reason of death or Disability, 
 (x) 	all unvested portions of any outstanding Full Value Awards subject to only service-based vesting conditions shall vest in full immediately upon such termination; and 
 (y) 	for any outstanding Full Value Awards subject to performance-based vesting conditions at the time of such termination, such Full Value Awards shall vest at the end of the applicable performance period based on actual performance at the end of such performance period. 
 (B)	If a Participant s Service is terminated by the Company without Cause, or if a Participant subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act voluntarily terminates his or her Service for Good Reason, 
 9 

(x) 	all unvested portions of any outstanding Full Value Awards subject to only service-based vesting conditions shall vest in full immediately upon such termination; and 
 (y) 	for any outstanding Full Value Awards subject to performance-based vesting conditions at the time of such termination, a pro rata portion of such Full Value Awards shall vest at the end of the applicable performance period based on actual performance at the end of such performance period and the number of full months that had elapsed since the beginning of the performance period at the time of such termination. 
 (C)	Upon termination of Service by reason of Retirement, 
 (x) 	the Ratable Portion of any outstanding Full Value Awards subject to only service-based vesting conditions shall immediately vest upon such termination; and 
 (y) 	for any outstanding Full Value Awards subject to performance-based vesting conditions at the time of such termination, a pro rata portion of such Full Value Awards shall vest at the end of the applicable performance period based on actual performance at the end of such performance period and the number of full months that had elapsed since the beginning of the performance period at the time of such termination. 
 (D)	Upon termination of Service for any reason other than as set forth in subsections (A), (B) and (C) above, all unvested portions of any outstanding Full Value Awards shall be immediately forfeited without consideration. 
 For purposes of this Section 6(e)(ii), Ratable Portion shall be determined with respect to each separate Full Value Award and shall be equal to (x) the number of Shares covered by such Full Value Award multiplied by the portion of the vesting period that expired at the date of the Participant s termination of Service, measured on the basis of full months, reduced by (y) the number of Shares covered by such Full Value Award that had previously vested as of the date of the Participant s termination of Service. 
 (f)	 Rights as Shareholder . No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by an Award unless and until the date the Participant becomes the holder of record of the Shares, if any, to which the Award relates. 
 (g) Performance-Based Awards . Any Award may be granted as a Performance-Based Award if the Committee establishes one or more measures of corporate, business unit or individual performance which must be attained, and the performance period over which the specified performance is to be attained, as a condition to the grant, vesting, exercisability, lapse of restrictions and/or settlement in cash or Shares of such Award. In connection with any such Award, the Committee shall determine the extent to which performance measures have been attained and other applicable terms and conditions have been satisfied, and the degree to which the grant, vesting, exercisability, lapse of restrictions and/or settlement of such Award has been earned. The Committee shall also have the authority to provide, in an Agreement or otherwise, for the modification of a performance period and/or adjustments or waivers of the achievement of performance goals. 
 (h)	 Dividends and Dividend Equivalents . No dividends, dividend equivalents or distributions will be paid with respect to Shares subject to an Option or SAR Award. Any dividends or distributions payable with respect to Shares that are subject to the unvested portion of a Restricted Stock Award will be subject to the same restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the Shares to which such dividends or distributions relate. In its discretion, the Committee may provide in an Award Agreement for a Stock Unit Award or an Other 
 10 

Stock-Based Award that the Participant will be entitled to receive dividend equivalents, based on dividends actually declared and paid on outstanding Shares, on the units or other Share equivalents subject to the Stock Unit Award or Other Stock-Based Award, and such dividend equivalents will be subject to the same restrictions, risk of forfeiture and payment timing as the units or other Share equivalents to which such dividend equivalents relate. The additional terms of any such dividend equivalents will be as set forth in the applicable Agreement, including the form of payment and whether such dividend equivalents will be credited with interest or deemed to be reinvested in additional units or Share equivalents. Any Shares issued or issuable during the term of this Plan as the result of the reinvestment of dividends or the deemed reinvestment of dividend equivalents in connection with an Award or a Prior Plan Award shall be counted against, and replenish upon any subsequent forfeiture, the Plan s share reserve as provided in Section 4. 
 
 7.	 Stock Option Awards . 
 (a)	 Type and Exercise Price . The Agreement pursuant to which an Option Award is granted shall specify whether the Option is an Incentive Stock Option or a Non-Qualified Stock Option. The exercise price at which each Share subject to an Option Award may be purchased shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Agreement, and shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date, except in the case of Substitute Awards (to the extent consistent with Code Section 409A and, in the case of Incentive Stock Options, Code Section 424). 
 (b)	 Payment of Exercise Price . The purchase price of the Shares with respect to which an Option Award is exercised shall be payable in full at the time of exercise. The purchase price may be paid in cash or in such other manner as the Committee may permit, including by payment under a broker-assisted sale and remittance program, by withholding Shares otherwise issuable to the Participant upon exercise of the Option or by delivery to the Company of Shares (by actual delivery or attestation) already owned by the Participant (in each case, such Shares having a Fair Market Value as of the date the Option is exercised equal to the purchase price of the Shares being purchased). Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Participant who is a Director or an executive officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act shall be permitted to pay the exercise price of an Option, or continue any extension of credit with respect to the exercise price of an Option, with a loan from the Company or a loan arranged by the Company in violation of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act. 
 (c)	 Exercisability and Expiration . Each Option Award shall be exercisable in whole or in part on the terms provided in the Agreement. No Option Award shall be exercisable at any time after its scheduled expiration. When an Option Award is no longer exercisable, it shall be deemed to have terminated. 
 (d)	 Incentive Stock Options . 
 (i)	An Option Award will constitute an Incentive Stock Option Award only if the Participant receiving the Option Award is an Employee, and only to the extent that (A) it is so designated in the applicable Agreement and (B) the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the Option Award s Grant Date) of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Option Awards held by the Participant first become exercisable in any calendar year (under the Plan and all other plans of the Company and its Affiliates) does not exceed 100,000 or such other amount specified by the Code. To the extent an Option Award granted to a Participant exceeds this limit, the Option Award shall be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option Award. The maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Option Awards under the Plan shall be the total number of Shares in the Plan s share reserve as specified in the first sentence of Section 4(a), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 12(a). 
 11 

(ii)	No Participant may receive an Incentive Stock Option Award under the Plan if, immediately after the grant of such Award, the Participant would own (after application of the rules contained in Code Section 424(d)) Shares possessing more than 10 of the total combined Voting Power of all classes of stock of the Company or an Affiliate, unless (A) the per Share exercise price for such Award is at least 110 of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date and (B) such Award will expire no later than five years after its Grant Date. 
 
 (iii)	For purposes of continued Service by a Participant who has been granted an Incentive Stock Option Award, no approved leave of absence may exceed three months unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is provided by statute or contract. If reemployment is not so provided, then on the date six months following the first day of such leave, any Incentive Stock Option held by the Participant shall cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and shall be treated for tax purposes as a Non-Qualified Stock Option. 
 (iv)	If an Incentive Stock Option Award is exercised after the expiration of the exercise periods that apply for purposes of Code Section 422, or otherwise fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, such Option shall thereafter be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option. 
 8.	 Stock Appreciation Right Awards . 
 	(a) Nature of Award . An Award of Stock Appreciation Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions as are determined by the Committee, and shall provide a Participant the right to receive upon exercise of the SAR Award all or a portion of the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise of the SAR Award of the number of Shares as to which the SAR Award is being exercised, over (ii) the aggregate exercise price for such number of Shares. The per Share exercise price for any SAR Award shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the applicable Agreement, and shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date, except in the case of Substitute Awards (to the extent consistent with Code Section 409A). 
 	(b) Exercise of SAR . Each SAR Award may be exercisable in whole or in part at the times, on the terms and in the manner provided in the Agreement. No SAR Award shall be exercisable at any time after its scheduled expiration. When a SAR Award is no longer exercisable, it shall be deemed to have terminated. Upon exercise of a SAR Award, payment to the Participant shall be made at such time or times as shall be provided in the Agreement in the form of cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares as determined by the Committee. The Agreement may provide for a limitation upon the amount or percentage of the total appreciation on which payment (whether in cash and/or Shares) may be made in the event of the exercise of a SAR Award. 
 9.	 Restricted Stock Awards . 
 (a)	 Vesting and Consideration . Shares subject to a Restricted Stock Award shall be subject to vesting and the lapse of applicable restrictions based on such conditions or factors, including the achievement of specified performance goals, and occurring over such period of time as the Committee may determine in its discretion. The Committee may provide whether any consideration other than Services must be received by the Company or any Affiliate as a condition precedent to the grant of a Restricted Stock Award, and may correspondingly provide for Company reacquisition or repurchase rights if such additional consideration has been required and some or all of a Restricted Stock Award does not vest. 
 (b)	 Shares Subject to Restricted Stock Awards . Unvested Shares subject to a Restricted Stock Award shall be evidenced by a book-entry in the name of the Participant with the Company s transfer agent or by one or more Stock certificates issued in the name of the Participant. Any such Stock certificate shall 
 12 

be deposited with the Company or its designee, together with an assignment separate from the certificate, in blank, signed by the Participant, and bear an appropriate legend referring to the restricted nature of the Restricted Stock evidenced thereby. Any book-entry shall be subject to comparable restrictions and corresponding stop transfer instructions. Upon the vesting of Shares of Restricted Stock, and the Company s determination that any necessary conditions precedent to the release of vested Shares (such as satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and compliance with applicable legal requirements) have been satisfied, such vested Shares shall be made available to the Participant in such manner as may be prescribed or permitted by the Committee. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or an applicable Agreement, a Participant with a Restricted Stock Award shall have all the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote the Shares of Restricted Stock. 
 10.	 Stock Unit Awards . 
 (a)	 Vesting and Consideration . A Stock Unit Award shall be subject to vesting and the lapse of applicable restrictions based on such conditions or factors and occurring over such period of time as the Committee may determine in its discretion. If vesting of a Stock Unit Award is conditioned on the achievement of specified performance goals, the extent to which they are achieved over the specified performance period shall determine the number of Stock Units that will be earned and eligible to vest, which may be greater or less than the target number of Stock Units stated in the Agreement. The Committee may provide whether any consideration other than Services must be received by the Company or any Affiliate as a condition precedent to the settlement of a Stock Unit Award. 
 (b) Payment of Award . Following the vesting of a Stock Unit Award, and the Company s determination that any necessary conditions precedent to the settlement of the Award (such as satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and compliance with applicable legal requirements) have been satisfied, settlement of the Award and payment to the Participant shall be made at such time or times in the form of cash, Shares (which may themselves be considered Restricted Stock under the Plan) or a combination of cash and Shares as determined by the Committee. 
 11.	 Other Stock-Based Awards . The Committee may from time to time grant Shares and other Awards that are valued by reference to and/or payable in whole or in part in Shares under the Plan. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards, which shall be consistent with the terms and purposes of the Plan. The Committee may direct the Company to issue Shares subject to restrictive legends and/or stop transfer instructions that are consistent with the terms and conditions of the Award to which the Shares relate. 
 
 12.	 Changes in Capitalization, Corporate Transactions, Change in Control . 
 
 (a)	 Adjustments for Changes in Capitalization . In the event of any equity restructuring (within the meaning of FASB ASC Topic 718) that causes the per share value of Shares to change, such as a stock dividend, stock split, spinoff, rights offering or recapitalization through an extraordinary dividend, the Committee shall make such adjustments as it deems equitable and appropriate to (i) the aggregate number and kind of Shares or other securities issued or reserved for issuance under the Plan, (ii) the number and kind of Shares or other securities subject to outstanding Awards, (iii) the exercise price of outstanding Options and SARs, and (iv) any maximum limitations prescribed by the Plan with respect to certain types of Awards or the grants to individuals of certain types of Awards. In the event of any other change in corporate capitalization, including a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or partial or complete liquidation of the Company, such equitable adjustments described in the foregoing sentence may be made as determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights of Participants. In either case, any such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan. No adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 12(a) in connection with the conversion of any 
 13 

convertible securities of the Company, or in a manner that would cause Incentive Stock Options to violate Section 422(b) of the Code or cause an Award to be subject to adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. 
 
 (b)	 Corporate Transactions . Unless otherwise provided in an applicable Agreement or another written agreement between a Participant and the Company, the following provisions shall apply to outstanding Awards in the event of a Change in Control that involves a Corporate Transaction. 
 
 (i)		 Continuation, Assumption or Replacement of Awards . In the event of a Corporate Transaction, then the surviving or successor entity (or its Parent) may continue, assume or replace Awards outstanding as of the date of the Corporate Transaction (with such adjustments as may be required or permitted by Section 12(a)), and such Awards or replacements therefor shall remain outstanding and be governed by their respective terms, subject to Section 12(b)(iv) below. A surviving or successor entity may elect to continue, assume or replace only some Awards or portions of Awards. For purposes of this Section 12(b)(i), an Award shall be considered assumed or replaced if, in connection with the Corporate Transaction and in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A (and Code Section 424 if the Award is an ISO), either (A) the contractual obligations represented by the Award are expressly assumed by the surviving or successor entity (or its Parent) with appropriate adjustments to the number and type of securities subject to the Award and the exercise price thereof that preserves the intrinsic value of the Award existing at the time of the Corporate Transaction, or (B) the Participant has received a comparable equity-based award that preserves the intrinsic value of the Award existing at the time of the Corporate Transaction and contains terms and conditions that are substantially similar to those of the Award. 
 
 (ii)	 Acceleration . If and to the extent that outstanding Awards under the Plan are not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then (A) all outstanding Options and SARs shall become fully vested and exercisable for such period of time prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction as is deemed fair and equitable by the Committee, and shall terminate at the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, (B) all outstanding Full Value Awards shall fully vest immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, and (C) to the extent vesting of any Award is subject to satisfaction of specified performance goals, the portion of such Award that shall be deemed fully vested for purposes of this Section 12(b)(ii) shall be based on performance as of the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, with the performance goals appropriately adjusted to reflect the portion of the performance period that has elapsed as of the effective time of the Corporate Transaction. The Committee shall provide written notice of the period of accelerated exercisability of Options and SARs to all affected Participants. The exercise of any Option or SAR whose exercisability is accelerated as provided in this Section 12(b)(ii) shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Corporate Transaction and shall be effective only immediately before such consummation. 
 
 (iii)	 Payment for Awards . If and to the extent that outstanding Awards under the Plan are not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Committee may provide that some or all of such outstanding Awards shall be canceled at or immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction in exchange for payments to the holders as provided in this Section 12(b)(iii). The Committee will not be required to treat all Awards similarly for purposes of this Section 12(b)(iii). The payment for any Award canceled shall be in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (A) the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Committee) of the consideration that would otherwise be received in the Corporate Transaction for the number of Shares subject to the Award, and (B) the aggregate exercise price (if any) for the Shares subject to such Award. If the amount determined pursuant to the preceding sentence is not a positive number with respect to any Award, such Award may be canceled pursuant to this Section 12(b)(iii) without payment of any kind to the affected Participant. With respect to an Award whose vesting is subject to the satisfaction of specified performance 
 14 

goals, the number of Shares subject to such an Award for purposes of this Section 12(b)(iii) shall be the number of Shares as to which the Award would have been deemed fully vested for purposes of Section 12(b)(ii). Payment of any amount under this Section 12(b)(iii) shall be made in such form, on such terms and subject to such conditions as the Committee determines in its discretion, which may or may not be the same as the form, terms and conditions applicable to payments to the Company s shareholders in connection with the Corporate Transaction, and may, in the Committee s discretion, include subjecting such payments to vesting conditions comparable to those of the Award canceled, subjecting such payments to escrow or holdback terms comparable to those imposed upon the Company s shareholders under the Corporate Transaction, or calculating and paying the present value of payments that would otherwise be subject to escrow or holdback terms. 
 
 (iv)	 Termination After a Corporate Transaction . If and to the extent that Awards are continued, assumed or replaced under the circumstances described in Section 12(b)(i), and if within 24 months after the Corporate Transaction a Participant experiences an involuntary termination of Service for reasons other than Cause, or in the case of Participants subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act voluntarily terminates his or her Service for Good Reason, then (A) outstanding Option and SAR Awards issued to the Participant that are not yet fully exercisable shall immediately become exercisable in full and shall remain exercisable for one year following the Participant s termination of Service, and (B) any Full Value Awards that are not yet fully vested shall immediately vest in full (with vesting in full for a Performance-Based Award determined as provided in Section 12(b)(ii), except that the proportionate vesting amount will be determined with respect to the portion of the performance period during which the Participant was a Service Provider). 
 
 (c)	 Other Change in Control . In the event of a Change in Control that does not involve a Corporate Transaction, the Committee may, in its discretion, take such action as it deems appropriate with respect to outstanding Awards, which may include: (A) providing for the cancellation of any Award in exchange for payments in a manner similar to that provided in Section 12(b)(iii) or (B) making such adjustments to the Awards then outstanding as the Committee deems appropriate to reflect such Change in Control, which may include the acceleration of vesting in full or in part. The Committee will not be required to treat all Awards similarly in such circumstances, and may include such further provisions and limitations in any Award Agreement as it may deem equitable and in the best interests of the Company. 
 
 (d) Dissolution or Liquidation . Unless otherwise provided in an applicable Agreement, in the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Committee will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. An Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. 
 
 13.	 Plan Participation and Service Provider Status . Status as a Service Provider shall not be construed as a commitment that any Award will be made under the Plan to that Service Provider or to eligible Service Providers generally. Nothing in the Plan or in any Agreement or related documents shall confer upon any Service Provider or Participant any right to continued Service with the Company or any Affiliate, nor shall it interfere with or limit in any way any right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate the person s Service at any time with or without Cause or change such person s compensation, other benefits, job responsibilities or title. 
 
 14.	 Tax Withholding . The Company or any Affiliate, as applicable, shall have the right to (i) withhold from any cash payment under the Plan or any other compensation owed to a Participant an amount sufficient to cover any required withholding taxes related to the grant, vesting, exercise or settlement of an Award, and (ii) require a Participant or other person receiving Shares under the Plan to pay a cash amount sufficient to cover any required withholding taxes before actual receipt of those Shares. In lieu of all or any part of a cash payment from a person receiving Shares under the Plan, the Committee may permit the Participant to 
 15 

satisfy all or any part of the required tax withholding obligations (but not to exceed the maximum individual statutory tax rate in each applicable jurisdiction) by authorizing the Company to withhold a number of the Shares that would otherwise be delivered to the Participant pursuant to the Award, or by delivering to the Company Shares already owned by the Participant, with the Shares so withheld or delivered having a Fair Market Value on the date the taxes are required to be withheld equal to the amount of taxes to be withheld. 
 15.	 Effective Date, Duration, Amendment and Termination of the Plan . 
 (a)	 Effective Date . The Plan became effective on the Effective Date, which is the date that it was approved by the Company s shareholders, which shall be considered the date of its adoption for purposes of Treasury Regulation 1.422-2(b)(2)(i). No Awards shall be made under the Plan prior to its Effective Date. 
 (b) Duration of the Plan . The Plan shall remain in effect until all Shares subject to it are distributed, all Awards have expired or terminated, the Plan is terminated pursuant to Section 15(c), or the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Amended and Restated Plan, whichever occurs first (the Termination Date ). Awards made before the Termination Date shall continue to be outstanding in accordance with their terms and the terms of the Plan unless otherwise provided in the applicable Agreements. 
 (c)	 Amendment and Termination of the Plan . The Board may at any time terminate, suspend or amend the Plan. The Company shall submit any amendment of the Plan to its shareholders for approval only to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or the rules of any securities exchange on which the Shares may then be listed. No termination, suspension, or amendment of the Plan may materially impair the rights of any Participant under a previously granted Award without the Participant s consent, unless such action is necessary to comply with applicable law or stock exchange rules. 
 
 (d)	 Amendment of Awards . Subject to Section 15(e), the Committee may unilaterally amend the terms of any Agreement evidencing an Award previously granted, except that no such amendment may materially impair the rights of any Participant under the applicable Award without the Participant s consent, unless such amendment is necessary to comply with applicable law or stock exchange rules or any compensation recovery policy as provided in Section 18(i). 
 
 (e)	 No Option or SAR Repricing .

With respect to any particular Confidential Information that does not constitute a trade secret, the Participant s confidentiality/non-disclosure obligations shall continue as long as such information remains confidential, and shall not apply to information that becomes generally known to the public through no fault or action of the Participant.

 17 

result of the vesting of such Full Value Award; and (iv) if any Options or SARs were exercised within one year of the time of the violation, then the Participant will pay to the Company, upon demand and at the Company s sole discretion, an amount in cash equal to the gain realized by the Participant upon the exercise of such Options or SARs (after taking into account any taxes incurred by the Participant in connection with the exercise of such Options or SARs).

Neither the Company, its Affiliates, the Committee, nor the Board shall be deemed to be a trustee of any amounts to be paid under the Plan nor shall anything contained in the Plan or any action taken pursuant to its provisions create or be construed to create a fiduciary relationship between the Company and/or its Affiliates, and a Participant. To the extent any person has or acquires a right to receive a payment in connection with an Award under the Plan, this right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. 
 (b) Limits of Liability . Except as may be required by law, neither the Company nor any member of the Board or of the Committee, nor any other person participating (including participation pursuant to a delegation of authority under Section 3(c) of the Plan) in any determination of any question under the Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application of the Plan, shall have any liability to any party for any action taken, or not taken, in good faith under the Plan.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the acquisition, holding or disposition of Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan shall in all events be subject to compliance with applicable Company policies as they exist from time to time, including without limitation those relating to insider trading, pledging or hedging transactions, minimum holding periods and stock ownership guidelines, and to forfeiture or recovery of compensation as provided in Section 18(i). 
 (d) Other Benefit and Compensation Programs . Payments and other benefits received by a Participant under an Award made pursuant to the Plan shall not be deemed a part of a Participant s regular, recurring compensation for purposes of the termination, indemnity or severance pay laws of any country and shall not be included in, nor have any effect on, the determination of benefits under any other employee benefit plan, contract or similar arrangement provided by the Company or an Affiliate unless expressly so provided by such other plan, contract or arrangement, or unless the Committee expressly determines that an Award or portion of an Award should be included to accurately reflect competitive compensation 
 18 

practices or to recognize that an Award has been made in lieu of a portion of competitive cash compensation. 
 (e)	 Governing Law . To the extent that federal laws do not otherwise control, the Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant to the Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Indiana without regard to its conflicts-of-law principles and shall be construed accordingly. 
 (f)	 Severability . If any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 
 
 (g)	 Code Section 409A . It is intended that (i) all Awards of Options, SARs and Restricted Stock under the Plan will be exempt from Code Section 409A, and (ii) all other Awards under the Plan will either be exempt from Code Section 409A, or will comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A, and Awards shall be structured and the Plan administered and interpreted in accordance with this intent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or any Agreement, with respect to any Award that constitutes a deferral of compensation subject to Code Section 409A: 
 
 (i)	If any amount is payable under such Award upon a termination of Service, a termination of Service will be deemed to have occurred only at such time as the Participant has experienced a separation from service as such term is defined for purposes of Code Section 409A; 
 
 (ii)	If any amount shall be payable with respect to any such Award as a result of a Participant s separation from service at such time as the Participant is a specified employee within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then no payment shall be made, except as permitted under Code Section 409A, prior to the first business day after the earlier of (A) the date that is six months after the Participant s separation from service or (B) the Participant s death. Unless the Committee has adopted a specified employee identification policy as contemplated by Code Section 409A, specified employees will be identified in accordance with the default provisions specified under Code Section 409A; and 
 
 (iii) 	Each amount to be paid under an Award or this Plan shall be construed as a separate and distinct payment for purposes of Code Section 409A. 
 
 None of the Company, the Board, the Committee nor any other person involved with the administration of this Plan shall (x) in any way be responsible for ensuring the exemption of any Award from, or compliance by any Award with, the requirements of Code Section 409A, (y) have any obligation to design or administer the Plan or Awards granted thereunder in a manner that minimizes a Participant s tax liabilities, including the avoidance of any additional tax liabilities under Code Section 409A, or (z) have any liability to any Participant for any such tax liabilities. 
 
 	(h) Rule 16b-3 . It is intended that the Plan and all Awards granted pursuant to it shall be administered by the Committee so as to permit the Plan and Awards to comply with Exchange Act Rule 16b-3. If any provision of the Plan or of any Award would otherwise frustrate or conflict with the intent expressed in this Section 18(h), that provision to the extent possible shall be interpreted and deemed amended in the manner determined by the Committee so as to avoid the conflict. To the extent of any remaining irreconcilable conflict with this intent, the provision shall be deemed void as applied to Participants subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by law and in the manner deemed advisable by the Committee. 
 
 19 

(i) Forfeiture and Compensation Recovery . 
 
 (i)	The Committee may specify in an Agreement that the Participant s rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recovery by the Company upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events may include termination of Service for Cause; violation of any material Company or Affiliate policy; a determination that the payment of the Award was based on an incorrect determination that financial or other criteria were met or other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company or its Affiliates. 
 
 (ii)	Awards and any compensation associated therewith may be made subject to forfeiture, recovery by the Company or other action pursuant to any compensation recovery policy adopted by the Board or the Committee at any time, including in response to the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and the listing rules and other guidance thereunder, or as otherwise required by law. Any Agreement may be unilaterally amended by the Committee to comply with any such compensation recovery policy.

Section 4. Bonus Provisions.

The applicable Performance Period and Performance Target(s) shall be determined by the Committee consistent with the terms of the Plan. Notwithstanding the fact that the Performance Target(s) have been attained, the Company may pay a Bonus of less than the amount determined by the formula or standard established pursuant to Section 4.2 or may pay no Bonus at all, unless the Committee otherwise expressly provides by written contract or other written commitment. 
 
 4.2 Selection of Performance Target(s). The specific Performance Target(s) with respect to the Business Criteria must be established by the Committee while the performance relating to the Performance Target(s) remains substantially uncertain. At the time the Performance Target(s) are selected, the Committee shall provide, in terms of an objective formula or standard for each Participant, and for any person who may become a Participant after the Performance Target(s) are set, the method of computing the specific amount that will represent the maximum amount of Bonus payable to the Participant if the Performance Target(s) are attained, subject to Sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.7 and 5.1. 
 
 4.3 Maximum Individual Bonus. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no Executive shall receive a Bonus under the Plan for any Year in excess of 300 of his or her Base Salary for the Year. 
 
 4.4 Selection of Participants. For each Performance Period, the Committee shall determine, at the time the Business Criteria and the Performance Target(s) are set, those Executives who will participate in the Plan. 
 
 4.5 Effect of Mid-Year Commencement of Service . To the extent compatible with Section 4.2, if an Executive commences employment with the Company after the adoption of the Plan and the Performance Target(s) are established for a Performance Period, the Committee may grant to that Executive a Bonus for that Performance Period that is proportionately adjusted based on the period of actual service during such Performance Period. 
 
 4.6 Accounting Changes. If, after the Performance Target(s) are established for a Performance Period, a change occurs in the applicable accounting principles or practices, the amount of the Bonuses paid under this Plan for such Performance Period shall be determined without regard to such change. 
 
 4.7 Committee Discretion to Determine Bonuses. The Committee has the sole discretion to determine the standard or formula pursuant to which each Participant s Bonus shall be calculated (in accordance with Section 4.2), whether all or any portion of the amount so calculated will be paid, and the specific amount (if any) to be paid to each Participant, subject in all cases to the terms, conditions and limits of the Plan and of any other written commitment authorized by the Committee. In addition to the establishment of Performance Targets as provided in Section 4.2, the Committee may at any time establish additional conditions and terms of payment of Bonuses (including but not limited to the achievement of other financial, strategic or individual goals, which may be objective or subjective) as it may deem desirable in carrying out the purposes of the Plan and may take into account such other factors as it deems appropriate in administering any aspect of the Plan. The Committee may not, however, increase the maximum amount permitted to be paid to any individual under Section 4.2 or 4.3 of the Plan or award a Bonus under this Plan if the applicable Performance Target(s) have not been satisfied. 
 
 4.8 Committee Certification. No Participant shall receive any payment under the Plan unless the Committee has certified, by resolution or other appropriate action in writing, that the amount thereof has been accurately determined in accordance with the terms, conditions and limits of the Plan and that the Performance Target(s) and any other material terms previously established by the Committee or set forth in the Plan were in fact satisfied. 
 
 4 

4.9 Time of Payment. Any Bonuses granted by the Committee under the Plan shall be paid in a single annual payment as soon as practicable following the latest of (a) the end of the applicable Year, (b) the Committee s determinations under this Section 4 and (c) the certification of the Committee s findings under Section 4.8, but in no event later than two and one half months following the last day of such Year (the Payment Date ). Any such payment shall be in cash or cash equivalent, subject to applicable withholding requirements. 
 
 4.10 Employment on Payment Date . To be entitled to a Bonus payment under this Plan for an applicable Year or any Performance Period within such Year, the Executive must remain employed by the Company through the Payment Date for such Year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, however, if the Executive leaves employment with the Company prior to the Payment Date for such Year due to voluntary retirement on or after age 60, disability or death, the Executive shall remain eligible for a Bonus payment for any Performance Period for such Year that had been completed prior to the Executive leaving employment, to the extent the Committee determines that the Executive is otherwise entitled to a Bonus for such Performance Period under this Section 4. Such Bonus payment, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.9. 
 
 Section 5. General Provisions 
 
 5.1 No Right to Bonus or Continued Employment. Neither the establishment of the Plan nor the provision for or payment of any amounts hereunder nor any action of the Company (including, for purposes of this Section 5.1, any predecessor or subsidiary), the Board of Directors of the Company or the Committee in respect of the Plan, shall be held or construed to confer upon any person any legal right to receive, or any interest in, a Bonus or any other benefit under the Plan, or any legal right to be continued in the employ of the Company unless otherwise provided by the Committee by contract or agreement. The Company expressly reserves any and all rights to discharge an Executive in its sole discretion, without liability of any person, entity or governing body under the Plan or otherwise. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof and notwithstanding the fact that the Performance Target(s) have been attained and/or the individual maximum amounts pursuant to Section 4.2 have been calculated, the Company shall have no obligation to pay any Bonus hereunder nor to pay the maximum amount so calculated, unless the Committee otherwise expressly provides by written contract or other written commitment. 
 
 5.2 Discretion of Company, Board of Directors and Committee. Any decision made or action taken by the Company or by the Board of Directors of the Company or by the Committee arising out of or in connection with the creation, amendment, construction, administration, interpretation and effect of the Plan shall be within the absolute discretion of such entity and shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons. No member of the Committee shall have any personal liability for actions taken or omitted under the Plan by the member or any other person. 
 
 5.3 Absence of Liability . A member of the Board of Directors of the Company or a member of the Committee of the Company or any officer of the Company shall not be personally liable for any act or inaction hereunder, whether of commission or omission. 
 
 5.4 No Funding of Plan. The Company shall not be required to fund or otherwise segregate any cash or any other assets which may at any time be paid to Participants under the Plan. The Plan shall constitute an unfunded plan of the Company. The Company shall not, by any provisions of the Plan, be deemed to be a trustee of any property, and any obligations of the Company to any Participant under the Plan shall be those of a debtor and any rights of any Participant or former Participant shall be limited to those of a general unsecured creditor. 
 
 5.5 Non-Transferability of Benefits and Interests. Except as expressly provided by the Committee, no benefit payable under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any such attempted action shall be void and no such benefit shall be in any manner liable for or subject to debts, contracts, liabilities, 
 5 

engagements or torts of any Participant or former Participant. This Section 5.5 shall not apply to an assignment of a contingency or payment due after the death of the Executive to the deceased Executive s legal representative or beneficiary. 
 
 5.6 Law to Govern. All questions pertaining to the construction, regulation, validity and effect of the provisions of the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Indiana. 
 
 5.7 Non-Exclusivity. The Plan does not limit the authority of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or the Committee, or any subsidiary of the Company, to grant awards or authorize any other compensation under any other plan or authority, including, without limitation, awards or other compensation based on the same Performance Target(s) used under the Plan. 
 
 5.8 [Reserved] . 
 
 5.9 Section 409A Compliance . It is the intent of the Company that any Bonus payable under this Plan be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A to the maximum extent possible, including pursuant to the short-term deferral exception described in Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(4). However, to the extent Section 409A is applicable to a Bonus paid under this Plan, the Company intends that the payment of such Bonus comply with any applicable limitations, restrictions and requirements of Section 409A.

 Amended by the Board of Directors as of November 1, 2024
