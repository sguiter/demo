 Purchase Price Allocation 
 The Diamond Transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, with Noble being treated as the accounting acquirer.

 Determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities of Diamond and the consideration paid required judgment and certain assumptions to be made. The most significant fair value estimates related to the valuation of Diamond s mobile offshore drilling units and other related tangible assets, the fair value of drilling contracts, and debt. 
 Offshore drilling units. The valuation of Diamond s mobile offshore drilling units was determined using the discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the drilling assets over their remaining useful lives.

 In deriving the above net deferred tax benefits, the Company relied on sources of income attributable to the projected taxable income for the period covered by the Company s relevant existing drilling contracts based on the assumption that the relevant rigs will be owned by the relevant rig owners during the relevant existing drilling contract periods. Given the mobile nature of the Company s assets, we are not able to reasonably forecast the jurisdictions in which taxable income from future drilling contracts may arise. We also have limited objective positive evidence in historical periods. Accordingly, in determining the amount of additional deferred tax assets to recognize, we did not consider projected book income beyond the conclusion of existing drilling contracts. As new drilling contracts are executed or as current contracts are extended, we will reassess the amount of deferred tax assets that are realizable. Finally, once we have established sufficient objective positive evidence for historical periods, we may consider reliance on forecasted taxable income from future drilling contracts. 
 At September 30, 2024, the reserves for uncertain tax positions totaled million (net of related tax benefits of million ). At December 31, 2023, the reserves for uncertain tax positions totaled million (net of related tax benefits of million).

 Services Agreement 
 In February 2016, Diamond entered into a agreement with a subsidiary of Baker Hughes Company (formerly named Baker Hughes, a GE company) to provide services with respect to certain blowout preventer and related well control equipment on our drillships. Such services include management of maintenance, certification, and reliability with respect to such equipment. Future commitments under the contractual services agreements are estimated to be approximately million annually. Total future commitments are projected to be million in the aggregate over the remaining term of the agreement, including a million commitment for the purchase of consumables and capital spare parts owned and controlled by the vendor at the end of the service arrangement. 
 Letters of Credit and Surety bonds 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had million of letters of credit issued under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility and an additional million in letters of credit and surety bonds issued under bilateral arrangements which guarantee our performance as it relates to our drilling contracts, contract bidding, tax appeals, customs duties, and other obligations in various jurisdictions. We expect to comply with the underlying performance requirements and we expect obligations under these letters of credit and surety bonds will not be called.

Executive Overview 
 Noble is a leading offshore drilling contractor for the oil and gas industry. As of the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Noble performs, through its subsidiaries, contract drilling services with a fleet of 41 drilling rigs, consisting of 28 floaters and 13 jackups focused largely on ultra-deepwater and high-specification jackup drilling opportunities in both established and emerging regions worldwide. Following the recent Diamond Transaction, our total floater count now also includes several lower specification semisubmersibles. We typically employ each drilling unit under an individual contract, and many contracts are awarded based upon a competitive bidding process. 
 We report our contract drilling operations as a single reportable segment, Contract Drilling Services, which reflects how we manage our business. The mobile offshore drilling units comprising our offshore rig fleet operate in a global market for contract drilling services and are often redeployed to different regions due to changing demands of our customers, which consist primarily of large, integrated, independent and government-owned or controlled oil and gas companies throughout the world. 
 Recent Events 
 Diamond Transaction. On June 9, 2024, Noble entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Diamond Merger Agreement with Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. Diamond ), Dolphin Merger Sub 1, Inc., and Dolphin Merger Sub 2, Inc., under which Noble would acquire Diamond in a stock plus cash transaction (the Diamond Transaction ). On September 4, 2024 the Diamond Closing Date ), Noble completed its acquisition of Diamond. Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Diamond Merger Agreement, Diamond shareholders received 0.2316 shares of Noble, plus cash consideration of 5.65 per share for each share of Diamond. 
 8.000 Senior Notes due 2030. In August 2024, Noble Finance II issued an additional 800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 8.000 Senior Notes due 2030 at a premium of 103 bringing the total outstanding principal amount to 1.4 billion (collectively, the 2030 Notes ). The 2030 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 18, 2023, among Noble Finance II, certain subsidiaries of Noble Finance II (the Guarantors ), and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. 
 
 Market Outlook 
 In recent years, oil prices have generally remained at levels that are supportive of offshore exploration and development activity and global rig demand is increasing. This increasing demand has been caused by the combination of growing confidence in commodity prices, heightened focus on energy security, recent multi-year underinvestment in the development and exploration of hydrocarbons, and relative attractiveness of offshore plays with respect to both cost and carbon emissions. This increase had a positive impact on dayrates for certain of our rig classes. 
 The global rig supply has come down from historic highs as Noble and other offshore drilling contractors have retired less capable and idle assets. Concurrently, the incoming supply of newbuild offshore drilling rigs has diminished materially, with several newbuild rigs stranded in shipyards. However, we expect many of these stranded newbuild rigs may continue to make their way into the global market over the next few years. 
 Although the market outlook in our business varies by geographical region and water depth, we remain encouraged by the long-term outlook in the ultra-deepwater floater market, with overall demand having increased from 2020 lows. However, within this ultra-deepwater market, our customers continue to focus on our highest specification floaters, which represents the majority of our floater fleet. Assuming current market fundamentals, continued customer prioritization towards these highest specification floaters is likely to result in lower utilization for our lower specification drillships and our semi-submersibles. Demand for midwater semisubmersibles is primarily driven by brownfield activity in mature basins, especially in Northwest Europe and the Asia Pacific regions, where a generally stable level of baseload demand is supported by infield drilling and plug and abandonment requirements. We have also observed an overall demand increase in the global jackup market since 2020, with the Middle East being the largest component of this increase. While we remain encouraged about overall rig demand, to the extent global macroeconomic concerns become more prevalent and produce downward pressure on oil and gas prices, we could experience downward pressure on overall rig demand for both floaters and jackups. 
 As of the date of this report, the majority of our jackup fleet is positioned in the North Sea. While we are starting to see some increased tender activity in the UK North Sea, overall activity levels in this region remain subdued compared to historical levels. The Norway ultra-harsh environment jackup market is similar, where current activity also remains below 
 27 

historical levels, despite the market being attractive to operators given it is characterized by low-cost and low-emission barrels. 
 Returning to the broader offshore drilling market, while the length of contract terms has started to moderately increase, the overall market remains characterized by generally shorter-term contracts. This leads to an increased number of rig contract start-ups, both with different customers and among different regions. These rig contract start-ups and other shipyard projects may result in incremental resources and costs and, in certain cases, may delay delivery of the applicable rig which may trigger applicable late delivery clauses. A combination of customers delaying certain drilling programs and shorter-term contracts, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, lower overall utilization for our fleet. 
 The energy transition from hydrocarbons to renewables poses a challenge to the oil and gas sector and our market. Energy rebalancing trends have accelerated in recent years as evidenced by promulgated or proposed government policies and commitments by many of our customers to further invest in sustainable energy sources. Our industry could be further challenged as our customers rebalance their capital investments more towards alternative energy sources. However, at the same time, there continues to be a global dependence on the combustion of hydrocarbons to provide reliable and affordable energy. Low-cost and low-emission barrels are expected to be the most attractive conventional source to meet energy needs, both currently and in the future. Global energy demand is predicted to increase over the coming decades, and we expect that offshore oil and gas will continue to play an important and lasting role in meeting this demand. 
 We expect inflationary pressures to persist, which has led or may lead to increased costs of services. Additionally, we expect supply chain disruptions to continue, and potentially accelerate, as geopolitical crises, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Middle East conflicts, the Guyana-Venezuela dispute, and their respective regional and global ramifications, have the potential to negatively impact our ability to conduct our day-to-day operations. 
 
 Contract Drilling Services Backlog 
 We maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling services. Our contract drilling services backlog reflects estimated future revenues attributable to signed drilling contracts. While backlog did not include any letters of intent as of September 30, 2024, in the past we have included in backlog certain letters of intent that we expect to result in binding drilling contracts. As of September 30, 2024, contract drilling services backlog totaled approximately 6.5 billion, which includes a commitment of approximately 70 of available days for the remainder of 2024. 
 We calculate backlog for any given unit and period by multiplying the full contractual operating dayrate for such unit by the number of days remaining in the period, and include certain assumptions based on the terms of certain contractual arrangements, discussed in the notes to the table below. The reported contract drilling services backlog does not include amounts representing revenues for mobilization, demobilization, and contract preparation, which are not expected to be significant to our contract drilling services revenues, amounts constituting reimbursables from customers, or amounts attributable to uncommitted option periods under drilling contracts or letters of intent. 
 The table below presents the amount of our contract drilling services backlog as of September 30, 2024, and the percent of available operating days committed for the periods indicated:

(2) Noble entered into a multi-year Commercial Enabling Agreement (the CEA with ExxonMobil in February 2020. Under the CEA, dayrates for the rigs are repriced on March 1 and September 1 each year to the projected market rate at the time the new rate goes into effect, subject to a scale-based discount and a performance bonus that appropriately aligns the interests of Noble and ExxonMobil. Under the CEA, the table above includes awarded and remaining current contract term to August 18, 2028, related to each of the four following rigs: the Noble Tom Madden, Noble Bob Douglas, Noble Don Taylor , and Noble Sam Croft . Under the CEA, ExxonMobil may reassign remaining contract term among rigs, subject to maintaining certain minimum contract term on the rig from which term is removed. 
 (3) In 2022, Noble renewed its five-year Framework Agreement with Aker BP (the Framework Agreement for the provision of ultra-harsh environment jackup rigs, the Noble Integrator and Noble Invincible , for activities offshore Norway. Under the Framework Agreement, different rate structures apply reflecting different operating modes, agreed incentive schemes, and adjustments for operating expenses. Rate structures are adjusted annually to reflect market conditions. 
 (4) Percent of available days committed is calculated by dividing the total number of days our rigs are operating under contract for such period by the product of the number of our rigs, including cold-stacked rigs, and the number of calendar days in such period. 
 The amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned may be materially different than the backlog amounts and backlog periods presented in the table above due to various factors, including, but not limited to, shipyard and maintenance projects, unplanned downtime, the operation of market benchmarks for dayrate resets, achievement of bonuses, weather conditions, reduced standby or mobilization rates, and other factors that result in applicable dayrates lower than the full contractual operating dayrate. In addition, amounts included in the backlog may change because drilling contracts may be varied or modified according to their terms or by mutual consent, or customers may exercise early termination rights contained in some of our drilling contracts or decline to enter into a drilling contract after executing a letter of intent. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for the periods for which the backlog is calculated. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Operations Our current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be ultimately realized in our Form 10-K. 
 As of September 30, 2024, ExxonMobil, Petrobras, and BP represented approximately 38.0 , 13.5 , and 13.3 of our backlog, respectively.

Results of Operations 
 
 Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (the current quarter ), was 61.2 million, or 0.40 per diluted share, on operating revenues of 800.5 million compared to net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023, of 158.3 million, or 1.09 per diluted share, on operating revenues of 697.5 million. 
 Key Operating Metrics 
 Operating results for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics: operating days, dayrates, and operating costs. We also track rig utilization, which is a function of operating days and the number of rigs in our fleet. For more information on operating costs, see Contract Drilling Services below. 
 The following table presents the average rig utilization, operating days, and average dayrates for our rig fleet for the periods indicated:

 (1) We define utilization for a specific period as the total number of days our rigs are operating under contract divided by the product of the total number of our rigs, including cold stacked rigs, and the number of calendar days in such period. Information reflects our policy of reporting on the basis of the number of available rigs in our fleet. 
 (2) An operating day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig operated under a drilling contract. We define average dayrates as revenue from contract drilling services earned per operating day. Average dayrates exclude the effect of non-cash amortization related to favorable and unfavorable off-market customer contract assets and liabilities.

 Contract Drilling Services Revenues 

Floaters. During the third quarter of 2024, floaters generated revenue of 605.3 million, as compared to 549.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenue was mainly attributable to 84.0 million provided by the 10 additional floaters acquired in connection with the Diamond Transaction as well as 56.8 million from an increase in average dayrates in the current period. These increases were partly offset by 83.4 million from rigs with net changes in operating days in the current period. 
 Jackups. During the third quarter of 2024, jackups generated revenue of 158.2 million, as compared to 121.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenue was mainly attributable to 24.8 million from an increase in average 
 31 

dayrates in the current period and 20.3 million from rigs with net changes in operating days in the current period. Additionally, jackup revenue from net non-cash amortization related to off-market customer contract assets and liabilities decreased 5.7 million in the current period. 
 Operating Costs and Expenses 
 Floaters. During the third quarter of 2024, total contract drilling services costs related to floaters was 332.6 million, as compared to 266.9 million in the third quarter 2023. The primary drivers of this increase were 44.0 million related to the 10 additional floaters acquired in connection with the Diamond Transaction, 7.6 million in repairs and maintenance, 4.0 million in transportation and storage, and 19.3 million in non-labor crew costs and operations support costs across the fleet. These increases were partially offset by decreases of 3.3 million in labor, and 6.0 million in mobilization. 
 Jackups. During the third quarter of 2024, total contract drilling services cost related to jackups was 101.6 million, as compared to 87.3 million in the third quarter 2023. The primary drivers of the aggregate increase of 29.6 million related to labor costs, repairs and maintenance, mobilization, operations support, and other costs across the fleet. These increases were partially offset by decreases in fuel and other costs across the fleet. Further, there was a decrease of 15.3 million after the completion of disposal activities regarding certain rigs. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization totaled 109.9 million and 77.1 million during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Depreciation and amortization increased by 32.7 million in the current quarter primarily due to the timing of capital additions that were placed in service as compared to retirements among the periods and the Diamond Transaction. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses totaled 43.6 million and 33.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily a result of the Diamond Transaction and other individually insignificant items within certain corporate charges such as professional fees, corporate leases, and employee related costs. 
 Merger and integration costs. Noble incurred 69.2 million and 13.0 million of merger and integration costs during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the third quarter of 2024, 63.1 million and 6.1 million of costs related directly to the Diamond Transaction and the Business Combination with Maersk Drilling, respectively. Costs incurred prior to the third quarter of 2024 related to the Business Combination with Maersk Drilling in October 2022. A majority of the costs in the third quarter of 2024 attributable to the Diamond Transaction related to the closing of the transaction and included charges for professional fees, severance, and share-based compensation. 
 Hurricane losses and (recoveries), net. During the third quarter of 2024, costs incurred in connection with the Hurricane Ida incident were offset by accrued recoveries. For additional information about the Hurricane Ida incident, see Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Other Income and Expenses 
 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled 25.0 million and 13.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense primarily relates to our 8.000 Senior Notes issued in August 2024 and April 2023 as well as 8.500 Senior Secured Second Lien Notes assumed in connection with the Diamond Transaction. For additional information, see Note 6 Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Gain on bargain purchase. Noble recognized a 5.0 million gain on the bargain purchase of Maersk Drilling during the third quarter of 2023. For additional information, see Note 2 Acquisitions to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Interest income and other, net. Noble recognized other income of 2.3 million and 17.2 million during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The third quarter of 2023 included approximately 18.0 million of compensation related to a joint taxation scheme with A.P. M ller Holding A/S. 
 Income tax benefit (provision). Noble recorded an income tax provision of 31.6 million and 51.7 million during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, our tax provision included tax benefits of 36.2 million related to releases of valuation allowance for deferred tax benefits primarily in Luxembourg. Such tax benefits are offset by tax expenses related to recurring quarterly accruals of 67.8 million mostly in Guyana, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Nigeria. 
 32 

During the third quarter of 2023, our tax provision included tax benefits of 17.2 million related to releases and adjustments of valuation allowance for deferred tax benefits in Guyana, Norway, Switzerland, and Luxembourg and a tax benefit of 2.0 million related to a foreign tax credit refund. Such tax benefits are offset by tax expenses related to contract fair value amortization of 7.4 million and various recurring quarterly accruals of 63.5 million primarily in Guyana, Australia, Denmark, and Luxembourg. 
 
 Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 351.7 million, or 2.37 per diluted share, on operating revenues of 2.1 billion compared to compared to net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of 332.2 million, or 2.29 per diluted share, on operating revenues of 1.9 billion. 
 Key Operating Metrics 
 Operating results for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics: operating days, dayrates, and operating costs. We also track rig utilization, which is a function of operating days and the number of rigs in our fleet. For more information on operating costs, see Contract Drilling Services below. 
 The following table presents the average rig utilization, operating days and average dayrates for our rig fleet for the periods indicated:

 (1) We define utilization for a specific period as the total number of days our rigs are operating under contract divided by the product of the total number of our rigs, including cold stacked rigs, and the number of calendar days in such period. Information reflects our policy of reporting on the basis of the number of available rigs in our fleet. 
 (2) An operating day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig operated under a drilling contract. We define average dayrates as revenue from contract drilling services earned per operating day. Average dayrates exclude the effect of non-cash amortization related to favorable and unfavorable off-market customer contract assets and liabilities.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement 
 On April 18, 2023, Noble entered into the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility under the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement provides for commitments of 550 million with maturity in 2028. The guarantors under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility are the same subsidiaries of Noble Finance II that are or will be guarantors of the 2030 Notes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding and 24.0 million of letters of credit issued under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility. For additional information about our 2023 Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, see Note 6 Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 8.000 Senior Notes due 2030 
 In August 2024, Noble Finance II issued an additional 800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 8.000 Senior Notes due 2030 at a premium of 103 bringing the total outstanding principal amount to 1.4 billion. The 2030 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated April 18, 2023, among Noble Finance II, the Guarantors, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. For additional information about the 2030 Senior Notes, see Note 6 Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Diamond Second Lien Notes due 2030 
 In connection with the Diamond Transaction, the Company assumed 550 million aggregate principal amount of 8.500 Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due October 2030 issued by Diamond Foreign Asset Company and Diamond Finance, LLC. For additional information about the Diamond Second Lien Notes, see Note 6 Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Diamond Credit Facility 
 In connection with the Diamond Transaction, the Company terminated Diamond s 300 million senior secured revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in April 2026. At the time of the merger and termination, Diamond had no outstanding borrowings under the facility. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Our principal sources of capital in the current period were cash generated from operating activities as well as net proceeds from the issuance of additional 2030 Notes. Cash on hand during the current period was primarily used for the following: 
 cash consideration and fees related to the Diamond Transaction; 
 normal recurring operating expenses; 
 planned and discretionary capital expenditures; 
 fees and expenses related to merger and integration costs; 
 share repurchases and dividend payments; and 
 certain contractual cash obligations and commitments. 
 Our anticipated cash flow needs, both in the short term and long term, may also include repurchases, redemptions, or repayments of debt and interest. 
 36 

We currently expect to fund our cash flow needs with cash generated by our operations, cash on hand, proceeds from sales of assets, or borrowings under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility and we believe this will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our cash flow needs over the next 12 months. Subject to market conditions and other factors, we may also issue equity or long-term debt securities to fund our cash flow needs and for other purposes. In 2023 and during the first three quarters of 2024, we incurred additional expenses and capital costs related to the damage and repair of two jackup rigs. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, we incurred additional expenses and capital costs related to the damage and repair of one floater. These incurred costs exceeded our deductible amount. As such, we have received partial insurance recoveries and we continue to seek insurance recoveries for the remainder of the incurred and anticipated costs. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 519.3 million and 286.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to improvements in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities, with key drivers being an increase in payments from customers offset by a reduction in payments to vendors. We had working capital of 510.2 million at September 30, 2024, and 420.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 813.8 million and 268.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and primarily consisted of capital expenditures on routine projects associated with overhauls and upgrades on various rigs and net cash paid related to the closing of the Diamond Transaction. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 331.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and net cash used in financing activities was 254.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024, included the issuance of an additional 824.0 million of 2030 Notes. We also repurchased 6.9 million of our Ordinary Shares for total of 250.0 million, made dividend payments to our shareholders of 198.2 million, and paid 57.2 million in taxes withheld on vested employee share-based compensation awards. The nine months ended September 30, 2023, included the repayment of the DSF Credit Facility in full, redemption of Noble Second Lien Notes, repayment of the New DNB Credit Facility, totaling 673.4 million, and the 600.0 million issuance of 2030 Notes. We also repurchased 2.0 million of our Ordinary Shares for total of 80.0 million and made dividend payments to our shareholders of 42.4 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had a total contract drilling services backlog of approximately 6.5 billion, which includes a commitment of 70 of available days for the remainder of 2024. For additional information regarding our backlog, see Contract Drilling Services Backlog. 
 Capital Additions 
 Capital additions totaled 374.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted of the following: 
 214.2 million for sustaining capital; 
 132.8 million in major projects, including subsea and other related projects; and 
 27.3 million for rebillable capital and contract modifications. 
 Our total capital additions estimate for the year ending December 31, 2024, net of reimbursements, is expected to range between 480 million and 510 million, of which approximately 300 million to 330 million is currently anticipated to be spent for sustaining capital. We expect to fund these capital additions with cash generated by our operations and cash on hand. 
 From time to time we consider possible projects and may have certain events, such as insured losses, that would require expenditures that are not included in our capital budget, and such unbudgeted expenditures could be significant. In addition, while liquidity and preservation of capital remains our top priority, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of drilling units from time to time. 
 Dividends 
 Our most recent quarterly dividend, totaling approximately 81.6 million (or 0.50 per share), was declared on June 10, 2024, and paid on September 26, 2024, to shareholders of record at close of business on September 12, 2024. 
 On November 5, 2024, Noble s Board of Directors declared an interim quarterly cash dividend on our Ordinary Shares of 0.50 per share. The 0.50 dividend is expected to be paid on December 19, 2024, to shareholders of record at close of business on December 5, 2024. 
 The declaration and payment of dividends require authorization of the Board of Directors, provided that such dividends on issued share capital may be paid only out of the Company s distributable reserves as determined by reference to relevant 
 37 

statutory accounts in accordance with English law. The Company is not permitted to pay dividends out of share capital, which includes share premiums. The payment of future dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future business prospects, the availability of sufficient distributable reserves, contractual and indenture restrictions, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. 
 Share Repurchases 
 On October 22, 2024 the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to 400 million commencing immediately after completion of the prior 400 million share repurchase. All shares purchased under the share repurchase programs are cancelled. The share repurchase programs take place within the limitations of the general authority previously granted by shareholders, or any authorization to be granted at a future general meeting of the Company. As of the date hereof, the repurchase programs do not have fixed expirations, and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of shares.

 There has been no significant change in our exposure to market risk when compared to those disclosed in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Robert W. Eifler, President and Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) of Noble, and Richard B. Barker, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) of Noble, have evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. On the basis of this evaluation and, as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described below, Mr. Eifler and Mr. Barker have concluded that Noble s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Previously Reported Material Weakness 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 As disclosed in our Form 10-K, we previously identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as the Company did not design and maintain effective controls over certain information technology general controls for an information system that is relevant to the preparation of Noble s consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain (i) program change management controls to ensure that program and data changes are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately and (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user and privileged access to appropriate personnel. 
 The material weakness described above did not result in a misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. However, the material weakness could result in a misstatement of our financial statement accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 Remediation Plan 
 Noble is committed to the planning and implementation of remediation efforts to address the material weakness described above. As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, we completed the design and implementation of controls related to (i) program change management controls to ensure that program and data changes are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately and (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user and privileged access to appropriate personnel. While we have completed the design and implementation of these controls, certain controls have not operated effectively for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate the material weakness has been remediated. Therefore, the remediation plan includes the continued operation of the newly designed and implemented controls. 
 Noble is working to remediate the material weakness by executing the measures outlined above, and we believe the measures described above will remediate the material weakness and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that the controls are operating effectively. 
 The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review as well as Audit Committee oversight. As we continue to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the area affected by the material weakness, we will perform additional procedures, including the use of manual mitigating control procedures where necessary, and plan to employ any additional resources deemed necessary to provide assurance that our financial statements continue to be fairly stated in all material respects. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may execute additional measures to address potential control deficiencies or modify the remediation plan described above. Management will continue reviewing and making necessary changes to our internal controls' overall design.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Other than as described above, there were no changes in Noble s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting of Noble. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring (including internal auditing practices), and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, however well designed, including the possibility of human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls. The design of an internal control system is also based in part upon assumptions and judgments made by management about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that an internal control will be effective under all potential future conditions. As a result, even an effective system of internal controls can provide no more than reasonable assurance with respect to the fair presentation of financial statements and the processes under which they were prepared.

Upon payment in cash of the benefit provided by any Award granted under this Plan, any Shares that were covered by that Award will again be available for Awards under the Plan.

 (iii) Awards may, in the discretion of the Committee, be made under the Plan in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines Substitute Awards ). The number of Shares underlying any Substitute Awards shall not be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan. 
 (iv) In the event that an entity acquired by the Company or with which it combines has shares available under a pre-existing plan Target Company Plan previously approved by stockholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition, merger or other combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, to reflect such acquisition or merger) Assumed Available Shares may be used for Awards under this Plan made after such acquisition or merger provided, however, that Awards using such Assumed Available Shares may not be made after the deadline for new awards or grants under the terms of the Target Company Plan, and may only be made to individuals who were not employees or directors of the Company or any subsidiary prior to such acquisition, merger or other combination. The Awards so granted may reflect the original terms of the awards being assumed or substituted or converted for and need not comply with other specific terms of this Plan if such Awards comply with the terms of the Target Company Plan, and may account for Shares substituted for the securities covered by the original awards and the number of shares subject to the original awards, as well as any exercise or purchase prices applicable to the original awards, adjusted to account for differences in stock prices in connection with the transaction. 
 (b) Adjustments . Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that the Committee determines that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company, or other corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that an adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall equitably adjust any or all of (i) the number of Shares or other securities of the Company (or number and kind of other securities or property) with respect to which Awards may be granted, including any appropriate adjustments to the individual limitations applicable to Awards set forth in Section 4(a)(i) provided , however, that any adjustment to such individual limitations will be made only if and to the extent that such adjustment would not cause any Option intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option to fail to so qualify, (ii) the number of Shares or other securities of the Company (or number and kind of other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards, and (iii) the grant or exercise price with respect to any Award or, if deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding Award in consideration for the cancellation of such Award, which, in the case of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall equal the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Share subject to each such Option or Stock Appreciation Right over the per Share exercise price or grant price of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right. 
 (c) Sources of Shares Deliverable Under Awards . Any Shares delivered pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued Shares or of treasury Shares. 
 Section 5. Eligibility . Any employee of, or consultant to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any prospective employee), or non-employee director who is a member of the Board or the board of directors of a Subsidiary of the Company, shall be eligible to be selected as a Participant and receive any Award as determined by the Committee.

Section 6. Stock Options . 
 (a) Grant . Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole authority to determine the Participants to whom Options shall be granted, the number of Shares to be covered by each Option, the exercise price thereof and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of the Option. The Committee shall have the authority to grant Incentive Stock Options, or to grant Non-Qualified Stock Options, or to grant both types of Options. In the case of Incentive Stock Options, the terms and conditions of such grants shall be subject to and comply with such rules as may be prescribed by Section 422 of the Code, as from time to time amended, and any regulations implementing such statute. All Options when granted under the Plan are intended to be Non-Qualified Stock Options, unless the applicable Award Agreement expressly states that the Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option. If an Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option, and if for any reason such Option (or any portion thereof) shall not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, then, to the extent of such nonqualification, such Option (or portion thereof) shall be regarded as a Non-Qualified Stock Option appropriately granted under the Plan provided that such Option (or portion thereof) otherwise complies with the Plan s requirements relating to Non-Qualified Stock Options. No Option shall be exercisable more than ten years from the date of grant. 
 (b) Exercise Price . The Committee shall establish the exercise price at the time each Option is granted, which exercise price shall be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement and which exercise price (except with respect to Substitute Awards) shall not be less than the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. 
 (c) Exercise . Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, specify in the applicable Award Agreement. The applicable Award Agreement shall specify the period or periods of Continuous Service by the Participant that is necessary before the Option or installments thereof will become exercisable. The Committee may impose such conditions with respect to the exercise of Options, including without limitation, any relating to the application of federal or state securities laws, as it may deem necessary or advisable. 
 (d) Payment . (i) No Shares shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option until payment in full of the aggregate exercise price therefor is received by the Company. Such payment may be made (A) in cash, or its equivalent, or (B) subject to the Company s consent, by exchanging Shares owned by the optionee (which are not the subject of any pledge or other security interest and which have been owned by such optionee for at least six months), or (C) subject to such rules as may be established by the Committee and applicable law, through delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell the Shares otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of the Option and to deliver promptly to the Company an amount equal to the aggregate exercise price, or (D) subject to any conditions or limitations established by the Committee, the Company s withholding of Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of an Option pursuant to a net exercise arrangement (it being understood that, solely for purposes of determining the number of treasury shares held by the Company, the Shares so withheld will not be treated as issued and acquired by the Company upon such exercise), or (E) by a combination of the foregoing, or (F) by such other methods as may be approved by the Committee, provided that the combined value of all cash and cash equivalents and the Fair Market Value of any such Shares so tendered to the Company or withheld as of the date of such tender or withholding is at least equal to such aggregate exercise price. 
 (ii) Wherever in this Plan or any Award Agreement a Participant is permitted to pay the exercise price of an Option or taxes relating to the exercise of an Option by delivering Shares, the Participant may, subject to procedures satisfactory to the Committee, satisfy such delivery requirement by presenting proof of beneficial ownership of such Shares, in which case the Company shall treat the Option as exercised without further payment and shall withhold such number of Shares from the Shares acquired by the exercise of the Option.

 7 

freestanding and unrelated to another Award. Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with or in addition to an Award may be granted either before, at the same time as the Award or at a later time. No Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable more than ten years from the date of grant. 
 (b) Exercise and Payment . A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the Participant to receive an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right over the grant price thereof (which grant price (except with respect to Substitute Awards) shall not be less than the Fair Market Value on the date of grant). The Committee shall determine in its sole discretion whether a Stock Appreciation Right shall be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares. 
 (c) Other Terms and Conditions . Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the Committee shall determine, at the grant of a Stock Appreciation Right, the term, methods of exercise, methods and form of settlement, and any other terms and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right. The Committee may impose such conditions or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it shall deem appropriate.

Upon the lapse of the restrictions applicable to such Shares of Restricted Stock, the Company shall, as applicable, either deliver such certificates to the Participant or the Participant s legal representative or the transfer agent shall remove the restrictions relating to the transfer of such Shares. 
 (c) Payment . Each Restricted Stock Unit shall have a value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share. Restricted Stock Units shall be paid in cash, Shares, other securities or other property, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, upon or after the lapse of the restrictions applicable thereto, or otherwise in accordance with the applicable Award Agreement. No dividends shall be paid on any Shares of Restricted Stock and no dividend equivalents shall be paid on any Restricted Stock Units prior to the vesting of the Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, as applicable.

Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of any such Other Stock-Based Award, including the price, if any, at which securities may be purchased pursuant to any Other Stock-Based Award granted under this Plan. 
 Section 11. Amendment and Termination . 
 (a) Amendments to the Plan . The Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time provided that if an amendment to the Plan (i) would materially increase the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan, (ii) would materially increase the number of securities which may be issued under the Plan, (iii) would materially modify the requirements for participation in the Plan, (iv) would increase the Non-Employee Director Compensation Limit, or (v) must otherwise be approved by the stockholders of the Company in order to comply with applicable law or the rules of the applicable nationally recognized exchange, or, if the Shares are not traded on the applicable nationally recognized exchange, the principal national securities exchange upon which the Shares are traded or quoted, such amendment will be subject to stockholder approval and will not be effective unless and until such approval has been obtained and provided , further, that any such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance or termination that would impair the rights of any Participant or any holder or beneficiary of any Award previously granted shall not be effective as to such Participant without the written consent of the affected Participant, holder or beneficiary.

Section 12. Change in Control . In the event of a Change in Control, and except as otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award Agreement, a Participant s Awards will be treated as follows 
 (a) If an Award is continued, assumed, replaced, converted or has new rights substituted therefor by the resulting or continuing entity, as determined by the Committee, and in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, then any restrictions to which such Award is subject shall not lapse upon a Change in Control and such Awards, as continued, assumed, replaced, converted or substituted, shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control provided , that with respect to any outstanding Award that is subject to Performance Goals, the Committee may provide that such Award will be converted, assumed or replaced by the resulting or continuing entity as if target performance had been achieved as of the date of the Change in Control and such Awards would continue to remain subject to the time-based service requirements, if any. Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, to the extent outstanding Awards granted under this Plan are continued, assumed, replaced, converted or substituted in accordance with this Section 12(a), if a Participant s employment or service is terminated without Cause by the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company or a Participant terminates his or her employment or service with the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company for Good Reason, in either case, during the two year period immediately following a Change in Control, all outstanding Awards held by the Participant that may be exercised shall become fully exercisable and all restrictions with respect to outstanding Awards shall lapse and become vested and non-forfeitable. 
 (b) If Awards are not continued, assumed, replaced, converted or substituted in accordance with Section 12(a), then a Participant s Awards may be treated in accordance with one or more of the following methods, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion 
 (i) The Committee may accelerate the exercisability of, or lapse of restrictions on, Awards or provide for a period of time for exercise prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control (with such exercise being contingent on the occurrence of the Change in Control, and, provided that, if the Change in Control does not take place within a specified period after giving such notice to exercise for any reason whatsoever, the notice and exercise pursuant thereto shall be null and void) 
 (ii) Any one or more outstanding Awards may be cancelled and the Committee may cause to be paid to the holders thereof, in cash, shares of common stock, other securities or other property, or any combination thereof, the value of such Awards, if any, as determined by the Committee (which, if applicable, may be based upon the price per Share received or to be received by other stockholders of the Company in such event), including without limitation, in the case of an outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right, a cash payment in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value (as determined by the Committee) of the Shares subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right over the aggregate exercise price of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, respectively (it being understood that, in such event, any Option or Stock Appreciation Right having a per share exercise price equal to, or in excess of, the fair market value of a Share subject thereto may be canceled and terminated without any payment or consideration therefor) and or 
 (iii) The Committee may, in its sole discretion, make any other determination as to the treatment of Awards in connection with such Change in Control as the Committee may determine. 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any provision of this Plan or an Award Agreement would cause a payment of deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A of the Code to be made upon the occurrence of (i) a Change in Control, then such payment shall not be made unless such Change in Control also constitutes a change in ownership , change in effective control or change in ownership of a substantial portion of the Company s assets within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code or (ii) a termination of employment or service, then such payment shall not be made unless such termination of employment or service also constitutes a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Any payment that would have been made except for the application of the preceding sentence shall be made in accordance with the payment schedule that would have applied in the absence of a Change in Control or termination of employment or service but disregarding any future service or performance requirements. Notwithstanding 
 10 

anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of Incentive Stock Options, any assumed or substituted Option shall comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1 (and any amendment thereto).

 11

No Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards.

(i) A Participant may be required to pay to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company, and the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company shall have the right and is hereby authorized to withhold from any Award, from any payment due or transfer made under any Award or under the Plan, or from any compensation or other amount owing to a Participant the amount (in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property) of any applicable withholding taxes in respect of an Award, its exercise, or any payment or transfer under an Award or under the Plan, and to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. 
 (ii) Without limiting the generality of clause (i) above, subject to the Company s consent, a Participant may satisfy, in whole or in part, the foregoing withholding liability by delivery of Shares owned by the Participant (which are not subject to any pledge or other security interest and which have been owned by the Participant for at least six months) with a Fair Market Value equal to such withholding liability or by having the Company withhold from the number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant with respect to an Award a number of Shares with a Fair Market Value equal to such withholding liability as determined by the Company, or by such other methods as may be approved by the Committee, including, but not limited to, through a broker-assisted cashless exercise.

 (f) Detrimental Activity and Recapture . Awards hereunder shall be subject to cancellation or forfeiture of an Award or the forfeiture and repayment to the Company of any gain related to an Award, or other provisions intended to have a similar effect, upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee from time to time, if a Participant during employment or other service with the Company or a subsidiary, shall engage in activity detrimental to the Company, whether discovered before or after the employment or service period. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, any Award Agreement may also provide for the cancellation or forfeiture of an Award or the forfeiture and repayment to the Company of any gain related to an Award, or other provision intended to have a similar effect, upon such terms and conditions as may be required by the Committee under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or regulations promulgated by the SEC or any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Shares may be traded, or pursuant to any policy implemented or adopted by the Company. 
 (g) Award Agreements . Each Award hereunder that is not immediately vested and delivered as of its date of grant shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement which shall be delivered to the Participant and shall specify the terms and conditions of the Award and any rules applicable thereto, including but not limited to, the effect on such Award of the death, disability or termination of employment or service of a Participant and the effect, if any, of such other events as may be determined by the Committee. 
 (h) No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements . Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company from adopting or continuing in effect other compensation arrangements, which may, but need not, provide for the grant of options, restricted stock, Shares and other types of 
 12 

Awards provided for hereunder (subject to stockholder approval if such approval is required), and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. 
 (i) No Right to Employment . The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of, or in any consulting relationship to, or as a director on the Board or board of directors, as applicable, of, the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company. Further, the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment or discontinue any consulting relationship, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any applicable employment contract or agreement. 
 (j) No Rights as Stockholder .

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with each grant of Restricted Stock hereunder, the applicable Award shall specify if and to what extent the Participant shall be entitled to the rights of a stockholder in respect of such Restricted Stock. 
 (k) Governing Law . Unless otherwise provided for in an applicable Award Agreement, the validity, construction, and effect of the Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, applied without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. 
 (l) Severability . If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect. 
 (m) Other Laws . The Committee may refuse to issue or transfer any Shares or other consideration under an Award if, acting in its sole discretion, it determines that the issuance or transfer of such Shares or such other consideration might violate any applicable law or regulation or result in any liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, and any payment tendered to the Company by a Participant, other holder or beneficiary in connection with the exercise of such Award shall be promptly refunded to the relevant Participant, holder or beneficiary. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Award granted hereunder shall be construed as an offer to sell securities of the Company, and no such offer shall be outstanding, unless and until the Committee in its sole discretion has determined that any such offer, if made, would be in compliance with all applicable requirements of the U.S. federal securities laws. 
 (n) Foreign Employees . In order to facilitate the making of any Award or combination of Awards under this Plan, the Committee may provide for such special terms for awards to Participants who are foreign nationals or who are employed by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company outside of the United States of America as the Committee may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy or custom. Moreover, the Committee may approve such supplements to or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of this Plan (including, without limitation, sub-plans) as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes, without thereby affecting the terms of this Plan as in effect for any other purpose, and the Secretary or other appropriate officer of the Company may certify any such document as having been approved and adopted in the same manner as this Plan. No such special terms, supplements, amendments or restatements, however, shall include any provisions that are inconsistent with the terms of this Plan as then in effect unless this Plan could have been amended to eliminate such inconsistency without further approval by the stockholders of the Company. 
 (o) No Trust or Fund Created . Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of 
 13 

the Company and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company. 
 (p) No Fractional Shares . No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash, other securities, or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be cancelled, terminated, or otherwise eliminated. 
 (q) Deferrals . In the event the Committee permits a Participant to defer any Award payable in the form of cash, all such elective deferrals shall be accomplished by the delivery of a written, irrevocable election by the Participant on a form provided by the Company. All deferrals shall be made in accordance with administrative guidelines established by the Committee to ensure that such deferrals comply with all applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code. 
 (r) Headings . Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof. 
 Section 14. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code. 
 (a) To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Plan and any grants made hereunder comply with, or be exempt from, the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, so that the income inclusion provisions of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code do not apply to the Participants. This Plan and any grants made hereunder shall be administered in a manner consistent with this intent. Any reference in this Plan to Section 409A of the Code will also include any regulations or any other formal guidance promulgated with respect to such Section by the U.S. Department of Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service. In any case, a Participant shall be solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may be imposed on a Participant or for a Participant s account in connection with this Plan and grants hereunder (including any taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code), and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold a Participant harmless from any or all of such taxes or penalties.
