 (1) The provision is comprised of estimated credit losses based on the Company s loss-rate experience and includes adjustments required for forecasted credit loss information. The provision for credit losses reported within this table also includes the provision for fraud losses. 
 (2) Consists primarily of charges to other accounts. The Company earns revenue by assessing monthly finance fees on accounts with overdue balances. These fees are recognized as revenue at the time the fees are assessed. The finance fee is calculated using the greater of a minimum charge or a stated late fee rate multiplied by the outstanding balance that is subject to a late fee charge. On occasion, these fees are waived to maintain relationship goodwill. Charges to other accounts substantially represent the offset against the late fee revenue recognized when the Company establishes a reserve for such waived amounts.

 The receivables portfolio primarily consists of a large group of homogeneous balances across a wide range of industries, which are collectively evaluated for impairment. No individual customer had a receivable balance representing 10 percent or more of the outstanding receivables balance at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Less than 60 days past due 
 
 million of the Company s outstanding common stock (the 2024 ASR ). The Company accounted for the 2024 ASR as separate transactions, with the initial delivery of shares accounted for as a treasury stock transaction and the undelivered shares as a forward contract indexed to our common stock. 
 Under the 2024 ASR, the Company made an initial payment of million to JPMorgan for which we received an initial delivery of approximately million shares of our common stock, representing approximately percent of the total shares of WEX common stock expected to be repurchased under the ASR agreement. The payment was initially recorded as million of treasury stock, based on the percent initial share delivery, and a million temporary reduction to additional paid-in capital until final settlement of the 2024 ASR, which is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2024.

 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an ASR agreement with JPMorgan. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded the initial delivery of shares in treasury stock at cost, which resulted in an immediate reduction of its outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. Had the 2024 ASR been settled as of September 30, 2024, determined based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the Company s common stock per share since its effective date, JPMorgan would have been required to deliver additional estimated shares to the Company. The effect of the potential share settlement under the 2024 ASR was excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as its inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

Further, the Fifth Amendment increased commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to billion, repriced the applicable interest margin for the Revolving Credit Facility, and extended the maturity date to May 10, 2029 for the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Convertible Notes 
 The Company previously had issued Convertible Notes in an aggregate principal amount of million to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus LLC. Interest on the Convertible Notes was calculated at a fixed rate of percent per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. On August 11, 2023, the Company repurchased all of the outstanding million aggregate principal amount of the Company s Convertible Notes at percent of par for a total purchase price of million, inclusive of accrued and unpaid interest. At the time of repurchase, the net carrying

million, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of million, which was recorded within nonoperating expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations during the third quarter of 2023. Upon repurchase, the obligations of the Company to Warburg Pincus LLC were satisfied in full and the Convertible Notes were canceled by the trustee at the instruction of the Company. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized interest expense of million and million, respectively. 
 Securitization Facilities 
 Under securitized debt agreements, each month on a revolving basis, the Company sells certain of its Australian and European receivables to bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries consolidated by the Company, which in turn use the receivables as collateral to issue securitized debt. Amounts collected on the securitized receivables are restricted to pay the securitized debt and are not available for general corporate purposes. The Company pays interest on the outstanding balance of the securitized debt based on variable interest rates plus an applicable margin. 
 The Company s securitized debt agreement for the securitization of its European receivables is with MUFG Bank, Ltd., has a maximum revolving borrowing limit of million and expires in April 2025, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties. The Company s securitized debt agreement for the securitization of its Australian receivables is with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, has a maximum revolving borrowing limit of A million, expires in October 2025 and is annually renewable thereafter unless earlier terminated. 
 Participation Debt 
 From time to time, WEX Bank enters into participation agreements with third-party banks to fund customers balances that exceed WEX Bank s lending limit to individual customers. Associated unsecured borrowings generally carry a variable interest rate set according to an applicable reference rate plus a margin, which was percent as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has an outstanding participation agreement which allows for total borrowings of up to million and expires in December 2025, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties. Borrowings under the participation agreement are included in short-term debt given they may be canceled by either party upon 60 days advance written notice. 
 FHLB Advances 
 WEX Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Des Moines, which provides WEX Bank short-term funding collateralized by investment securities. FHLB short-term advances bear interest at variable rates. WEX Bank was eligible to borrow up to million from the FHLB as of September 30, 2024 based on collateral provided, million of which was borrowed and outstanding at that date. 
 Borrowed Federal Funds 
 The BTFP, which provided liquidity to U.S. depository institutions through the offering of bank loans for up to one year in length collateralized by the par value of qualifying assets, ceased extending new loans on March 11, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, WEX Bank had million in outstanding borrowings under the BTFP due in January of 2025 with an interest rate of percent.

 million as of September 30, 2024 of customer receivables held by WEX Bank to the Federal Reserve Bank as collateral for potential borrowings through the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window. Amounts that can be borrowed are based on the amount of collateral pledged and were million as of September 30, 2024. WEX Bank had 
 
 million and million, respectively, while cost of factoring was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Cost of factoring is recorded within cost of services in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 The WEX Europe Services agreement automatically renews each January 1 unless either party gives not less than 90 days written notice of their intention to withdraw. Under this agreement, accounts receivable are sold without recourse to the extent that the customer balances are maintained at or below the credit limit established by the buyer. The Company maintains the risk of default on any customer receivable balances in excess of the buyer s credit limit, which were immaterial as of September 30, 2024. Under this arrangement, the Company sold million and million of accounts receivable during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and sold million and million of accounts receivable during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The WEX Bank agreement, which was renewed during July 2024, has no set expiration date, however, either party can terminate the agreement with days notice. Under this arrangement, the Company sold billion and billion of trade accounts receivable during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and sold billion and billion of trade accounts receivable during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Benefits Securitization 
 In April 2023, WEX Health, through a wholly-owned special purpose entity SPE ), entered into a receivable securitization facility with a revolving limit of million and an initial term through April 2026, which can be extended for an additional period of up to and can be voluntarily terminated by the SPE at any time, subject to days notice. During December 2023, the Company signed an amendment to the initial receivable securitization agreement, which suspends activities under the facility until such time as the parties agree in writing to reactivate it (the Health Facility Amendment ). During this suspension period, the revolving limit of the facility is . 
 Under the facility, and prior to the Health Facility Amendment, WEX Health sold eligible trade accounts receivables to the SPE, which is a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, and in turn, the SPE sold undivided ownership interests in certain of these receivables to the financial institution in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. WEX Health continued to service receivables sold to the financial institution, however, WEX did not retain effective control of transferred receivables, derecognized the assets and accounted for these transfers as sales. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold approximately million and million of receivables under the securitization facility, respectively.

 The above table includes investment positions at September 30, 2024, where the current fair value is less than the related amortized cost. Unrealized losses on the Company s debt securities included in the above table are primarily driven by the elevated interest rate environment and are not considered to be credit-related based upon an analysis that considered the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized basis of a security, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, changes to credit rating of the instrument subsequent to Company purchase, and the strength of the underlying collateral, if any. Additionally, the Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases.

 Mutual Fund 
 The Company determines the fair value of its mutual fund using quoted market prices for identical instruments in an active market; such inputs are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan Trust 
 The investments held in the executive deferred compensation plan trust, which consist primarily of mutual funds, are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy because the fair value is determined using quoted market prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
 Contingent Consideration 
 As part of an asset acquisition from Bell Bank during 2021, the Company is obligated to pay additional consideration to Bell Bank contingent upon increases in the Federal Funds rate. The Company determines the fair value of this contingent consideration derivative liability based on discounted cash flows using the difference between the baseline Federal Funds rate in the purchase agreement with Bell Bank and future forecasted Federal Funds rates over the agreement term. The forecasted Federal Funds rates represent a Level 3 input within the fair value hierarchy. The resulting probability-weighted contingent consideration amounts were discounted using a rate of percent as of September 30, 2024 and percent as of December 31, 2023. Due to significant increases in the Federal Funds rate since we completed the acquisition, the fair value of the Company s contingent consideration derivative liability at September 30, 2024 is effectively measured at the present value of the maximum remaining contingent consideration payable under the arrangement and accordingly, the fair value could not materially increase. A significant decrease in the Federal Funds rate could result in a material decrease in the derivative liability. 
 The Company records changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

percent and percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and percent and percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Income tax expense is based on an estimated annual effective rate, which requires the Company to make its best estimate of annual pretax income or loss. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was adversely impacted by a first quarter discrete tax item of million primarily associated with an uncertain tax position related to state income taxes, however, the vast majority of such impact was offset by excess tax benefits arising from stock-based compensation. The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was adversely impacted by the loss on extinguishment of Convertible Notes of million, which was disallowed for tax purposes. This was partially offset for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 by a release in valuation allowance largely attributable to foreign tax credits and net operating losses in the U.K. recorded during the second quarter of 2023. 
 Undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company amounted to million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company continues to maintain its indefinite reinvestment assertion for its investments in foreign subsidiaries except for any historical undistributed earnings and future earnings for WEX Australia. The total amount of our foreign subsidiaries earnings in which the Company continues to assert indefinite reinvestment approximates million at September 30, 2024. Upon distribution of these earnings, the Company would be subject to withholding taxes payable to foreign countries, where applicable, but would generally have no further federal income tax liability. It is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings; however, it is not expected to be material. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD Pillar Two global minimum tax rules, which generally provide for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 percent, are intended to apply for tax years beginning in 2024. On July 17, 2023, the OECD published Administrative Guidance proposing certain safe harbor rules that effectively extend certain effective dates to January 1, 2027. The Company is closely monitoring developments and evaluating the impact of these new rules, including eligibility to qualify for these safe harbor rules. We do not expect the impact of these new rules to have a material effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 (2) Our net payment processing rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 has benefited from lower average domestic fuel prices and higher rates earned from merchant contract renewals at favorable terms. 
 
 Total Mobility revenue increased 7.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 23.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The net increases resulted primarily from higher rates earned under favorable contract renewals and the impact of the Payzer Acquisition. Partly offsetting these increases were lower average domestic fuel prices and a charge for operational issues impacting certain finance fee calculations. 
 Finance fee revenue, which is comprised of the following components, is discussed below. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2024 2023 Amount 2024 2023 Amount Finance income 59.0 66.4 (7.4) (11) 186.8 202.8 (16.0) (8) Factoring fee revenue 11.2 10.4 0.8 8 31.2 30.7 0.5 2 Finance fee revenue 70.2 76.8 (6.6) (9) 217.9 233.5 (15.6) (7) 
 Finance income primarily consists of late fees charged for receivables not paid within the terms of the customer agreement based upon the outstanding customer receivable balance, and to a lesser degree by finance charges earned on revolving portfolio balances. Late fee revenue is earned when a customer s receivable balance becomes delinquent and is calculated using the greater of a minimum charge or a stated late fee rate multiplied by the outstanding balance that is subject to a late fee charge. Changes in the absolute amount of such outstanding balances can generally be attributed to: (i) changes in fuel prices; (ii) customer specific transaction volume; and (iii) customer specific delinquencies. Late fee revenue can also be impacted by: (i) changes in late fee rates; and (ii) increases or decreases in customer overdue balances.

 Finance income decreased 7.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease in finance income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods was driven by a decline in the number of late fee instances, reflective of the tighter credit policies we put in place during mid-2023, and by lower domestic fuel prices, offset in part by increases in contractual late fee rates charged during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Concessions to certain customers experiencing financial difficulties may be granted and are limited to extending the time to pay, placing a customer on a payment plan or granting waivers of late fees. There were no material concessions granted to customers experiencing financial difficulties during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The primary source of factoring fee revenue is calculated as a negotiated percentage fee of the receivable balance that we purchase. Factoring fee revenue for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained consistent with that of the same periods in the prior year.

 Cost of services 
 Provision for credit losses, which includes estimates for both credit and fraud losses, decreased 4.4 million and 31.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Stabilization in the over-the-road trucking market, tighter credit policies put in place to reduce losses, and lower than expected charge-offs from macroeconomic factors have all contributed to the reduction in the provision for the

 three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. We generally measure our loss performance by calculating fuel-related losses as a percentage of total fuel expenditures on payment processing transactions. This metric for provision for credit losses was 5.8 and 11.6 basis points of fuel expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, provision for credit losses was 6.8 and 17.8 basis points of fuel expenditures, respectively. 
 Operating interest increased 3.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 18.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily reflective of higher interest rates on operating debt balances in support of working capital needs. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 4.5 million and 11.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year comparable periods due in part to the amortization of intangible assets obtained as part of the Payzer Acquisition and increased capital expenditures to support growth. 
 Other operating expenses 
 General and administrative expense decreased 12.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of the prior year, primarily due to a third quarter 2023 write-off of certain costs associated with an abandoned IT development project and higher professional services expense in the prior year periods. 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased 14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to increased employee costs as a result of the Payzer Acquisition along with an increase in costs targeted at driving growth.

 NM - Not meaningful 
 (1) Our net interchange rate has increased during the third quarter of 2024 and decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of the prior year, primarily due to changes in customer mix. 
 Total Corporate Payments revenue decreased 8.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 21.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year was due primarily to a reduction in purchase volume. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of the prior year, was primarily driven by greater purchase volumes in both travel and corporate payments and higher interest revenue earned during the first quarter on restricted cash balances as a result of a rise in interest rates and average balances.

 (1) Segment adjusted operating income excludes unallocated corporate expenses, acquisition-related intangible amortization, other acquisition and divestiture related items, debt restructuring costs, stock-based compensation, other costs and certain non-recurring or non-cash operating charges that are not core to our operations, as applicable depending on the period presented. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures later in this Item 2 for a reconciliation of operating income to total segment adjusted operating income. See also Part I Item 1 Note 17, Segment Information, to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segment determination. 
 (2) Segment adjusted operating income margin is calculated by dividing segment adjusted operating income by segment revenue. See below for an explanation of changes to our year over year segment adjusted operating margin. 
 As a result of owning all of our technology and issuing capabilities, our Corporate Payments segment has a highly scalable and relatively fixed cost base resulting in largely comparable expenses year to year. As a result, changes in revenue similarly impact operating income, segment adjusted operating income and segment adjusted operating income margin. Instances in which our expenses for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 did not remain comparable to those of the comparable 2023 periods are described hereafter. 
 The increases in provision for credit losses during the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not meaningful as such increases were substantially driven by a recovery of provision for credit losses during the prior year comparable periods. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 2.1 million and 6.2 million during the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due primarily to the depreciation of certain travel-related payments processing assets placed into service during the first quarter of 2024. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 1.5 million and 8.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year due primarily to higher professional services expense in the prior year periods.

 Total Benefits revenue increased 15.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 62.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. A rise in average HSA deposit balances held by WEX Bank and interest rates earned on the investment of such balances, as reflected within other revenue, coupled with increased revenues due to the Ascensus Acquisition, substantially contributed to the increase in total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparable periods.

See also Part I Item 1 Note 17, Segment Information, to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segment determination. 
 (2) Segment adjusted operating income margin is calculated by dividing segment adjusted operating income by segment revenue. Revenue earned on HSA assets is highly accretive to earnings and is the primary driver of the increase in segment adjusted operating income margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparable periods. 
 Cost of services 
 Processing costs increased 17.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased employee costs as a result of the Ascensus Acquisition, along with higher technology costs incurred in support of volume growth. 
 Service fees increased by 2.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the same periods in the prior year, in conjunction with the associated growth in revenues. 
 Depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.5 million as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to software assets recently placed into service. 
 Other operating expenses 
 General and administrative expense decreased 4.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year, due primarily to higher professional services expense in the prior year periods. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 3.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 12.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets obtained as part of the Ascensus Acquisition. 
 
 Unallocated corporate expenses 
 Unallocated corporate expenses represent the portion of expenses relating to general corporate functions, including acquisition and divestiture expenses, certain finance, legal, information technology, human resources, administrative and executive expenses, and other expenses not directly attributable to a reportable segment.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, unallocated corporate expenses decreased 5.4 million as compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to a reduction in variable compensation and higher professional costs incurred in the prior year period in connection with the Ascensus Acquisition. 
 
 Non-operating income and expense

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company benefited from net gains on interest rate swap financing instruments. In addition, increased borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, coupled with higher interest rates, offset in part by a reduction in interest due to the repurchase and cancellation of our Convertible Notes during the third quarter of 2023, further contributed to the increase in expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
 During August 2023, we repurchased all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company s Convertible Notes at a premium resulting in a loss on extinguishment of 70.1 million. 
 Our foreign currency exchange exposure is primarily related to the remeasurement of our cash, receivable and payable balances, including intercompany transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. Losses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from the weakening of certain foreign currencies in which we transact, including the Euro, and the Australian and Canadian dollars, relative to the U.S. dollar over the course of the year. However, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a gain attributable to the rebound of certain foreign currencies, particularly the Euro and Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar. 
 The increase in income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparable periods is due primarily to an increase in the Company s taxable income, offset in part by a decrease in our effective tax rates. The Company s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 27.1 percent and 27.2 percent, respectively, compared to 58.6 percent and 30.2 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. See Part I Item 1 Note 14, Income Taxes, to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the drivers behind our effective tax rates. 
 
 Non GAAP Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures 
 Total Segment Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income 
 In addition to evaluating the Company s performance on a GAAP basis, Company management uses particular non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, to evaluate our overall operating performance, including comparison across periods and with competitors. Our management team believes these non-GAAP measures are integral to our reporting and planning processes and uses them to assess operating performance because they generally exclude financial results that are outside the normal course of our business operations or management s control. These measures are also used to allocate resources among our operating segments and for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes for both short- and long-term operating plans. 
 Total segment adjusted operating income excludes unallocated corporate expenses, acquisition-related intangible amortization, other acquisition and divestiture related items, debt restructuring costs, stock-based compensation, other 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 costs and certain non-recurring or non-cash operating charges that are not core to our operations, as applicable depending on the period presented. 
 Adjusted net income , which similarly excludes the impact of all items excluded in total segment adjusted operating income except unallocated corporate expenses, further excludes unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments, net foreign currency gains and losses, debt issuance cost amortization, tax related items, and certain other non-operating items, as applicable depending on the period presented. 
 For the periods presented herein, the following items have been excluded in determining one or more non-GAAP measures for the following reasons: 
 Exclusion of the non-cash, mark-to-market adjustments on financial instruments, including interest rate swap agreements and investment securities, helps management identify and assess trends in the Company s underlying business that might otherwise be obscured due to quarterly non-cash earnings fluctuations associated with these financial instruments. Additionally, the non-cash, mark-to-market adjustments on financial instruments are difficult to forecast accurately, making comparisons across historical and future periods difficult to evaluate; 
 Net foreign currency gains and losses primarily result from the remeasurement to functional currency of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable balances, certain intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies and any gain or loss on foreign currency economic hedges relating to these items. The exclusion of these items helps management compare changes in operating results between periods that might otherwise be obscured due to currency fluctuations; 
 The change in fair value of contingent consideration, which is related to the acquisition of certain contractual rights to serve as custodian or sub-custodian to HSAs, is dependent upon changes in future interest rate assumptions and has no significant impact on the ongoing operations of the Company. Additionally, the non-cash, mark-to-market adjustments on financial instruments are difficult to forecast accurately, making comparisons across historical and future periods difficult to evaluate; 
 The Company considers certain acquisition-related costs, including certain financing costs, investment banking fees, warranty and indemnity insurance, certain integration-related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles, as well as gains and losses from divestitures to be unpredictable, dependent on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired or divested business or the Company. In addition, the size and complexity of an acquisition, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition-related costs, may not be indicative of such future costs. The Company believes that excluding acquisition-related costs and gains or losses on divestitures facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the Company s historical operating results and to other companies in our industry; 
 Stock-based compensation is different from other forms of compensation as it is a non-cash expense. For example, a cash salary generally has a fixed and unvarying cash cost. In contrast, the expense associated with an equity-based award is generally unrelated to the amount of cash ultimately received by the employee, and the cost to the Company is based on a stock-based compensation valuation methodology and underlying assumptions that may vary over time; 
 Other costs are not consistently occurring and do not reflect expected future operating expense, nor do they provide insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business. This also includes non-recurring professional service costs, costs related to certain identified initiatives, including restructuring and technology initiatives, to further streamline the business, improve the Company s efficiency, create synergies and globalize the Company s operations, all with an objective to improve scale and efficiency and increase profitability going forward. 
 Impairment charges represent non-cash asset write-offs, which do not reflect recurring costs that would be relevant to the Company s continuing operations. The Company believes that excluding these nonrecurring expenses facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the Company s historical operating results and to other companies in its industry; 
 Debt restructuring and debt issuance cost amortization, which for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes the loss on extinguishment of Convertible Notes, are unrelated to the continuing operations of the Company. Debt restructuring costs are not consistently occurring and do not reflect expected future operating expense, nor do they provide insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business. In addition, since debt issuance cost amortization is dependent upon the financing method, which can vary widely company to company, we believe that excluding these costs helps to facilitate comparison to historical results as well as to other companies within our industry; 
 The tax related items are the difference between the Company s GAAP tax provision and a non-GAAP tax provision. Beginning in fiscal year 2024, the Company utilizes a fixed annual projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across reporting periods. To determine this long-term projected tax rate, the Company performs a pro forma tax provision based upon the Company s projected adjusted net income before taxes. The fixed annual projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change in future periods for a variety of reasons, 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to our strategy or business operations; and 
 The Company does not allocate certain corporate expenses to our operating segments, as these items are centrally controlled and are not directly attributable to any reportable segment. 
 
 Total segment adjusted operating income and adjusted net income may be useful to investors as a means of evaluating our performance. However, because total segment adjusted operating income and adjusted net income are non-GAAP measures, they should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, operating income or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Total segment adjusted operating income and adjusted net income as used by WEX may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Under the if-converted method, interest expense, net of tax, associated with our Convertible Notes of 1.8 million and 9.5 million was added back to adjusted net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 0.7 million and 1.3 million shares of the Company s common stock associated with the assumed conversion of the Convertible Notes (prior to repurchase and cancellation) was included in the calculation of adjusted net income per dilutive share, respectively, as the effect of including such adjustments was dilutive. For further information about the Convertible Notes and their repurchase and cancellation, see Note 10, Financing and Other Debt. The total number of shares used in calculating adjusted net income per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 40.8 million and 41.7 million, respectively. The total number of shares used in calculating adjusted net income per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 44.1 million and 44.7 million, respectively.

 Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 The Company s non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow has historically been calculated as cash flows from operating activities adjusted for net purchases of current investment securities, capital expenditures, net Funding Activity, and certain other adjustments including contingent and deferred consideration paid to sellers in excess of acquisition-date fair value. Such calculation has historically been based on the principle that the net activity in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and investment of HSA deposits would be offset by WEX Bank Funding Activity, however, due to the nature of WEX Bank cash balances, they may be increased or decreased for reasons other than matching operating activity. As a result, beginning with the third quarter of 2024, adjusted free cash flow also includes an adjustment to reflect the change in WEX Bank cash balances and the applicable prior periods have similarly been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. 
 Although non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, WEX believes that adjusted free cash flow is a useful measure for investors to further evaluate our results of operations because (i) adjusted free cash flow indicates the level of cash generated by the operations of the business, which excludes consideration paid on acquisitions, after appropriate reinvestment for recurring investments in property, equipment and capitalized software that are required to operate the business; (ii) net Funding Activity includes fluctuations in deposits and other borrowings primarily used as part of our accounts receivable funding strategy; (iii) purchases of current investment securities are made as a result of deposits gathered operationally; and (iv) WEX Bank cash balances may be increased or decreased for reasons other than matching operating activity. However, because adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, it should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, operating cash flow as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, adjusted free cash flow as used by WEX may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 
 The following table reconciles GAAP operating cash flow to adjusted free cash flow:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We fund our business operations primarily via cash on hand, cash generated from operations, the issuance of deposits, and borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 535.4 million, including Corporate Cash of 123.2 million, and remaining borrowing availability of 606.3 million under the Revolving Credit Facility along with access to various sources of funds, including uncommitted federal funds lines of credit from other banks. 
 Our short-term cash requirements consist primarily of funding the working capital needs of our business, payments on maturities of deposits, current principal and interest payments on the credit facilities under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and payments on other short-term debt. Our long-term cash requirements consist primarily of amounts owed under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and various facilities lease agreements. 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generating capabilities, financial condition and operations, and access to available funding sources will be adequate to fund our cash needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. The table below includes a more comprehensive list of frequent sources and uses of cash:

 (1) During May 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which increased commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to 1.6 billion, increased the size of the tranche A term loan facility to 900.0 million, repriced the applicable interest margin for the tranche A term loans and Revolving Credit Facility and extended the maturity date to May 2029 for both the tranche A term loans and Revolving Credit Facility. Under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as of September 30, 2024 the Company had outstanding term loan principal borrowings of 2,269.3 million , borrowings of 954.3 million on the Revolving Credit Facility and letters of credit of 39.4 million drawn against the Revolving Credit Facility. See Part I Item 1 Note 10, Financing and Other Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
 (2) WEX Bank s regulatory status enables it to raise capital to fund the Company s working capital requirements by issuing deposits, subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC and the UDFI. Additionally, WEX Bank holds deposits for the benefit of WEX Inc. s HSA customers subject to the terms of a deposit agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we had 4,461.5 million in total deposits. See Part I Item 1 Note 9, Deposits, to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our deposits. 
 (3) The Company utilizes securitized debt agreements to finance a portion of our receivables, lower our cost of borrowing and more efficiently utilize capital. The Company had 96.5 million of securitized debt under these facilities as of September 30, 2024. We also utilize off-balance sheet factoring and securitization arrangements to sell certain of our accounts receivable to unrelated third-party financial institutions in order to accelerate the collection of the Company s cash and reduce internal costs. Available capacity is dependent on the level of our trade accounts receivable eligible to be sold and the financial institutions willingness to purchase such receivables. However, the Company is not dependent on them to maintain its liquidity and capital resources. See Part I Item 1 Notes 10, Financing and Other Debt and 11, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information about the Company s securitized debt and off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 (4) From time to time, WEX Bank enters into participation agreements with third-party banks to fund customers balances that exceed WEX Bank s lending limit to individual customers. There was 57.2 million borrowed against these participation agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 (5) WEX Bank borrows from short-term uncommitted federal funds lines of credit from time to time to supplement the financing of the Company s accounts receivable. There were 150.0 million of outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit as of September 30, 2024. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides them collateralized short-term funding. As of September 30, 2024, WEX Bank had 370.0 million of advances outstanding, secured by 420.5 million in fair value of investment securities. See Part I Item 1 Note 10, Financing and Other Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these facilities.

 Additional Sources of Cash Available 
 On March 12, 2023, the Federal Reserve Board announced the BTFP, which provided liquidity to U.S. depository institutions. This program allowed bank loans for up to one year in length, collateralized by the par value of qualifying assets, including U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Advances were available for a one-year period until March 11, 2024, at which time the BTFP ceased making new loans. WEX Bank accessed 710.0 million of temporary, low-cost capital under the BTFP as of September 30, 2024, pledging held investment securities with a par value of 721.1 million and market value of 663.4 million as collateral. 
 WEX Bank has the ability to borrow funds from the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window. Borrowing limits fluctuate based on pledged assets, and as of September 30, 2024, the Company could borrow up to a maximum amount of 167.0 million . WEX Bank had no borrowings outstanding on this line of credit as of September 30, 2024. See Part I Item 1 Note 10, Financing and Other Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding this borrowing arrangement. 
 Cash Flows 
 The table below summarizes our cash activities and adjusted free cash flow: Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used for) 
 Operating activities (157.0) 146.0 Investing activities (724.0) (1,571.4) Financing activities (41.1) 1,705.3 Non-GAAP financial measure: Adjusted free cash flow 1 
 392.5 335.4 
 (1) The Company s non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow has historically been calculated as cash flows from operating activities adjusted for net purchases of current investment securities, capital expenditures, net Funding Activity, and certain other adjustments including contingent and deferred consideration paid to sellers in excess of acquisition-date fair value. Such calculation has historically been based on the principle that the net activity in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and investment of HSA deposits would be offset by WEX Bank Funding Activity, however, due to the nature of WEX Bank cash balances, they may be increased or decreased for reasons other than matching operating activity. As a result, beginning with the third quarter of 2024, adjusted free cash flow also includes an adjustment to reflect the change in WEX Bank cash balances and the applicable prior periods have similarly been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. For an updated definition of adjusted free cash flow and a reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, and the reasons why we believe this is an important financial measure, please refer to the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures. 
 Operating Activities 
 We fund a customer s entire receivable in the majority of our Mobility and Corporate Payment processing transactions, while the revenue generated by these transactions is only a small percentage of that amount. Consequently, cash flows from operations are impacted significantly by increases or decreases in fuel prices and purchase volumes, driving changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable balances, which directly impact our capital resource requirements. 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 303.0 million as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease year over year was primarily the result of a reduction in accounts payable, coupled with 64.5 million in contingent consideration paid to Bell Bank during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing cash flows generally consist of capital expenditures, cash used for acquisitions and the investment of custodial cash assets. 
 Cash used for investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 847.4 million as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily resulting from lower investment of HSA deposits in available-for-sale debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparable period. Costs expended on acquisitions were also lower during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year as a result of the Ascensus Acquisition, which closed on September 1, 2023.

 Financing Activities 
 Financing cash flows generally consist of the issuance and repayment of debt and deposits, changes in restricted cash payable and purchases of our common stock. Repurchases of our common stock may vary based on management s evaluation of market and economic conditions and other factors. 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1,746.4 million, due primarily to a decrease in our restricted cash payable and net deposits, along with increased share repurchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company expended 543.6 million toward the return of capital to shareholders through the repurchase of approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock subject to an authorized and outstanding share repurchase program. Such shares are exclusive of any shares expected to be delivered during the fourth quarter of 2024 upon settlement of our previously announced ASR. 
 During September 2024, the Company s board of directors authorized an amended share repurchase program under which up to an additional 1.0 billion worth of WEX s common stock may be repurchased by the Company through December 31, 2025, expanding the total authorization from 1.05 billion to 2.05 billion. As of September 30, 2024, there was 1,069.8 million worth of common stock available to be purchased pursuant to the repurchase plan authorization. 
 Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 The definition of adjusted free cash flow, which beginning with the third quarter of 2024 also includes an adjustment to reflect the change in WEX Bank cash balances, and the reasons why we believe it to be an important financial measure, can be found in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures . 
 Adjusted free cash flow increased 57.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year, consistent with the increase in adjusted operating income for the same periods. 
 Financial Covenants 
 The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain customary exceptions, limit the Company and its subsidiaries (including, in certain limited circumstances, WEX Bank and the Company s other regulated subsidiaries) ability to, among other things (i) incur additional debt, (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock, or make investments or other restricted payments, (iii) enter into transactions with affiliates, (iv) dispose of assets or issue stock of restricted subsidiaries or regulated subsidiaries, (v) create liens on assets, or (vi) effect a consolidation or merger or sell all, or substantially all, of the Company s assets. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary financial maintenance covenants, including a consolidated interest coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with applicable covenants. See Part II Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources and Part II Item 8 Note 16, Financing and Other Debt, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information regarding these covenants. 
 Other Commitments, Contingencies and Contractual Obligations 
 There were no material changes to our contractual obligations from the information previously provided in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 WEX Bank is subject to a consent order issued by the FDIC on September 20, 2023 (the 2023 Order ), which requires WEX Bank to make certain improvements, which include corrections of certain issues identified in the 2023 Order and general enhancements to WEX Bank s compliance management program. Customer impact and any resulting harm from the violations detailed in the 2023 Order have been identified and steps have been taken to remediate any such impact and harm. The terms of the 2023 Order will remain in effect and be enforceable until they are modified, terminated, suspended or set aside by the FDIC. The matters identified in the 2023 Order have not had, nor are they expected to have, a material effect on WEX Bank s operations or the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
