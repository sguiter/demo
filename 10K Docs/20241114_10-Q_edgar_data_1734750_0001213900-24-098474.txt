million and million, respectively. 

On April 2, 2024, the Company entered into
a securities purchase agreement for the private placement April 2024 Private Placement of an aggregate of units
with each unit consisting of (1) one share of the Company s common stock or at the election of the purchaser, a pre-funded warrant
to purchase one share of common stock, and (2) one warrant to purchase one share of common stock. The purchase price paid for each unit
was . Certain directors and officers participated in the transaction and purchased of the units at an offering price
of per unit. 

Pre-funded warrants totaling shares
were issued as part of the April 2024 Private Placement. Each pre-funded warrant has an exercise price equal to per share or calculated
pursuant to the cashless exercise provision. The pre-funded warrants were immediately exercisable on the date of issuance and do not
expire. 

Warrants totaling shares were issued as part of the April
2024 Private Placement. Each warrant that was issued to holders other than the Company s officers and directors has an exercise
price equal to per share or calculated pursuant to the cashless exercise provision. The warrants issued to the Company s officers
and directors have an exercise price equal to or calculated pursuant to the cashless exercise provision. The warrants were exercisable
immediately and expire on the fifth anniversary of the initial exercise date of the warrant. After April 4, 2025, the warrants may be
redeemed in whole or in part at the option of the Company with at least thirty days notice to the holder of the warrant, which
notice may not be given before, but may be given at any time after the date on which (i) the closing price of the Company s common
stock has equaled or exceeded for ten consecutive trading days and (ii) the daily trading volume of the common stock has exceeded
 shares on each of such ten trading days. The redemption price is per warrant share. 

The gross proceeds of the April 2024 Private Placement
were approximately million, before deducting offering fees and expenses of approximately million. The April 2024 Private Placement
closed on April 5, 2024. Common stock shares of were issued. 

The
Company has incurred losses from operations and has generated negative cash flows from operating activities since inception. The Company
expects to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as it continues the development of its technology. The Company s
ultimate success depends on the outcome of its research and development and commercialization activities, for which it expects to incur
additional losses in the future. Through September 30, 2024, the Company has relied primarily on the proceeds from equity offerings
to finance its operations. The Company expects to require additional financing to fund its future planned operations, including research
and development and commercialization of its products. The Company will likely raise additional capital through the issuance of equity,
borrowings, or strategic alliances with partner companies. However, if such financing is not available at adequate levels, the Company
would need to reevaluate its operating plans. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred significant losses and has an
accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such
time, if ever, that it can generate significant sales. The Company s existence is dependent upon management s ability to
obtain additional funding sources. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 

Adequate
additional financing may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional
capital and/or enter into strategic alliances when needed or on attractive terms, it would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate its
product or any commercialization efforts. There can be no assurance that the Company s efforts will result in the resolution of
the Company s liquidity needs. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Dividend
Rate The expected dividend rate was assumed to be zero, as the Company had not previously paid dividends on common stock and
has no current plans to do so. 

Expected
Volatility The expected volatility was derived from the historical stock volatilities of several public companies within the
Company s industry that the Company considers to be comparable to the business over a period equivalent to the expected term of
the stock option grants. 

Risk-Free
Interest Rate The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest yield in effect at the date of grant for zero coupon U.
S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the option s expected term. 

Expected
Term The expected term represents the period that the Company s stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected
term of option grants that are considered to be plain vanilla are determined using the simplified method. The simplified
method deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. For other option grants not considered
to be plain vanilla, the Company determined the expected term to be the contractual life of the options. 

Forfeiture
Rate The Company recognizes forfeitures when they occur.

Litigation 

From
time to time, the Company may become involved in various litigation and administrative proceedings relating to claims arising from its
operations in the normal course of business. Management is not currently aware of any matters that may have a material adverse impact
on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Indemnification 

The
Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company
indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party,
in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect
to its technology. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual after the execution of the agreement. The maximum
potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable because it involves
claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been made. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits
or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. 

The
Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company to indemnify its directors
and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities
arising from willful misconduct of the individual. 

No
amounts associated with such indemnifications have been recorded as of September 30, 2024. 

Non-cancelable
Obligations 

The
Company did not have any non-cancelable contractual commitments as of September 30, 2024. 

Royalty
Commitments 

The Company is required to make certain usage-based royalty payments
to a vendor. The royalty amount is calculated based on the number of Evie Rings shipped, as adjusted for returns and refunds to customers,
and the number of specified algorithms developed by the vendor that are included on the Evie Rings. The maximum amount of the royalty
commitment is approximately million, and the amount of the research and development expenses paid to the vendor will reduce
the total royalty commitment amount. Through September 30, 2024, the Company has paid research and development expenses of approximately
 million to the vendor. The amount of the royalty calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023 was not significant.

Forward-Looking
Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are intended to be covered by the safe
harbor created by those sections. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans,
strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as believe, expect, 
 may, will, should, would, could, seek, intend, 
 plan, goal, project, estimate, anticipate, strategy ,
 future , likely or other comparable terms and references to future periods. All statements other than statements
of historical facts included in this Form 10-Q regarding our strategies, prospects, financial condition, operations, costs, plans and
objectives are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding
expectations for revenues, cash flows and financial performance, the anticipated results of our development efforts, product features
and the timing for receipt of required regulatory approvals and product launches. 

Forward-looking
statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations
and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy
and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks
and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial
condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these
forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those
indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 

our limited operating history
 and our ability to achieve profitability; 

the failure of our common stock to meet the minimum requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market; 

our ability to continue as a going concern and our
 need for and ability to obtain additional capital in the future; 

our ability to demonstrate
 the feasibility of and develop products and their underlying technologies; 

the impact of competitive
 or alternative products, technologies and pricing; 

our ability to attract
 and retain highly qualified personnel; 

our dependence on consultants
 to assist in the development of our technologies; 

our ability to manage the
 growth of our Company and to realize the benefits from any acquisitions or strategic alliances we may enter in the future; 

the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions
 including increases in prices caused by rising inflation; 

our dependence on the successful
 commercialization of the Evie Ring; 

our dependence on third
 parties to design, manufacture, market and distribute our products; 

the adequacy of protections
 afforded to us by the patents that we own and the success we may have in, and the cost to us of, maintaining, enforcing and defending
 those patents; 

our need to secure required
 FCC, FDA and other regulatory approvals from governmental authorities in the United States; 

the impact of healthcare
 regulations and reform measures; 

the accuracy of our estimates
 of market size for our products; 

our ability to implement
 and maintain effective control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures; and 

our success at managing
 the risks involved in the foregoing items. 

The
risks included above are not exhaustive. Other important risks and uncertainties are described in the Risk Factors and in Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation
to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of
new information, future developments or otherwise. 

Overview 

Movano
Inc., dba Movano Health, a Delaware corporation, is developing a platform to deliver purpose-driven healthcare solutions to bring medical-grade,
high-quality data to the forefront of consumer health devices. 

20 

Our
initial commercial product is the Evie Ring, a wearable designed specifically for women that was launched in November 2023. The Evie
Ring combines health and wellness metrics to give a full picture of one s health, which include resting heart rate, heart rate
variability HRV ), blood oxygen saturation SpO 2 ), respiration rate, skin temperature variability,
period and ovulation tracking, menstrual symptom tracking, activity profile, including steps, active minutes and calories burned, sleep
stages and duration, and mood tracking. The device provides women with continuous health data distilled down to simple, yet meaningful,
insights to help them make manageable lifestyle changes and take a more proactive approach that could mitigate the risks of chronic disease. 

We launched the Evie Ring as a general wellness
device without any FDA premarket clearances. Separately, we are planning to seek FDA clearances on our medical device, which will be sold
under the brand name EvieMED. We believe EvieMED will be one of the first patient wearables with FDA clearance on the entire system, both
hardware and software, differing from our competition which sometimes gets FDA clearance on an individual algorithm under Software
as a Medical Device guidance. In July 2023, we filed our first 510(k) submission to the FDA for the EvieMED Ring s pulse
oximeter to monitor pulse and SpO 2 data, following a successful pivotal hypoxia trial during the fourth quarter of 2022. With
progressive changes in the device and significant additional requirements from FDA since the initial submission, we opted to withdraw
the 2023 510(k). Armed with FDA s review of the initial 510(k) and results from a second pivotal hypoxia trial using the production
model ring completed in the first quarter of 2024, we re-submitted in April 2024. We believe that FDA clearance of these metrics, sold
via prescription under the brand name EvieMED, would foster clinical-level confidence in EvieMED s monitoring capabilities and could
make the device attractive to clinicians and to facilities engaged in clinical trials for at-home and/or long-term patient monitoring. 

In
addition to the Evie Ring and EvieMED Ring, we are developing one of the smallest patented and proprietary System-on-a-Chip SoC designed specifically for blood pressure or continuous glucose monitoring systems GCM ). We built the integrated sensor
from the ground up with multiple antennas and a variety of frequencies to achieve an unprecedented level of precision in health monitoring.
We are currently conducting clinical trials with the SoC and developing algorithms that, if successful, will enable us to develop wearables
that can monitor glucose non-invasively and blood pressure without a cuff. To that end, we are currently conducting a longitudinal study
(n=100) to program the effects of stress on blood pressure over time, with results pending. Our end goal is to bring a Class II FDA-cleared
device to the market that includes CGM and cuffless blood pressure monitoring capabilities. Over time, our technology could also enable
the measurement and continuous monitoring of other health data. 

On
April 28, 2021, the Company established Movano Ireland Limited, organized under the laws of Ireland, as a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company. 

Financial
Operations Overview 

We
are an early-stage technology company with a limited operating history. To date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and
financial resources into (i) the research and development of the products we are developing, including conducting clinical studies and
related sales, general and administrative costs, and (ii) the commercialization of our first commercial product, the Evie Ring. To date,
we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of our equity securities. 

We
have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our losses were 19.1 million and 23.3 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Substantially all our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection
with our research and development programs and from sales, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 11.3 million in available cash and cash equivalents. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On October 29, 2024, we completed a 1-for-15 reverse
stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each share of common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to October 29, 2024 were automatically reclassified and converted into one-fifteenth (1/15th) of a share
of common stock. The Reverse Stock Split affected all common stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder's percentage interest
in our equity, except to the extent that the Reverse Stock Split resulted in a stockholder of record owning a fractional share. Stockholders
of record who were otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share, instead automatically had their fractional shares rounded up to the
next whole share. No cash was issued for fractional shares as part of the Reverse Stock Split. 

The Reverse Stock Split did not change the
par value of the common stock or the authorized number of shares of common stock. Proportionate adjustments were made to the exercise
prices and the number of shares underlying our equity plans and grants thereunder, as applicable. The amount of undistributed shares
of Common Stock deemed to be covered by our effective registration statements on Forms S-3 and S-8 were proportionately reduced as of
the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split at the Reverse Stock Split Ratio. Additionally, proportionate adjustments were made to
the exercise prices and the number of shares underlying all outstanding warrants, as required by the terms of these securities. 

All
common share and per-share amounts in this Form 10-Q have been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our condensed consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated
financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenue and
expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

21 

There
have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, as compared to those disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K.

Revenue 

Revenue totaled 50,000 and 0 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The transfer of control of the Evie Ring Elements began in the first quarter of
2024, was completed in the second quarter of 2024, then re-started in the third quarter of 2024. 

Revenue
totaled 0.9 million and 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase of 0.9 million
was due to recognition of revenue upon the transfer of control of the Evie Ring Elements, which began in the first quarter of 2024. 

Cost
of revenue 

Cost of revenue totaled 0.8 million and
 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase of 0.8 million was due to the direct
costs of 0.2 million related to the transfer of control of the various Evie Ring Elements, 0.1 million for labor and related
stock-based compensation, and 0.5 million for inventory that was designated as scrap materials. 

Cost of revenue totaled 2.4 million and
 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase of 2.4 million was due to the direct
costs of 1.4 million related to the transfer of control of the various Evie Ring Elements, 0.3 million for labor and related
stock-based compensation, 0.1 million for order processing, shipping and fulfillment costs, and 0.6 million for inventory
that was designated as scrap materials. 

22 

Research
and Development 

Research and development expenses totaled 3.4 million
and 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease of 2.2 million was
due primarily to lower research and laboratory expenses and other professional fees. Research and development expenses for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 included expenses related to employee compensation of 1.8 million, other professional fees of 1.1 million,
research and laboratory expenses of 0.3 million, and other expenses of 0.2 million. Research and development expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2023 included expenses related to employee compensation of 1.6 million, other professional
fees of 1.6 million, research and laboratory expenses of 2.1 million, and other expenses of 0.3 million. 

Research
and development expenses totaled 9.2 million and 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. This decrease of 4.4 million was due primarily to lower research and laboratory expenses and other professional fees.
Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included expenses related to employee compensation
of 5.0 million, other professional fees of 2.4 million, research and laboratory expenses of 1.2 million, and other
expenses of 0.6 million. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included expenses
related to employee compensation of 5.0 million, other professional fees of 4.1 million, research and laboratory expenses

Sales,
General and Administrative 

Sales, general and administrative expenses totaled
 3.2 million and 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease of 0.2 million
was due primarily to lower headcount with respect to sales, general and administrative employees and decreased marketing costs, offset
by increased stock compensation expenses related to the issuance of new option grants. Sales, general and administrative expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 included expenses related to employee and board of director compensation of 1.8 million,
professional and consulting fees of 0.8 million, and other expenses of 0.6 million. Sales, general and administrative expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included expenses related to employee and board of director compensation of 1.7 million,
professional and consulting fees of 0.6 million, and other expenses of 1.1 million. 

Sales,
general and administrative expenses totaled 8.8 million and 10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. This decrease of 1.2 million was due primarily to lower Company headcount with respect to sales, general
and administrative employees and decreased marketing costs, offset by increased stock compensation expenses related to the issuance of
new option grants. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included expenses related
to employee and board of director compensation of 4.8 million, professional and consulting fees of 2.3 million, and other
expenses of 1.7 million. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included
expenses related to employee and board of director compensation of 5.1 million, professional and consulting fees of 1.8 million,
and other expenses of 3.1 million. 

Loss
from Operations 

Loss
from operations was 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 9.1 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Loss
from operations was 19.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 23.7 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Other
Income (Expense), Net 

Other
income (expense), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a net other income of 0.2 million as compared to a
net other income of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 0.1 million is attributable
to interest income on the additional funds that were received from the April 2024 Private Placement. 

Other income (expense), net for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was a net other income of 0.4 million as compared to a net other income of 0.3 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 0.1 million is attributable to interest income on the additional
funds that were received from the April 2024 Private Placement. 

23 

Net
Loss 

As
a result of the foregoing, net loss was 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 9.0 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

As
a result of the foregoing, net loss was 19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 23.3 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash
equivalents totaling 11.3 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 18.0 million of cash in our
operating activities. Our cash and cash equivalents are not expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months
after the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. In August 2022, we entered into an at-the-market issuance ATM to sell shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to 50.0 million, from time to time, through
an ATM equity offering program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 99,061 shares of common
stock through the ATM program for proceeds of approximately 0.6 million, net of commissions paid. Approximately 43.7 million
remained available on the ATM equity offering program at September 30, 2024. 

On April 2, 2024, the Company entered into a securities
purchase agreement for the private placement of an aggregate of 3,015,172 units with each unit consisting of (1) one share of the Company s
common stock or at the election of the purchaser a pre-funded warrant, and (2) one warrant to purchase one share of common stock. The
purchase price paid for each unit was 8.00. Certain directors and officers participated and purchased 19,168 units at an offering
price of 8.48 per unit. 

Each pre-funded warrant has an exercise price
of 0.015 per share, was immediately exercisable on the date of issuance and does not expire. Each warrant has an exercise price equal
to 6.11 per share, was exercisable immediately and expires on the fifth anniversary of the initial exercise date of the warrant. The
warrants issued to the Company s officers and directors have an exercise price equal to 6.60. 

The private placement transaction closed on April
5, 2024, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately 24.1 million, before deducting offering fees and expenses of approximately
 1.5 million. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We anticipate that
our expenses will increase substantially as we: 

advance the engineering
 design and development of the Evie Ring and other potential products; 

prepare applications required
 for marketing approval of the Evie Ring in the United States; 

develop our plans for manufacturing,
 distributing and marketing the Evie Ring and other potential products; and 

add operational, financial
 and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development, planned commercialization
 efforts and our operation as a public company. 

Until
we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our planned products, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public
or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements. Additional funds may not be available
when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce
the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts or it may become impossible
for us to remain in operation. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience
additional dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. To the extent that we raise additional funds
through collaborations and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or applications
or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions
are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. 

24 

These
circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year after the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Our condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue
as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to raise additional capital
as described above to support our future operations.

non-cash items, including stock-based compensation, totaling 3.0 million. 

The
 20.9 million used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to our
net loss of 23.3 million during the period. The net loss was offset by non-cash items, including stock-based compensation of 2.3 million
and depreciation and amortization of 0.1 million.

the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company used cash of 3,000 in investing activities, consisting of purchases of property

upon the exercise of common stock options.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item 3. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
are responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based
on our management s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer)
of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and our
principal financial officer have concluded that, due to the previously identified material weakness in our internal controls over financial
reporting that is described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, the end of
the period covered by this report. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. As previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, we identified one material weakness in our internal control
over financial reporting at December 31, 2023 related to ineffective design and operation of our financial close and reporting controls.
Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls over certain account reviews and analyses and certain information technology
general controls. Although we are making efforts to remediate these issues, these efforts may not be sufficient to avoid similar material
weaknesses in the future. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls
or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of a simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of control effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over
time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

We
are not currently a party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial
condition. We may, however, be subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business from time to time. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

We operate in a rapidly changing environment that
involves a number of risks that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, some of which are beyond
our control. In addition to the risk factor included below and other information set forth in this report, the risks and uncertainties
that we believe are most important for you to consider are discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K.
Except as disclosed below, we believe that there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Our failure to meet the continued listing
requirements of Nasdaq could result in a de-listing of our common stock. 

Our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq
Stock Market Nasdaq ). On November 14, 2023, we were notified by Nasdaq that because the closing bid price for the
Company s common stock listed on Nasdaq was below 1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, the Company no longer meets the minimum
bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2), requiring a minimum
bid price of 1.00 per share (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). On May 15, 2024, since the Company did not regain
compliance by May 13, 2024, the Company requested, and was granted, an additional 180 calendar days to regain compliance with Bid Price
Requirement expiring November 11, 2024. 

On October 29, 2024, the Company completed a 1-for-15 Reverse
Stock Split of its issued and outstanding common stock. On November 12, 2024, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that it had regained
compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Even though the Company is now in compliance with continued listing requirements of
Nasdaq, any future failure of the Company to satisfy such requirements could result in Nasdaq taking steps to delist the Company s
common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of the Company s common stock and would impair shareholders 
ability to sell or purchase the Company s common stock. In the event of a delisting, the Company would take actions to restore its
compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements, but the Company can provide no assurance that any such action taken by the Company
would allow its common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of the Company s common
stock, prevent the Company s common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance
with Nasdaq s listing requirements

delivered to the Company (as determined in accordance with the notice provisions hereof) is an Exercise Date. The
Holder shall not be required to deliver the original Warrant in order to effect an exercise hereunder, but shall do so reasonably shortly
thereafter. Execution and delivery of the Exercise Notice shall have the same effect as cancellation of the original Warrant and issuance
of a New Warrant evidencing the right to purchase the remaining number of Warrant Shares. 

(c) The
Holder may not exercise this Warrant at any time that Holder is unable to establish to the Company s reasonable satisfaction that
the exercise complies with an exemption from the registration provisions of Section5 of the Securities Act. 

2

to or upon the written order of the Holder and in such name or names as the Holder may designate a certificate for the Warrant Shares

to receive Warrant Shares, shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of such Warrant Shares as of the Exercise Date. 

8. Charges,
Taxes and Expenses. Issuance and delivery of certificates for shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant shall be made without
charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax, transfer agent fee or other incidental tax or expense in respect of the issuance of
such certificates, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not
be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the registration of any certificates for Warrant
Shares or Warrants in a name other than that of the Holder or an Affiliate thereof. The Holder shall be responsible for all other tax
liability that may arise as a result of holding or transferring this Warrant or receiving Warrant Shares upon exercise hereof.

indemnity (which shall not include a surety bond), if requested. Applicants for a New Warrant under such circumstances shall also comply
with such other reasonable regulations and procedures and pay such other reasonable third-party costs as the Company may prescribe. If
a New Warrant is requested as a result of a mutilation of this Warrant, then the Holder shall deliver such mutilated Warrant to the Company
as a condition precedent to the Company s obligation to issue the New Warrant. 

10. Reservation
of Warrant Shares. The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of the aggregate of its authorized
but unissued and otherwise unreserved Common Stock, solely for the purpose of enabling it to issue Warrant Shares upon exercise of this
Warrant as herein provided, the number of Warrant Shares which are then issuable and deliverable upon the exercise of this entire Warrant,
free from preemptive rights or any other contingent purchase rights of persons other than the Holder (taking into account the adjustments
and restrictions of Section 11 ). The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares so issuable and deliverable shall, upon issuance
and the payment of the applicable Exercise Price in accordance with the terms hereof, be duly and validly authorized, issued and fully
paid and nonassessable. The Company will take all such action as may be necessary to assure that such shares of Common Stock may be issued
as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of any securities exchange or automated
quotation system upon which the Common Shares may be listed. 

3 

11. Certain
Adjustments. The Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant are subject to adjustment from
time to time as set forth in this Section 11. 

(a) Stock
Dividends and Splits. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) pays a stock dividend on its Common Stock
or otherwise makes a distribution on any class of capital stock that is payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides its outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, or (iii) combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number
of shares, then in each such case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph shall become effective immediately
after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, and any adjustment pursuant
to clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. 

(b) Fundamental
Transactions. If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding (i) the Company effects any merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into another Person, in which the Company is not the survivor, (ii) the Company effects any sale of all or substantially all of
its assets or a majority of its Common Stock is acquired by a third party, in each case, in one or a series of related transactions, (iii)
any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which all or substantially all
of the holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property, or (iv) the Company
effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted
into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (other than as a result of a subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock
covered by Section 11(a) above) (in any such case, a Fundamental Transaction ), then the Holder shall
have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant (including payment of the Exercise Price), the same amount and kind
of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had
been, immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant Shares then issuable upon exercise in full
of this Warrant without regard to any limitations on exercise contained herein (the Alternate Consideration ).
The Company shall not effect any such Fundamental Transaction unless prior to or simultaneously with the consummation thereof, any successor
to the Company, surviving entity or the corporation purchasing or otherwise acquiring such assets or other appropriate corporation or
entity shall assume the obligation to deliver to the Holder, such Alternate Consideration as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions,
the Holder may be entitled to purchase and/or receive (as the case may be), and the other obligations under this Warrant. The provisions
of this paragraph (c) shall similarly apply to subsequent transactions analogous to a Fundamental Transaction. 

(c) Number
of Warrant Shares. Simultaneously with any adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section, the number
of Warrant Shares that may be purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be increased or decreased proportionately, so that after such
adjustment the aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder for the increased or decreased number of Warrant Shares shall be the same as
the aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment. 

4 

(d) Calculations. 
All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as applicable. The
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the Company,
and the sale or issuance of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock. 

(e) Notice
of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment pursuant to this Section 11, the Company at its expense will, at the
written request of the Holder, promptly compute such adjustment, in good faith, in accordance with the terms of this Warrant and prepare
a certificate setting forth such adjustment, including a statement of the adjusted Exercise Price and adjusted number or type of Warrant
Shares or other securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (as applicable), describing the transactions giving rise to such adjustments
and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. Upon written request, the Company will promptly deliver a copy of
each such certificate to the Holder and to the Company s transfer agent. 

(f) Notice
of Corporate Events. If, while this Warrant is outstanding, the Company (i) declares a dividend or any other distribution of cash,
securities or other property in respect of its Common Stock, including, without limitation, any granting of rights or warrants to subscribe
for or purchase any capital stock of the Company, (ii) authorizes or approves, enters into any agreement contemplating or solicits stockholder
approval for any Fundamental Transaction or (iii) authorizes the voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the
Company, then, except if such notice and the contents thereof shall be deemed to constitute material non-public information, the Company
shall deliver to the Holder a notice describing the material terms and conditions of such transaction at least ten (10) Trading Days prior
to the applicable record or effective date on which a Person would need to hold Common Stock in order to participate in or vote with respect
to such transaction, and the Company will take all steps reasonably necessary in order to insure that the Holder is given the practical
opportunity to exercise this Warrant prior to such time so as to participate in or vote with respect to such transaction; provided,
however, that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required
to be described in such notice. 

12. Payment
of Exercise Price. The Holder shall pay the Exercise Price in immediately available funds; provided, however, that if at the
time of exercise hereof there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not available
for the resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder, then Holder may satisfy its obligation to pay the Exercise Price through a cashless
exercise , in which event the Company shall issue to the Holder the number of Warrant Shares determined as follows: 

X = Y [(A-B)/A] 

where: 

X = the number of Warrant Shares to be
issued to the Holder. 

Y = the total number of Warrant Shares
with respect to which this Warrant is being exercised. 

A = the average of the Closing Sale Prices
of the shares of Common Stock for the five Trading Days ending on the date immediately preceding the Exercise Date. 

B = the Exercise Price then in effect
for the applicable Warrant Shares at the time of such exercise. 

5
