The Company s Level 2 assets and liabilities consisted of:

 On August 2, 2024, A F, as parent and a guarantor, A F Management, as lead borrower, and certain of A F s direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, as additional borrowers and guarantors, entered into the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment ), together with the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the lenders. The Second Amendment amends the existing Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 29, 2021 (the ABL Credit Agreement ), which provided for a million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The Company incurred customary fees and expenses in connection with the entry into the Second Amendment. 
 
 The Second Amendment amended the ABL Credit Agreement to, among other things: 
 increase the aggregate commitments thereunder to million; 
 establish a 100 million sub-facility for the benefit of Abfico Netherlands Distribution B.V. Abfico and AFH Stores UK Limited AFH UK that is (i) secured by a first priority security interest in all assets (subject to specified exclusions) of each of Abfico and AFH UK, (ii) guaranteed by A F and certain of its domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, and (iii) subject to a borrowing base as described therein;

 from to when average availability is less than 50 of the Loan Cap. 
 
 The ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base, consisting primarily of inventory located in the U.S., the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, with a letter of credit sub-limit of million, a swing line loan sub-limit of million, and an accordion feature allowing A F to increase the revolving commitment by up to million subject to specified conditions. The ABL Facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. 
 
 As of November 2, 2024, availability under the ABL Facility was million, net of million in outstanding stand-by letters of credit. As the Company must maintain excess availability equal to the greater of 10 of the loan cap or 36 million under the ABL Facility, borrowing capacity available to the Company under the ABL Facility was million as of November 2, 2024. 
 
 Representations, warranties and covenants

The group comprised of the Company s (i) Chief Executive Officer and (ii) Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer functioned as the Company s CODM as of November 2, 2024. The Company s CODM manages business operations and evaluates the performance of each segment based on the net sales and operating income (loss) of the segment. 
 
 Net sales by segment are presented by attributing revenues to a physical store location or geographical region that fulfills the order. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributed to the segment. Corporate/other expenses include expenses incurred that are not directly attributed to a reportable segment and primarily relate to corporate or global functions such as design, sourcing, brand management, corporate strategy, information technology, finance, treasury, legal, human resources, and other corporate support services, as well as certain globally managed components of the planning, merchandising, and marketing functions. 
 
 The Company reports inventories by segment as that information is used by the CODM in determining allocation of resources to the segments. The Company does not report its other assets by segment as that information is not used by the CODM in assessing segment performance or allocating resources.

 Seasonality 
 
 Historically, the Company s operations have been seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: the spring season, which includes the first and second fiscal quarters Spring ), and the fall season, which includes the third and fourth fiscal quarters Fall ). Due to the seasonal nature of the retail apparel industry, the results of operations for any current period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year and the Company could have significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts. The Company historically experiences its greatest sales activity during the Fall season due to back-to-school and holiday sales periods, respectively. 

CURRENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK 
 
 Focus areas for fiscal 2024 
 
 In June of Fiscal 2022, we announced our 2025 Always Forward Plan, which outlines our long-term strategy and goals, including growing shareholder value. The 2025 Always Forward Plan is anchored on our strategic growth principles, which are to: 
 Execute focused growth plans; 
 Accelerate an enterprise-wide digital revolution; and 
 Operate with financial discipline. 
 
 The 2025 Always Forward Plan growth principles serve as a framework for the Company achieving sustainable and profitable growth and profitability in Fiscal 2024. Below are some additional details specific to Fiscal 2024 objectives within the 2025 Always Forward Plan: 
 
 Execute focused growth plans by: 
 driving sales growth across regions and brands primarily through marketing and store investment; 
 using our playbooks globally to align the brands products, voices, and experiences with customers, both digitally and in-store; and 
 using testing and chase strategies to deliver compelling assortments and product collections across genders. 
 
 Accelerate an enterprise-wide digital revolution to improve the customer and associate experience by: 
 continuing to progress on our multi-year enterprise resource planning ERP transformation and cloud migration journey; and 
 investing in digital and technology to improve experiences across key parts of the customer journey while delivering a consistent omnichannel experience. 
 
 Operate with financial discipline by: 
 actively managing inventory levels and positioning Abercrombie brands and Hollister brands to chase inventory as appropriate throughout the year; and 
 funding our growth strategies while properly balancing investments, impacts of inflation and efficiency efforts.

Current macroeconomic conditions and impact of inflation 
 
 Macroeconomic conditions, that include inflation, a volatile interest rate environment, the geopolitical landscape, global political uncertainty, including as a result of the 2024 U.S. presidential and congressional elections, uncertainty regarding significant changes in legislation, regulations, and tariffs, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and evolving habits in consumer discretionary spending continue to impact the global economy. In periods of perceived or actual unfavorable economic conditions, consumers may reallocate available discretionary spending or determine that they have fewer funds available for discretionary spending, which may adversely impact demand for our products. In addition, while cotton and raw material costs stabilized since the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, freight costs have been increasing since the start of the second quarter of Fiscal 2024. Continued inflationary pressures and pricing volatility could further impact expenses and have a long-term impact on the Company because increasing costs may impact its ability to maintain satisfactory margins. 
 
 Global events and supply chain disruptions 
 
 As a global multi-brand omnichannel specialty retailer, with operations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, among other regions, management is mindful of macroeconomic risks, global challenges and the changing global geopolitical environment. The global supply chain also continues to be negatively impacted by various factors, including disruptions in major maritime routes, port congestion, higher operational costs, and increased competition for supply chain availability due to uncertainty regarding potential tariffs. The Company has taken certain mitigating actions in response to these disruptions, including increasing air freight usage where appropriate and prioritizing critical orders earlier to allow for longer lead times. Further mitigating actions may be needed, particularly if there is prolonged port congestion or transportation delays, and could result in higher freight costs in the near-term and beyond. 
 
 Management continues to monitor global events and assess the potential impacts that these and similar events may have on the business in future periods. Although management also develops and updates contingency plans to assist in mitigating potential impacts, it is possible that the Company s preparations for such events are not adequate to mitigate their impact, and that these events could further adversely affect its business and results of operations. 
 
 Global store network optimization 
 
 The Company has a goal of finding the right size, right location and right economics for omni-enabled stores that cater to local customers. The Company continues to use data to inform its focus on aligning store square footage with digital penetration, and has delivered new store experiences across brands during Fiscal 2024. Through the end of the third fiscal quarter, the Company opened 39 new stores, remodeled 30 stores and right-sized eight stores while closing 31 stores. As part of this focus, the Company s store investment plan includes delivering approximately 20 net store openings during Fiscal 2024 consisting of opening approximately 60 new stores, while closing approximately 40 stores, pending negotiations with our landlord partners. Additionally, the Company expects approximately 60 remodels and rightsizes, during Fiscal 2024, pending negotiations with our landlord partners. 
 
 Future closures could be completed through natural lease expirations, while certain other leases include early termination options that can be exercised under specific conditions. The Company may also elect to exit or modify other leases, and could incur charges related to these actions. 
 
 Pillar Two Model Rules 
 
 In 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD released Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion model rules Pillar Two Rules ), designed to ensure large corporations are taxed at a minimum rate of 15 in all countries of operation. Although the U.S. has not yet enacted legislation implementing Pillar Two Rules, other countries where the Company does business, including the U.K. and Germany, have enacted legislation implementing Pillar Two Rules, which are effective from January 1, 2024. The implementation of the Pillar Two Rules in each jurisdiction in which it operates did not have a material impact on the Company s effective tax rate. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact as additional jurisdictions implement legislation and provide further guidance. 
 
 For a discussion of material risks that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors on the Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K.

Table of Contents 

 For the third quarter of Fiscal 2024, net sales increased 14 as compared to the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a high-single digit growth in unit volume from traffic growth in comparable company owned and operated stores and digital channels. Mid-single digit increase in average unit retail AUR from lower promotional activity and category mix into higher ticket items also contributed to the increase in net sales. The increase was partially offset by approximately 10 million due to the timing of sales volume based on the impact of the calendar shift in fiscal 2024 due to the 53rd selling week in fiscal 2023. The year-over-year increase in net sales reflects positive comparable sales of 16 , as compared to the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. 
 Net sales growth in the Americas region of 14 . The increase was attributable to both higher AUR from lower promotional activity and category mix into higher ticket items and direct channel unit volume growth from increased traffic and transactions in company owned and operated stores and digital channels. 
 Net sales growth in the EMEA region of 15 . The increase was attributable to both higher AUR from lower promotional activity and category mix into higher ticket items and unit volume growth from increased traffic and transactions in company owned and operated stores and digital channels. 
 In the APAC region net sales grew 32 and 16 on a comparable sales basis. In the third quarter, APAC net sales growth had an outsized benefit relative to total company from the calendar shift of the 53rd selling week. This third quarter benefit will be offset in the fourth quarter. Comparable sales growth led by high unit sales across company owned and operated stores and digital channels. 
 
 For the year-to-date period of Fiscal 2024, net sales increased 19 , as compared to the year-to-date period of Fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a double-digit increase in AUR from lower promotional activity and category mix into higher ticket items. Mid-single digit growth in unit volume also contributed to the increase in net sales, following increases in traffic and transactions in company owned and operated channels. Additionally, there was a benefit of approximately 30 million due to the timing of sales volume based on the impact of the calendar shift in Fiscal 2024 due to the 53rd selling week in Fiscal 2023. The year-over-year increase in net sales reflects positive comparable sales of 18 , as compared to the year-to-date period of Fiscal 2023. 
 Net sales growth in the Americas region of 20 and 18 on a comparable basis. The increase was attributable to a higher AUR from lower promotional activity and category mix into higher ticket items. Growth in unit volume as a result of increased traffic and transactions in company owned and operated stores and digital channels also contributed to the increase in net sales. 
 Net sales growth in the EMEA region of 17 on both a reported and comparable sales basis. The increase was attributable to a higher AUR from lower promotional activity and category mix into higher ticket items. Growth in unit volume as a result of increased traffic and transactions in company owned and operated stores and digital channels contributed to the increase in net sales. 
 In the APAC region net sales grew 15 and 20 on a comparable sales basis. Comparable sales growth percentage is higher than net sales growth percentage, as comparable sales excludes the impact of store closures during the period and the effects of foreign currency, both of which had negative impacts on net sales growth. 
 
 The Company s net sales by brand for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 were as follows:

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 The Company s capital allocation strategy and priorities are reviewed by the Board of Directors quarterly, considering both liquidity and valuation factors. The Company believes that it will have adequate liquidity to fund operating activities for the next twelve months. The Company monitors market conditions and may in the future determine whether and when to repurchase shares of its Common Stock. For a discussion of the Company s share repurchase activity, please see below under Share repurchases and dividends . 
 
 Primary sources and uses of cash 
 
 The Company s business has two principal selling seasons: Spring and Fall, The Company generally experiences its greatest sales activity during the Fall season, due to the back-to-school and holiday sales periods. The Company relies on excess operating cash flows, which are largely generated in Fall, to fund operations throughout the year and to reinvest in the business to support future growth. The Company also has the ABL Facility available as a source of additional funding, which is described further below under Credit facility . 
 
 Over the next twelve months, the Company expects its primary cash requirements to be directed towards prioritizing investments in the business and continuing to fund operating activities, including the acquisition of inventory, obligations related to compensation, marketing, data and technology, leases and any lease buyouts or modifications it may exercise, taxes and other operating activities. In addition, management continuously evaluates potential opportunities to strategically deploy excess cash and/or deleverage the balance sheet, in consideration of various factors, such as market and business conditions, and the Company s ability to accelerate investments in the business. Such opportunities may include, but are not limited to, share repurchases. 
 
 When evaluating opportunities for investments in the business, management considers alignment with initiatives that position the business for sustainable long-term growth and with the Company s strategic pillars as described within Part I, Item 1. Business - STRATEGY AND KEY BUSINESS PRIORITIES included on the Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K, including being opportunistic regarding growth opportunities. Examples of potential investment opportunities include, but are not limited to, new store experiences, and investments in the Company s digital and omnichannel initiatives. Historically, the Company has utilized free cash flow generated from operations to fund any discretionary capital expenditures, which have been prioritized towards new store experiences, as well as digital and omnichannel investments, and information technology. For the year-to-date period ended November 2, 2024, the Company invested 132.0 million towards capital expenditures. Total capital expenditures for Fiscal 2024 are expected to be approximately 170 million. 
 
 The Company measures liquidity using total cash and cash equivalents and incremental borrowing available under the ABL Facility. As of November 2, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 683.1 million and total liquidity of approximately 1.1 billion, compared with cash and cash equivalents of 900.9 million and total liquidity of approximately 1.2 billion at the beginning of Fiscal 2024. 
 
 Share repurchases and dividends 
 
 In November 2021, the Board of Directors approved a 500 million share repurchase authorization, replacing the prior 2021 share repurchase authorization of 10.0 million shares, which had approximately 3.9 million shares remaining available. During the year-to-date period ended November 2, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 0.9 million shares of its Common Stock pursuant to this share repurchase authorization for approximately 129.8 million. As of November 2, 2024 t he Company had 102 million in share repurchases remaining under the authorization approved in November 2021. 
 
 Historically, the Company has repurchased shares of its Common Stock from time to time, which repurchases are dependent on excess liquidity, market conditions and business conditions, with the objectives of returning excess cash to shareholders and offsetting dilution from issuances of Common Stock associated with the exercise of employee stock appreciation rights and the vesting of restricted stock units. Shares may be repurchased in the open market, including pursuant to trading plans established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), through privately negotiated transactions or other transactions or by a combination of such methods. 
 
 In May 2020, the Company suspended its dividend program. The Company may in the future review its dividend program to determine, in light of facts and circumstances at that time, whether and when to reinstate. Any dividends are declared at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors reviews and establishes a dividend amount, if at all, based on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, current and projected cash flows, business prospects and other factors, including any restrictions under the Company s agreements related to the ABL Facility. There can be no assurance that the Company will declare and pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.

 Income taxes 
 
 The Company s earnings and profits from its foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated to the U.S. without incurring additional federal income tax. The Company determined that the balance of the Company s undistributed earnings and profits from its foreign subsidiaries as of February 2, 2019 are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., and if these funds were to be repatriated to the U.S., the Company would expect to incur an insignificant amount of state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. The Company accrues for both state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes with respect to earnings and profits earned after February 2, 2019, in such a manner that these funds could be repatriated without incurring additional tax expense. As of November 2, 2024, 262.8 million of the Company s 683.1 million of cash and equivalents were held by foreign affiliates.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes discussion of certain financial measures calculated and presented on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company believes that each of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is useful to investors as it provides a meaningful basis to evaluate the Company s operating performance excluding the effect of certain items that the Company believes may not reflect its future operating outlook, such as certain asset impairment charges, thereby supplementing investors understanding of comparability of operations across periods. Management used these non-GAAP financial measures during the periods presented to assess the Company s performance and to develop expectations for future operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be used as a supplement to, and not as an alternative to, the Company s GAAP financial results, and may not be calculated in the same manner as similar measures presented by other companies. 
 
 Comparable sales 
 
 The Company provides comparable sales, defined as the year-over-year percentage change in the aggregate of (1) net sales for stores that have been open as the same brand at least one year and square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20 within the past year, with the prior year s net sales converted at the current year s foreign currency exchange rates to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and (2) digital net sales with the prior year s net sales converted at the current year s foreign currency exchange rates to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Comparable sales excludes revenue other than store and digital sales. Management uses comparable sales to understand the drivers of year-over-year changes in net sales and believes that comparable sales can be a useful metric as it can assist investors in distinguishing the portion of the Company s revenue attributable to existing locations from the portion attributable to the opening or closing of stores. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is change in net sales. 
 
 Excluded items 
 
 The following financial measures are disclosed on a GAAP and on an adjusted non-GAAP basis excluding the following items, as applicable: 
 Financial measures (1) 
 Excluded items Operating income Asset impairment charges Income tax expense (2) 
 Tax effect of pre-tax excluded items Net income and net income per share attributable to A F (2)

 Financial information on a constant currency basis 
 
 The Company provides certain financial information on a constant currency basis to enhance investors understanding of underlying business trends and operating performance by removing the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management also uses financial information on a constant currency basis to award employee performance-based compensation. The effect from foreign currency exchange rates, calculated on a constant currency basis, is determined by applying the current period s foreign currency exchange rates to the prior year s results and is net of the year-over-year impact from hedging. The per diluted share effect from foreign currency exchange rates is calculated using a 26 effective tax rate.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 The Company provides EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures used by the Company's executive management to assess the Company's performance.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
 
 The Company maintains its cash equivalents in financial instruments, primarily time deposits and money market funds, with original maturities of three months or less. Recently the Company invested in short-term marketable securities with maturities less than twelve months. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, changes in interest rates are not expected to materially affect the fair value of these financial instruments. 
 
 The Rabbi Trust includes amounts to meet funding obligations to participants in the Abercrombie Fitch Co. Nonqualified Savings and Supplemental Retirement Plan I, the Abercrombie Fitch Co. Nonqualified Savings and Supplemental Retirement Plan II, and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. The Rabbi Trust assets primarily consist of trust-owned life insurance policies, which are recorded at cash surrender value. The change in cash surrender value resulted in realized gains of 0.3 million and 0.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively and 1.0 million and 1.6 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. The realized gains were recorded in interest (income) expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
 
 The Rabbi Trust assets were included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of November 2, 2024 and February 3, 2024 and are restricted in their use as noted above. 
 
 INTEREST RATE RISK 
 
 Prior to July 2, 2020, the Company s exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates related primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense from fluctuations in the LIBO rate, or an alternate base rate associated with the Company s former term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility. On July 2, 2020, the Company issued the Senior Secured Notes and repaid all outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility, thereby eliminating any then-existing cash flow market risk due to changes in interest rates. On July 15, 2024, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding Senior Secured Notes, thereby eliminating that interest rate risk. This analysis for Fiscal 2024 may differ from the actual results due to potential changes in gross borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility and potential changes in interest rate terms and limitations described within the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
 
 In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBO rate) announced it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBO rate after 2021. Certain publications of the LIBO rate were phased out at the end of 2021 and all LIBO rate publications ceased after June 30, 2023. On March 15, 2023, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the First Amendment to eliminate LIBO rate based loans and to use the current market definitions with respect to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, as well as to make other conforming changes. 
 
 FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK 
 
 A F s international subsidiaries generally operate with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Since the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the Company must translate all components of these financial statements from functional currencies into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of the reporting period. The fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affects the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. The potential impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increases as international operations relative to domestic operations increase. 
 
 A F and its subsidiaries have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with foreign currency transactions and forecasted foreign currency transactions, including the purchase of inventory between subsidiaries and foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities. The Company has established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency exchange forward contracts to partially offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency transactions and forecasted transactions. Under this program, increases or decreases in foreign currency exchange rate exposures are partially offset by gains or losses on foreign currency exchange forward contracts, to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange gains or losses. The Company does not use forward contracts to engage in currency speculation. Outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts are recorded at fair value at the end of each fiscal period. 
 
 Foreign currency exchange forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of November 2, 2024, the Company assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of a hypothetical 10 devaluation of the U.S. dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract. Such a hypothetical devaluation would decrease derivative contract fair values by approximately 15.7 million. As the Company s foreign currency exchange forward contracts are primarily designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, the hypothetical change in fair values would be expected to be largely offset by the net change in fair values of the underlying hedged items. Refer to Note 12, DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS , for the fair value of any outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts included in other current assets and accrued expenses as of November 2, 2024 and February 3, 2024.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 A F maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that A F files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to A F s management, including A F s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. 
 
 A F s management, including the Chief Executive Officer of A F (who serves as Principal Executive Officer of A F) and the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of A F (who serves as Principal Financial Officer of A F), evaluated the effectiveness of A F s design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended November 2, 2024. The Chief Executive Officer of A F (in such individual s capacity as the Principal Executive Officer of A F) and the Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of A F (in such individual s capacity as the Principal Financial Officer of A F) concluded that A F s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of November 2, 2024. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 There were no changes in A F s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended November 2, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, A F s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Company and its affiliates are defendants in lawsuits and other adversary proceedings that may range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits. The Company s legal costs incurred in connection with the resolution of claims and lawsuits are generally expensed as incurred, and the Company establishes estimated liabilities for the outcome of litigation where losses are deemed probable and the amount of loss, or range of loss, is reasonably estimable. The Company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, and it is able to determine such estimates. The Company s accrued charges for certain legal contingencies are classified within accrued expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 1. Financial Statements (Unaudited) , of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on currently available information, the Company cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrued charges for legal contingencies. In addition, the Company has not established accruals for certain claims and legal proceedings pending against the Company where it is not possible to reasonably estimate the outcome or potential liability, and the Company cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for these legal matters. Actual liabilities may differ from the amounts recorded, due to uncertainties regarding final settlement agreement negotiations and the terms of any approval by the courts, and there can be no assurance that the final resolution of legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company s assessment of the current exposure could change in the event of the discovery of additional facts. 
 
 In addition, pursuant to Item 103(c)(3)(iii) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, the Company is required to disclose certain information about environmental proceedings to which a governmental authority is a party if the Company reasonably believes such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, above a stated threshold. The Company has elected to apply a threshold of 1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Other than identified below, the Company s risk factors as of November 2, 2024 have not changed materially from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Misconduct or illegal activities by our current and former associates, directors, advisers, third-party service providers, or others affiliated, or perceived to be affiliated, with the Company could subject to us to reputational harm, regulatory scrutiny or inquiries, or legal liability . 
 
 There is a risk that current or former associates, executives, directors, advisers or third party-service providers of the Company, or others who are actually or perceived to be affiliated with the Company, could engage, deliberately or recklessly, in misconduct or fraud that creates legal exposure for the Company and adversely affects our business. If such individuals were to engage, or be accused of engaging in, illegal or suspicious activities, sexual misconduct or harassment, racial or gender discrimination, improper use or disclosure of confidential information, fraud, payment or solicitation of bribes, or any other type of similar misconduct or violation of other laws and regulations, during their employment or service with the Company, we could suffer serious harm to our brand, reputation, be subject to penalties or sanctions, suffer serious harm to our financial position and current and future business relationships, and face potentially significant litigation or investigations. 
 
 In particular, Michael Jeffries, who served as chief executive officer of the Company from 1992 to 2014, has been accused of sexual abuse and exploitation, which accusations include claims relating to behavior that is alleged to have occurred during his prior tenure with the Company. Criminal charges have been filed against Mr. Jeffries, and there is a pending civil suit against Mr. Jeffries and the Company that relates to this alleged behavior. Although we believe the claims against the Company are without merit, the allegations against this former executive, as well as the claims brought against the Company, have resulted in negative media attention and may result in additional litigation or may result in other adverse consequences to our reputation, brand, and business. In addition, in early March 2024, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that Mr. Jeffries was entitled to advancement by the Company of his defense costs for the civil litigation. Mr. Jeffries is now seeking advancement of defense costs for his criminal prosecution, which the Company intends to oppose.

For the purpose of this Agreement, Base Salary shall mean the Executive s annual rate of base salary as in effect on the applicable date provided, however, that if the Executive s employment with the Company is being terminated by the Executive for Good Reason as a result of a reduction in the Executive s Base Salary, then Base Salary shall, for purposes of the definition of Good Reason and Section 3 of this Agreement, constitute the Executive s Base Salary as in effect prior to such reduction.
