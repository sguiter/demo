Diluted income per share is computed by dividing net income available to shareholders by our weighted average shares outstanding during the period including potential dilutive ordinary shares.

 million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to tax expense of million and million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense was lower in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same three month period in 2023 due to a release of a valuation allowance of million in the third quarter of 2024. Income tax expense was higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to increased earnings before taxes. In addition, income tax expense during the nine months ended 2023 had been lowered by million due to the release of valuation allowances and the recognition of a benefit from previously uncertain tax positions. The 2023 benefits were offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance of approximately million related to the sale of Blue Chip Swap securities in Argentina. We calculate income tax provision using the estimated annual effective tax rate method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 740 - Income Taxes. 
 
 The relationship between our pre-tax income or loss and our income tax provision or benefit varies from period to period due to various factors which include changes in total pre-tax income or loss, the jurisdictions in which our income is earned, the tax laws in those jurisdictions and in our operating structure. We provide for income taxes based on the laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted, or in which we or our subsidiaries are considered residents for income tax purposes. Our income tax provisions are primarily driven by income in certain jurisdictions and withholding taxes on intercompany and third-party transactions that do not directly correlate to ordinary income or loss. Certain charges and impairments recognized do not result in significant tax benefit as a result of being attributed to a non-income tax jurisdiction or our inability to forecast realization of the tax benefit of such losses. This is partially offset by the utilization of previously unbenefited deferred tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards. 
 
 In December 2023, Ireland enacted tax legislation that models the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development reform plans focused on global profit allocation and implementing a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 for large multinational corporations on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, known as Pillar Two. This is not expected to materially increase the taxes we owe. 
 
 We routinely undergo tax examination in various jurisdictions. We cannot predict the timing or outcome regarding resolution of these tax examinations or if they will have a material impact on our financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, we anticipate that it is reasonably possible that our uncertain tax positions of million, including interest and penalties offset by net operating losses and other tax attributes if settled, may decrease by up to million in the next twelve months due to expiration of statutes of limitations, settlements and/or conclusions of tax examinations.

The agreement was modified in the second quarter of 2024 to reduce the notional balance, and then terminated in the third quarter of 2024, extinguishing the remaining notional balance.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 As used in this item, Weatherford , the Company, we, us and our refer to Weatherford International plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of Ireland, and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 1. Financial Statements. Our discussion includes various forward-looking statements about our markets, the demand for our products and services and our future results. These statements include assumptions, certain risks and uncertainties. For information about these assumptions, risks and uncertainties, refer to the section Forward-Looking Statements and the section PART II - OTHER INFORMATION - Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Business 
 
 Weatherford is a leading global energy services company providing equipment and services used in the drilling, evaluation, well construction, completion, production, intervention and responsible abandonment of wells in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry as well as new energy platforms. 
 
 We conduct business in approximately 75 countries, answering the challenges of the energy industry with 330 operating locations including manufacturing, research and development, service, and training facilities. Our operational performance is reviewed and managed across the life cycle of the wellbore, and we report in three segments (1) Drilling and Evaluation, (2) Well Construction and Completions, and (3) Production and Intervention. 
 
 Drilling and Evaluation DRE offers a suite of services including managed pressure drilling, drilling services, wireline and drilling fluids. DRE offerings range from early well planning to reservoir management through innovative tools and expert engineering to optimize reservoir access and productivity. 
 
 Well Construction and Completions WCC offers products and services for well integrity assurance across the full life cycle of the well. The primary offerings are tubular running services, cementation products, completions, liner hangers and well services. WCC deploys conventional to advanced technologies, providing safe and efficient services in any environment during the well construction phase. 
 
 Production and Intervention PRI offers a suite of reservoir stimulation designs, and engineering capabilities that isolate zones and unlock reserves in conventional and unconventional wells, deep water, and aging reservoirs. The primary offerings are intervention services drilling tools, artificial lift, digital solutions, sub-sea intervention and pressure pumping services in select markets. 

Industry Trends 
 
 Demand for our industry s products and services is driven by many factors, including commodity prices, the number of oil and gas rigs and wells drilled, depth and drilling conditions of wells, number of well completions, age of existing wells, reservoir depletion, regulatory environment, and the level of workover activity worldwide. 
 
 Lower oil and natural gas prices and lower rig count generally correlate to lower exploration and production spending, and higher oil and natural gas prices and higher rig count generally correlate to higher exploration and production spending. Therefore, our financial results are significantly affected by oil and natural gas prices as well as rig counts.

Russia Ukraine Conflict 
 
 In February 2022, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine Russia Ukraine Conflict began and in response we evaluated, and continue to evaluate, our operations, with the priority being centered on the safety and well-being of our employees in the impacted regions, as well as operating in full compliance with applicable international laws and sanctions. 
 
 Revenues in Russia were approximately 6 and 5 of our total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6 of our total revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our Russia operations included 94 million in cash, 98 million in other current assets, 69 million in property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets, and 51 million in liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, our Russia operations included 62 million in cash, 94 million in other current assets, 76 million in property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets, and 62 million in liabilities. 
 
 We continue to closely monitor and evaluate the developments in Russia as well as any changes in international laws and sanctions. We believe that operational complexity will increase over time and therefore continually evaluate these potential impacts on our business. As such, we continue to actively evaluate various options, strategies and contingencies with respect to our business in Russia, including, but not limited to: 
 
 continuing the business in compliance with applicable laws and sanctions; 
 evaluating the continued use or change in products, equipment and service offerings we currently provide in 
 Russia; 
 curtailing or winding down our activities over time; 
 potentially divesting some or all of our assets or businesses in Russia, which could include the option of re-entering the country if and when sanctions or applicable laws would allow for the same; and 
 potential nationalization of the business. 
 
 Conflicts in the Middle East 
 
 We are monitoring the recent escalation of conflicts in the Middle East as there is a renewed and heightened risk of operational disruption, including personnel movement, supply chain and logistics.

Consolidated Statements of Operations - Operating Summary 
 
 Revenues of 1.4 billion and 4.2 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 7 and 11 compared to 1.3 billion and 3.8 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Year-over-year in the third quarter, product revenues increased 6 and service revenues increased 8 . WCC and DRE contributed 52 and 49 of the increase in revenues, respectively, with PRI essentially flat. Year-over-year in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, product revenues increased 10 and service revenues 11 . WCC, DRE, and PRI contributed 38 , 33 , and 1 of the increase in revenues, respectively. The remaining revenue increase year-over-year year-to-date was due to higher activity in integrated services and projects. 
 
 Geographically, the year-over-year third quarter revenue growth was led by improvements in the Middle East/North Africa/Asia, Europe/Sub-Sahara Africa/Russia and Latin America regions, which contributed to 74 , 28 and 1 of the increase, respectively, partly offset by a revenue decline in North America. Year-over-year in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue growth was led by improvements in the Middle East/North Africa/Asia, Europe/Sub-Sahara Africa/Russia, and Latin America regions, which contributed to 78 , 21 and 9 of the increase, respectively, partly offset by a revenue decline in North America. 
 
 Operating income of 243 million and 740 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 11 and 23 compared to 218 million and 604 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily driven by improved operational efficiencies from increased resource utilization in addition to gains on sales of used rental equipment. Cost of products and services of 917 million and 2.7 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 7 and 8 compared to 859 million and 2.5 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our cost of products and services as a percentage of revenues was 65 in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 65 and 66 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Average oil prices in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 7 for West Texas Intermediate crude oil and 8 for Brent North Sea crude oil, and in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1 for both West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Brent North Sea crude oil compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. Average Henry Hub natural gas prices in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 19 and in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 15 , compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. Global rig counts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 3 and 5 compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively, driven by a decrease in North America. The year-over-year decrease in both the Henry Hub natural gas prices and North America rig count reflects the lower market demand and oversupply of natural gas in the region. 
 
 Selling, general, administrative and research and development costs of 236 million and 719 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 2 and increased 5 compared to 241 million and 682 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The third quarter decrease year-over-year was primarily due to a decrease in employee incentive programs. The year-to-date increase year-over-year primarily reflects an increase in overhead to support organization growth and an increase in research and development on newer technologies. Selling, general, administrative and research and development costs as a percentage of revenues was 17 in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 18 in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other charges (credits) in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 13 million and 21 million in net charges, respectively, and primarily includes fees to third-party financial institutions to facilitate loans between those financial institutions and our largest customer in Mexico, who in turn paid certain of our outstanding receivables. Other charges (credits) in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 5 million and 9 million in net credits, respectively.

Table of Contents 

 Interest expense of 37 million and 121 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 45 million and 139 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, decreased primarily due to the reduction in our outstanding long-term debt. As of September 30, 2024, we have fully repaid our outstanding 2028 Senior Secured Notes. See Note 6 Borrowings and Other Debt Obligations to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Interest income was 13 million and 44 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 15 million and 47 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Loss on Blue Chip Swap Securities 
 
 An indirect foreign exchange mechanism known as the Blue Chip Swap BCS allows entities to remit U.S. dollars from operations in Argentina. No BCS transactions were executed during the third quarter of 2024 or 2023. During the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, we entered into a series of BCS securities transactions that resulted in a Loss on Blue Chip Swap Securities of 10 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 57 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. See Note 12 Blue Chip Swap Securities - Argentina to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 

Other Expense, Net 
 
 Other expense, net was 41 million and 83 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 24 million and 98 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Other expense, net primarily represents foreign exchange losses in countries with no or limited markets to hedge, letter of credit fees and other financing charges, including when applicable, bond redemption premiums partially offset by certain investment gains and losses. When economically advantageous, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risk of future cash flows denominated in a foreign currency. 

Income Taxes 
 
 We provide for income taxes based on the laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted, or in which we or our subsidiaries are considered residents for income tax purposes. The relationship between our pre-tax income or loss from continuing operations and our income tax benefit or provision varies from period to period as a result of various factors, which include changes in total pre-tax income or loss, the jurisdictions in which our income is earned, the tax laws in those jurisdictions, the impacts of tax planning activities and the resolution of tax audits. Our effective rate differs from the Irish statutory tax rate as the majority of our operations are taxed in jurisdictions with different tax rates. In addition, certain charges do not result in significant tax benefit as a result of being attributed to a non-income tax jurisdiction or our inability to forecast realization of the tax benefit of such losses. Charges can be partially offset by the utilization of previously unbenefited deferred tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards. Please see Note 10 Income Taxes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.

 Of the third quarter year-over-year revenue increase, approximately 50 was from wireline activity after business acquisitions in the first quarter of 2024 and approximately 35 from drilling-related services activity. Geographically, the Middle East/North Africa/Asia and the North America regions contributed approximately 65 and 30 , respectively, partly offset by a revenue decline in the Latin America region. 
 
 Of the year-to-date year-over-year revenue increase, approximately 60 was from wireline activity and approximately 30 from drilling-related services. Geographically, the Middle East/North Africa/Asia and Europe/Sub-Sahara Africa/Russia regions contributed approximately 65 and 35 , respectively, partly offset by a revenue decline in the Latin America region. 
 
 DRE segment adjusted EBITDA of 111 million and 371 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was flat compared to 111 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 46 million or 14 , compared to 325 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 certain sales of used rental equipment. 
 
 WCC Results 
 
 WCC revenues of 509 million and 1,471 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 50 million or 11 , and increased 151 million or 11 , compared to 459 million and 1,320 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Of the third quarter year-over-year revenue increase, approximately 55 was from completions activity and approximately 30 from liner hangers activity, partly offset by a revenue decline from lower cementation products activity. Geographically, international regions drove revenue growth and the Middle East/North Africa/Asia region contributed approximately 70 of the international growth and the Latin America and Europe/Sub-Sahara Africa/Russia regions contributed equally to remaining international growth. This was partly offset by a revenue decline in the North America region. 
 
 Of the year-to-date year-over-year revenue increase, approximately 45 was from completions activity and approximately 45 was from liner hangers and tubular running services activity. Geographically, international regions drove the revenue growth and the Middle East/North Africa/Asia region contributed approximately 80 of the international growth. This was partly offset by a revenue decline in the North America region. 
 
 WCC segment adjusted EBITDA of 151 million and 416 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 32 million or 27 , and increased 92 million or 28 , compared to 119 million and 324 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

The increase in revenue and segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily from higher activity. 
 
 PRI Results 
 
 PRI revenues of 371 million and 1,088 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was flat and increased 2 million, compared to 371 million and 1,086 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Revenue in the third quarter remained flat from prior year and consisted of intervention services and drilling tools activity, offset by a decline in pressure pumping activity. Geographically, revenue growth in the Europe/Sub-Sahara Africa/Russia region was offset by a decline primarily in the North America region. 
 
 Of the year-to-date year-over-year revenue increase, revenue growth in intervention services and drilling tools was partly offset by a decline in primarily pressure pumping as well as a decline in artificial lift activity. Geographically, revenue growth primarily in the Europe/Sub-Sahara Africa/Russia region as well as in the Middle East/North Africa/Asia region was offset by a decline in the North America region. 
 
 PRI segment adjusted EBITDA of 83 million and 241 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 3 million or 3 and increased 6 million or 3 compared to 86 million and 235 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

The third quarter year-over-year decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to a decline in pressure pumping activity. The year-to-date year-over-year improvement in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily from higher margin international artificial lift activity. 

All Other Results 
 
 All Other results were from non-core business activities that do not individually meet the criteria for segment reporting, including integrated services and projects, which includes pass through and project management services. 
 
 All Other revenues of 94 million and 329 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 95 million and 213 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Corporate 
 
 Corporate was a net expense of 13 million and 45 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 18 million and 44 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The third quarter year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in certain professional fees and employee incentive programs. 

Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization were 89 million and 260 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 83 million and 244 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a larger asset base. 

Share-based Compensation 
 
 We recognized 10 million and 35 million of share-based compensation in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9 million and 26 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase in equity awards granted. 

Outlook 
 
 Growth and spending in the energy services industry is highly dependent on many external factors. These include but are not limited to: inflation; geopolitical uncertainty; supply chain disruptions; energy policies at local and regional levels; rig counts; and the price of oil and natural gas. We continue to expect overall 2024 revenue to outpace 2023, led by international activity and global offshore activity. We expect there to be continued variability in economic conditions globally, driven primarily by geopolitical events. While the global macroeconomic conditions support continued activity and investments by our customers, there exists a significant risk of activity reduction in certain areas if commodity prices drop significantly. Alternately, there could be a curtailment of activity altogether if security infrastructure in certain regions is compromised due to the ongoing conflicts in multiple regions. At the same time, there could also be a significant uptick in activity if there is a positive shift in hydrocarbon fuel demand or a curtailment of supply due to geopolitical events in certain regions. We anticipate shifts in activity mix and evolution of demand for technology solutions and continue to align our business priorities with market demand trends. We remain constructive on the mid-to-long-term outlook which provides a pathway to a multi-year energy demand expansion. We continue to closely monitor macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, potential supply chain disruptions, inflationary factors, and other labor and logistical constraints that could impact our operations and results. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 920 million and 58 million in restricted cash, compared to 958 million of cash and cash equivalents and 105 million in restricted cash at December 31, 2023. 
 
 The following table summarizes cash flows provided by (used in) each type of business activity in the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2024 
 2023 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 543 457 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities (207) (158) Net Cash Used in Financing Activities (378) (388) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 543 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities of 457 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary operating sources of cash were from the timing of cash generated by our operations, offset by our operating spend, including payments to suppliers and employees. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2024 over 2023 was partly from revenue growth and its conversion to cash as well as from higher than average collections from our largest customer in Mexico.

Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 207 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used in investing activities of 158 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary investing uses of cash were for capital expenditures of 199 million and 142 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Cash used in investing activities also includes the use of the Blue Chip Swap mechanism in Argentina, of which the purchases more than offset the proceeds, resulting in a loss of 10 million and 57 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (see Note 12 Blue Chip Swap Securities - Argentina ), respectively. The increase in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired in the current period was primarily from our acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2024 (see Note 13 Acquisitions ). Other investing activities include proceeds from the sale of investments from our marketable securities in Argentina and proceeds from the disposition of assets, offset by investing spend around other intangibles. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used in financing activities was 378 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used in financing activities of 388 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary financing uses of cash were for repayments and repurchases of long-term debt of 264 million and 306 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively (see Note 6 Borrowings and Other Debt Obligations ), cash dividends and share repurchases. 
 
 On July 23, 2024, we announced that our Board declared a cash dividend of 0.25 per share of the Company s ordinary shares, payable on September 12, 2024 to shareholders of record as of August 13, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, dividends paid were 18 million. 
 
 Also on July 23, 2024, we announced a 500 million share repurchase program. In the third quarter of 2024, share repurchases were 50 million. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities also includes tax remittances on equity awards vested, which were lower this period compared to the same period in the prior year due to a decrease in the quantity of shares vested and the increase in share price of those awards upon vesting. Other financing uses of cash primarily include distributions to noncontrolling interests and bond redemption premiums paid. 

Sources of Liquidity 
 
 Our sources of available liquidity include cash generated by our operations, cash and cash equivalent balances, and periodic accounts receivable factoring. From time to time, we may enter into transactions to dispose of businesses or capital assets that no longer fit our long-term strategy. We historically have accessed banks for short-term loans and the capital markets for debt and equity offerings. Based upon current and anticipated levels of operations and collections, we expect to have sufficient cash from operations and cash on hand to fund our cash requirements (discussed below), both in the short-term and long-term. 

Cash Requirements 
 
 Our cash requirements will continue to include payments for principal and interest on our long-term debt, capital expenditures, payments on our finance and operating leases, payments for short-term working capital needs, operating costs and restructuring payments. As business activity continues to rise, we expect to utilize cash on capital assets and working capital growth. Our cash requirements also include personnel costs, including awards under our employee incentive programs and other amounts to settle litigation related matters. In addition, we have derivative financial instruments where we have notional amounts that do not generally represent cash amounts exchanged by the parties and are calculated based on the terms of the derivative instrument, however, in the event of a related default, we could potentially be required to pay. See further discussion in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ). The credit default swap agreement at Note 11 Credit Default Swap was terminated on July 17, 2024 and the remaining notional balance was extinguished. Our cash requirements also include payments for our shareholder returns programs described in Note 8 Shareholders Equity.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate principal amount of our primary debt outstanding was 1.6 billion of our 2030 Senior Notes. We expect to pay 138 million in interest payments in 2024 specific to this note, of which we have paid 69 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 6 Borrowings and Other Debt Obligations for additional information. 
 
 Our capital spend is expected to be 3-5 of revenue over a 12 to 18 month rolling period and our 2024 capital spend is projected to be within the same framework. Our payments on our operating and finance leases in 2024 are expected to be approximately 63 million and 26 million, respectively. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by subsidiaries outside of Ireland. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had approximately 118 million and 92 million, respectively, of our cash and cash equivalents that cannot be immediately repatriated from various countries due to country central bank controls or other regulations. As we continue to conduct business in certain countries with cash that cannot be immediately repatriated, we may consider infrequent transactions to safeguard our cash from exposure to the effects of inflation and currency devaluation. Repatriation of those cash balances might result in incremental taxes or losses. 

Ratings Services Credit Ratings 
 
 Our credit ratings at December 31, 2023 have been maintained and upgraded through our current filing date as follows: 
 Standard and Poor S P) and Fitch Ratings Fitch upgraded our issuer credit ratings from B+ to BB-; there have been no updates to the S P and Fitch outlook since December 31, 2023 
 There have been no updates to the Moody's Investors Service rating since December 31, 2023 

Customer Receivables 
 
 We may experience delays or defaults in customer payments due to, among other reasons, a weaker economic environment, reductions in our customers cash flow from operations, our customers inability to access credit markets or reach acceptable financing terms, as well as unsettled political and/or social conditions. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Adjustments to the allowance are made depending on how potential issues are resolved and the financial condition of our customers. In addition, our customers are primarily in fossil fuel-related industries and broad declines in demand for or pricing of oil or natural gas might impact the collections of our customer receivables. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our net accounts receivables in the U.S. was 11 of total net accounts receivables for both periods. 
 
 Our net accounts receivables in Mexico were 26 and 27 of our total net accounts receivables, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which our largest customer in the country accounted for 21 and 22 of our total net outstanding accounts receivables, respectively. We have experienced delays in payments from our largest customer in Mexico. The balances due are not in dispute, however, additional or continued delays in customer payments in the future could differ from historical practice and management s current expectations, and failures to pay or defaults, if any, could negatively impact the future results of the Company. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we paid an immaterial amount of fees to third-party financial institutions to facilitate loans between those financial institutions and our largest customer in Mexico, who in turn paid certain of our outstanding receivables. Pursuant to such arrangements, we received 317 million and 459 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 we had no obligations under those loans. 
 
 Except for the above, no other country accounted for more than 10 of our net accounts receivables balance. 

Accounts Receivable Factoring 
 
 From time to time, we participate in factoring arrangements to sell accounts receivable to third-party financial institutions for cash proceeds net of discounts and hold-back. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold accounts receivable balances of 4 million and 55 million, and received cash proceeds of 4 million and 54 million, respectively, at the time of factoring.

Subject to Section 4(b) , in the event the Participant s Service is terminated due to the Participant s death or Disability, the Shares subject to the PSUs that have not yet vested shall become earned and vested at the end of the Performance Period based on actual performance. 
 (c) Termination due to Retirement . Subject to Section 4(b) , in the event the Participant s Service is terminated by the Participant due to Retirement and the Participant s date of termination due to Retirement occurs on or after the 11 th month anniversary of the Grant Date, a pro-rated portion of the Award shall remain eligible to vest at the end of the Performance Period based on actual performance, with such pro-rated portion, if any, determined by multiplying the number of Earned PSUs by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from the Grant Date through the Participant s date of termination due to Retirement, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Performance Period. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Participant s termination of Service due to Retirement occurs prior to the 11 th month anniversary of the Grant Date, the PSUs shall be immediately forfeited. For purposes of this Section 3(c) , Retirement means the Participant s voluntary termination of Service after attainment of age 60, with at least ten years of Service and at least six months prior written notice to the Company. 
 (d) Change in Control . Subject to Section 4(b) , and not withstanding Section 3(b) or (c) , if a Change in Control occurs, the successor or purchaser in the Change in Control has assumed the Company s obligations with respect to the PSUs or provided a substitute award and the Participant (i) has a Qualifying Termination (as defined in the Company s Change in Control Severance Plan) or (ii) remains employed with the Company through the end of the Performance Period, then the PSUs shall become earned and vested as of the time immediately prior to the earlier of the Qualifying Termination and the Change in Control (y) at Target achievement of the Performance Goals, if the Change in Control occurs within 12 months following the Grant Date hereunder, or (z) at the greater of Target achievement or the actual achievement of the Performance Goals through the date of the Change in Control, if such Change in Control occurs on or after 12 months following the Grant Date hereunder provided that if such Qualifying Termination occurs prior to a Change in Control, then the PSUs shall become earned and vested as of the time immediately prior to the Qualifying Termination at the greater of Target achievement or the actual achievement of the Performance Goals through the date of such Change in Control.
