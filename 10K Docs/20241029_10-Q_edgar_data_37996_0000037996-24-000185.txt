 As a result of changes in our estimate of variable consideration (e.g., marketing incentives), we recorded a de minimis adjustment related to revenue recognized in prior periods in the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of million in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 We had a balance of billion and billion of unearned revenue associated primarily with outstanding extended service contracts reported in Other liabilities and deferred revenue at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively . We expect to recognize approximately million of the unearned amount in the remainder of 2024, billion in 2025, and billion thereafter. We recognized million and million of unearned amounts from prior years as revenue during the third quarter of 2023 and 2024, respectively, and billion and billion in the nine months of 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
 
 Amounts paid to dealers to obtain extended service contracts are deferred and recorded as Other assets . We had a balance of million and million in deferred costs as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. We recognized million of amortization during both the third quarter of 2023 and 2024, respectively, and million and million in the first nine months of 2023 and 2024, respectively.

 The credit quality analysis of consumer receivables at September 30, 2024 was as follows (in millions):

 Non-Consumer Portfolio. The credit quality of dealer financing receivables is evaluated based on Ford Credit s internal dealer risk rating analysis. Ford Credit uses a proprietary model to assign each dealer a risk rating. This model uses historical dealer performance data to identify key factors about a dealer that are considered most significant in predicting a dealer s ability to meet its financial obligations. Ford Credit also considers numerous other financial and qualitative factors of the dealer s operations, including capitalization and leverage, liquidity and cash flow, profitability, and credit history with Ford Credit and other creditors. 
 
 Dealers are assigned to one of four groups according to risk ratings as follows: 
 
 Group I strong to superior financial metrics; 
 Group II fair to favorable financial metrics; 
 Group III marginal to weak financial metrics; and 
 Group IV poor financial metrics, including dealers classified as uncollectible.

 Non-Accrual of Revenue. The accrual of financing revenue is discontinued at the time a receivable is determined to be uncollectible or when it is days past due. Accounts may be restored to accrual status only when a customer settles all past-due deficiency balances and future payments are reasonably assured. For receivables in non-accrual status, subsequent financing revenue is recognized only to the extent a payment is received. Payments are generally applied first to outstanding interest and then to the unpaid principal balance. 
 
 Loan Modifications. Consumer and non-consumer receivables that have a modified interest rate and/or a term extension (including receivables that were modified in reorganization proceedings pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) are typically considered to be loan modifications. Ford Credit does not grant modifications to the principal balance of the receivables. If a receivable is modified in a reorganization proceeding, all payment requirements of the reorganization plan need to be met before remaining balances are forgiven. 
 
 The use of interest rate modifications and term extensions helps Ford Credit mitigate financial loss. Term extensions may assist in cases where Ford Credit believes the customer will recover from short-term financial difficulty and resume regularly scheduled payments. The effect of most loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is included in the historical trends used to measure the allowance for credit losses. A loan modification that improves the delinquency status of a borrower reduces the probability of default, which results in a lower allowance for credit losses. At September 30, 2024, an insignificant portion of Ford Credit's total finance receivables portfolio had been granted a loan modification, and these modifications are generally treated as a continuation of the existing loan.

 Charge-offs on finance receivables include uncollected amounts related to principal, interest, late fees, and other allowable charges. Recoveries on finance receivables previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance for credit losses. In the event Ford Credit repossesses the collateral, the receivable is charged off and the collateral is recorded at its estimated fair value less costs to sell and reported in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

The carrying value of recorded liabilities related to financial guarantees was million and million at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Our financial guarantees consist of debt and lease obligations of certain joint ventures, as well as certain financial obligations of outside third parties, including suppliers, to support our business and economic growth. Expiration dates vary through 2037, and guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the underlying obligation. A payment by us would be triggered by failure of the joint venture or other third party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee. In some circumstances, we are entitled to recover from a third party amounts paid by us under the guarantee.

 In the ordinary course of business, we execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction, such as the sale of a business. These indemnifications might include and are not limited to claims relating to any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; power generation contracts; governmental regulations and employment-related matters; dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships; and financial matters, such as securitizations. Performance under these indemnities generally would be triggered by a breach of contract claim brought by a counterparty, including a joint venture or alliance partner, or a third-party claim. While some of these indemnifications are limited in nature, many of them do not limit potential payment. Therefore, we are unable to estimate a maximum amount of future payments that could result from claims made under these unlimited indemnities.

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 Electric Vehicle Market 
 
 Although we continue to invest in our electric vehicle strategy, we have observed lower-than-anticipated industrywide electric vehicle adoption rates and near-term pricing pressures, which has led us, and may in the future lead us, to adjust our spending, production, and/or product launches to better match the pace of electric vehicle adoption. As a result, we recorded about 1.1 billion of expenses in the third quarter of 2024 and may continue to incur expenses related to payments to our electric vehicle-related suppliers (battery, raw material, or otherwise), inventory adjustments, or other matters. The third quarter amount includes 979 million related to the cancellation of a previously announced all-electric three-row SUV program. We may incur additional expenses and cash expenditures of up to about 900 million related to the cancellation, the majority of which we expect to record by the first half of 2025. Further, significant unexpected changes in the EV demand environment have led, and may in the future lead, to incremental competitive pricing actions. These market dynamics may continue to occur, which could have a substantial impact on our business. 
 
 In addition, slower-than-anticipated development of the electric vehicle market may impact our strategy to comply with regulatory standards, and, in some cases, we plan to utilize credits purchased from third parties to demonstrate regulatory compliance or we may need to modify our product offerings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10 K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks related to lower-than-anticipated electric vehicle volumes and our planned transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was 892 million, and Company adjusted EBIT was 2,550 million. 
 
 Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions):

 __________ 
 (a) Includes related tax effect on special items and tax special items. 
 
 We recorded 1.4 billion of pre-tax special item charges in the third quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting a write-down of certain product-specific assets and other expenses related to the cancellation of a previously planned all-electric three-row SUV program, pension curtailment costs and remeasurement losses (primarily related to hourly buyouts in North America), and continued restructuring actions in Europe. 
 
 In Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among our segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources.

 The year-over-year decrease of 307 million in net income was primarily driven by the three-row SUV EV program cancellation special item, offset partially by higher Company adjusted EBIT and lower tax expense. The year-over-year increase of 352 million in Company adjusted EBIT was driven by higher Ford Credit and Ford Pro EBIT and a lower Ford Model e EBIT loss, offset partially by lower Ford Blue EBIT.

 In the third quarter of 2024, Ford Blue s wholesales decreased 2 from a year ago, driven primarily by the end of production of the Edge in North America and fewer vehicles produced and sold in China by our unconsolidated affiliates, offset partially by higher Bronco and F-150 wholesales. Third quarter 2024 revenue increased 3 , driven primarily by higher wholesales excluding our unconsolidated affiliates in China, offset partially by unfavorable exchange. 
 
 Ford Blue s third quarter 2024 EBIT was 1.6 billion, a decrease of 91 million from a year ago, with an EBIT margin of 6.2 . The lower EBIT was primarily driven by unfavorable exchange and higher manufacturing cost, offset partially by lower warranty costs and higher net pricing.

 In the third quarter of 2024, Ford Model e s wholesales decreased 11 from a year ago to 32,000 units due to competitive market conditions. Third quarter 2024 revenue decreased 33 , reflecting a more competitive EV demand environment (including new entrants to the market), which resulted in lower net pricing and lower wholesales. 
 
 Ford Model e s third quarter 2024 EBIT loss was 1.2 billion, a 105 million improvement from a year ago, with an EBIT margin of negative 104.4 . The improved EBIT was primarily driven by lower costs (including lower battery-related raw material costs as well as other material costs and lower warranty), offset partially by unfavorable net pricing.

 In the third quarter of 2024, Ford Pro s wholesales increased 9 from a year ago more than explained by higher sales of the Transit family of vehicles and Super Duty. Third quarter 2024 revenue increased 13 , reflecting higher wholesales, favorable mix, and higher net pricing driven by continued strong demand for certain core Ford Pro products. 
 
 Ford Pro s third quarter 2024 EBIT was 1.8 billion, an increase of 160 million from a year ago, with an EBIT margin of 11.6 . The EBIT improvement was driven by favorable market factors, offset partially by higher warranty costs and growth-related structural costs.

 Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro Causal Factors 
 
 In general, we measure year-over-year change in Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-period volume and mix and exchange: 
 
 Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units): 
 Volume and Mix primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line 
 Net Pricing primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory 
 
 Cost: 
 Contribution Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs 
 Structural Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost categories: 
 Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules 
 Engineering and Connectivity consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services 
 Spending-Related consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases 
 Advertising and Sales Promotions includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows 
 Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions 
 
 Exchange primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging 
 
 Other includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes 
 
 In addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include: 
 
 Wholesales and Revenue wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. JMC ), that are sold to dealerships or others. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue. Excludes transactions between Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments

 Ford Credit s total net receivables of 142.2 billion were 13 higher than a year ago, explained primarily by higher consumer and non-consumer financing and a larger lease portfolio. The third quarter 2024 U.S. loss-to-receivables LTR ratio of 57 basis points increased from a year ago, reflecting increased loss severity and higher repossessions. U.S. auction values in the third quarter of 2024 were lower year over year. 
 
 Ford Credit s third quarter 2024 EBT of 544 million was 186 million higher than a year ago, explained primarily by higher financing margin and higher receivables, offset partially by lower expected auction values and higher return rates on existing operating leases. 
 41 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors 
 
 In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit s EBT using the causal factors listed below: 
 
 Volume and Mix: 
 Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding 
 Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit s average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region 
 
 Financing Margin: 
 Financing margin variance is the period-over-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period 
 Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management 
 
 Credit Loss: 
 Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses 
 Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report 
 
 Lease Residual: 
 Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation 
 Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term and changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report 
 
 Exchange: 
 Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars 
 
 Other: 
 Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates 
 Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts 
 In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items 
 42 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report: 
 
 Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, excluding amounts related to insurance activities 
 
 Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) Debt on Ford Credit s balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions 
 
 Earnings Before Taxes EBT Reflects Ford Credit s income before income taxes 
 
 Loss-to-Receivables LTR Ratio LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses 
 
 Return on Equity ROE (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period 
 
 Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements 
 
 Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada 
 
 Term Asset-Backed Securities (as shown in the Funding Structure table) Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements 
 
 Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors 

43 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Corporate Other 
 
 Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and OPEB income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company s interests. In the third quarter of 2024, Corporate Other had a 201 million EBIT loss, compared to a 186 million EBIT loss a year ago. 

Interest on Debt 
 
 Interest on Debt, which consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit, was 272 million in the third quarter of 2024, 52 million lower than a year ago. 

Taxes 
 
 Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was a benefit of 27 million and a provision of 856 million, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of negative 3.1 and 17.4 , respectively. During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized tax benefits from a change in our full-year forecast of tax expense, including benefits related to the write-down of certain product-specific manufacturing and vendor tooling assets classified as a special item. 
 
 Our third quarter and first nine months of 2024 adjusted effective tax rates, which exclude special items, were 13.9 and 19.2 , respectively. 
 
 We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 At September 30, 2024, total balance sheet cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including Ford Credit and entities held for sale, was 37.2 billion. 
 
 We consider our key balance sheet metrics to be: (i) Company cash, which includes cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including cash held for sale, excluding Ford Credit s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash; and (ii) Company liquidity, which includes Company cash, less restricted cash, and total available committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit s total available committed credit lines.

The discount rate and rate of expected return assumptions are unchanged from year-end 2023. 
 
 Liquidity . Our key priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet to withstand potential stress scenarios, while having resources available to invest in and grow our business. At September 30, 2024, we had Company cash of 27.9 billion and liquidity of 46.1 billion. At September 30, 2024, about 84 of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. 
 
 To be prepared for an economic downturn and other stress scenarios, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above 20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic or operating environment. 
 
 Our Company cash investments primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis.

 Cash effects related to the restructuring of our business 
 
 Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification 
 
 Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased share-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. We target shareholder distributions of 40 to 50 of adjusted free cash flow. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. 
 
 We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements. 

46 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit). 
 
 With respect to Changes in working capital, in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. 
 
 Our finished product inventory at September 30, 2024 was higher than at December 31, 2023, reflecting higher in-plant and in-transit inventory, partially driven by new vehicle launches. 
 
 In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to a maximum of 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Our actual capital outlay could vary significantly based on the final project costs and potential financing opportunities. Such investments could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. 
 
 The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms may also include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials or otherwise compensate the supplier in an amount determined by the contract. As of September 30, 2024, our estimated expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements through 2035, subject to certain conditions, consist of approximately 3.4 billion of purchase obligations and approximately 4.9 billion of contingent purchase obligations based on our present forecast; however, our forecast could fluctuate from period to period based on market prices, which could result in significant increases or decreases in our estimate. The actual price paid for these materials will be recorded on our balance sheet at the time of purchase. In the event that we do not expect to consume all of the materials we are obligated to purchase pursuant to the terms of these agreements, we may sell the excess materials to a replacement purchaser or back to the supplier. The resale price may or may not be the same as the original purchase price, depending on then-current market conditions and negotiated terms. As a result, we have recorded, and may in the future record, accruals related to either the resale when the purchase price mechanism under our agreements is higher than the expected resale price of the excess materials or when we are required to otherwise compensate the supplier. Accruals recorded to date for such items have been immaterial. 

47 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 As market conditions dictate, we have and may in the future enter into additional offtake agreements with raw material suppliers or renegotiate existing agreements. In addition, as mentioned above, we may seek to resell excess materials. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in the first half of 2025. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks related to our offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts. 
 
 Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 211 million. The amount settled through the SCF program during the first nine months of 2024 was 1.1 billion.

 Our third quarter 2024 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was positive 5.5 billion, 0.9 billion higher than a year ago (see page 61 for additional information). The increase reflects higher working capital, offset partially by lower Ford Credit operating cash flow and lower net income. Company adjusted free cash flow was 3.2 billion, 2.0 billion higher than a year ago, primarily driven by working capital changes, adjusted EBIT improvement, and Ford Credit distributions, offset partially by all other and timing differences. 
 
 Capital spending was 2.0 billion in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 0.2 billion from a year ago. We now expect full year 2024 capital spending to be in the range of 8 billion to 8.5 billion. 
 48 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Third quarter 2024 working capital impact was 0.8 billion, driven by higher trade payables, partially offset by higher inventory, each compared to June 30, 2024. All other and timing differences were positive 1.4 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers, JV equity income, compensation payments, and pension and OPEB income or expense). Cash outflows related to our warranty accruals are expected to occur over several years. 
 
 In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, we contributed 334 million and 967 million, respectively, to our global funded pension plans. We continue to expect to contribute about 1 billion to our global funded pension plans in 2024. 
 
 Shareholder distributions (including cash dividends and anti-dilutive share repurchases) were 0.6 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and 2.8 billion for the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Available Credit Lines . Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at September 30, 2024 were 20.2 billion, consisting of 13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, 2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, 2.5 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and 2.2 billion of local credit facilities. At September 30, 2024, 1.8 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates, and the full amount under each of our corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit facilities was available. 
 
 Lenders under our corporate credit facility have 25 million of commitments maturing on April 26, 2026, 3.4 billion of commitments maturing on April 22, 2027, 0.1 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2028, and 10.0 billion of commitments maturing on April 20, 2029. Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility have 2.0 billion of commitments maturing on April 22, 2027. Lenders under our 364-day revolving credit facility have 2.5 billion of commitments maturing on April 21, 2025. 
 
 The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, carbon-free electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO 2 tailpipe emissions. Prior to 2024, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO 2 tailpipe emissions; Ford outperformed all three of these sustainability-linked metrics in 2023. 
 
 The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of 4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. If our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P, the guarantees of certain subsidiaries will be required. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility. 
 
 Debt. As shown in Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at September 30, 2024, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 20.6 billion. This balance is 0.7 billion higher than at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit). 
 
 Ford Credit s leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Ford Credit Segment section of Item 2. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit.

 Ford Credit Segment 
 
 Ford Credit remains well capitalized with a strong balance sheet and funding diversified across platforms and markets. Ford Credit ended the third quarter of 2024 with 29.6 billion of liquidity, up 3.9 billion from year-end. Ford Credit continues to have robust access to capital markets, completing 29 billion of public term issuances through October 25, 2024. 
 
 Key elements of Ford Credit s funding strategy include: 
 
 Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity 
 Prudently access public markets 
 Continue to leverage retail deposits in Europe 
 Flexibility to increase asset-backed securities mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity 
 Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1 
 Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet 
 
 Ford Credit s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles. 
 
 The following table shows funding for Ford Credit s net receivables (in billions): 
 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 Funding Structure Term unsecured debt 50.7 54.1 61.7 Term asset-backed securities 55.9 58.0 56.3 Retail Deposits / Ford Interest Advantage 16.3 17.2 18.7 Other 2.2 1.4 0.1 Equity 12.6 13.4 14.0 Cash (11.4) (10.9) (8.6) Total Net Receivables 126.3 133.2 142.2 Securitized Funding as Percent of Total Debt 45.5 44.9 41.2 
 
 Net receivables of 142.2 billion at September 30, 2024 were funded primarily with term unsecured debt and term asset-backed securities. Securitized funding as a percent of total debt was 41.2 as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Public Term Funding Plan. The following table shows Ford Credit s issuances for full year 2022 and 2023, planned issuances for full year 2024, and its global public term funding issuances through October 25, 2024, excluding short-term funding programs (in billions):

 __________ 
 (a) See Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors section. 
 
 Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use will fluctuate quarterly based on factors including near-term debt maturities, receivable growth and decline, and timing of funding transactions. At September 30, 2024, Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use was 29.6 billion, 3.9 billion higher than year-end 2023, primarily reflecting strong access to public funding markets resulting in lower utilization of committed asset-backed facilities. At September 30, 2024, Ford Credit s liquidity sources, including cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities, totaled 55.0 billion, down 1.2 billion from year-end 2023, primarily explained by lower cash due to higher receivables. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K Report). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit s Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. 
 
 Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements. 
 
 Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets, that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities issuance and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Ford Credit Segment - Funding and Liquidity Risks section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report for more information.

 Total Company 
 
 Pension Plans - Funded Balances. As of September 30, 2024, our total Company pension underfunded status reported on our consolidated balance sheets was 1.3 billion and reflects the net funded status at December 31, 2023, updated for: service and interest cost; expected return on assets; curtailments, settlements, and associated interim remeasurement (where applicable); separation expense; actual benefit payments; and cash contributions. For plans without interim remeasurement, the discount rate and rate of expected return assumptions are unchanged from year-end 2023. 
 
 Return on Invested Capital ROIC ). We analyze total Company performance using an adjusted ROIC financial metric based on an after-tax, rolling four-quarter average. The following table contains the calculation of our ROIC for the periods shown (in billions):

 CREDIT RATINGS 
 
 Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: DBRS, Fitch, Moody s, and S P. 
 
 In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. 
 
 There have been no rating actions taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 The following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs:

 OUTLOOK 
 
 We provided 2024 Company guidance in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K dated October 28, 2024. The guidance is based on our expectations as of October 28, 2024, and assumes no material change to our current assumptions for inflation, logistics issues, production, or macroeconomic conditions. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in Risk Factors in Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC. 
 
 2024 Guidance Total Company Adjusted EBIT (a) About 10 billion Adjusted Free Cash Flow (a) 7.5 - 8.5 billion Capital spending 8 - 8.5 billion Ford Credit EBT About 1.6 billion 
 __________ 
 (a) When we provide guidance for Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, we do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP measures because, as described in more detail below in Non-GAAP Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures, they include items that are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty. 
 
 For full-year 2024, we now expect adjusted EBIT of about 10 billion and adjusted free cash flow of 7.5 billion to 8.5 billion, including lower-than-planned volume in the second half of 2024 for Ford Pro and Ford Blue due to supplier disruptions. 
 
 On a segment basis, we now expect: 
 
 Ford Pro EBIT of about 9 billion driven by continued growth and favorable mix as well as continued pricing strength on core products 
 Ford Blue EBIT of about 5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and higher product, manufacturing, and warranty costs, offset partially by cost efficiencies 
 Ford Model e EBIT loss of about 5 billion driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new electric vehicles 
 Ford Credit EBT of about 1.6 billion 
 
 Our outlook for 2024 assumes: 
 
 Flat to modest U.S. industry growth at 16 million to 16.5 million 
 Full year of all-new Super Duty, which drives positive pricing and mix in Ford Pro 
 Lower industry pricing 
 2 billion of cost reductions in material, freight, and manufacturing

 Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: 
 
 Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford s production of vehicles; 
 To facilitate access to the raw materials and other components necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into and may, in the future, enter into multi-year commitments to raw material and other suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such items as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; 
 Ford s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+; 
 Ford s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, or delays in new model launches, and the time it takes to improve the quality of our vehicles and services could continue to have an adverse effect on our business; 
 Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or business strategies; 
 Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring actions and such actions may cause Ford to incur significant charges, disrupt our operations, or harm our reputation; 
 Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers; 
 Ford s production, as well as Ford s suppliers production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, public health issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; 
 Failure to develop and deploy secure digital services that appeal to customers could have a negative impact on Ford s business; 
 Ford s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; 
 Ford s ability to attract, develop, grow, and reward talent is critical to its success and competitiveness; 
 Ford s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; 
 Ford s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; 
 With a global footprint and supply chain, Ford s results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; 
 Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, public health emergency, or significant geopolitical event; 
 Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors, particularly for electric vehicles; 
 Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; 
 Ford and Ford Credit s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; 
 The impact of government incentives on Ford s business could be significant, and Ford s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; 
 Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles; 
 Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed; 
 Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford s liquidity and financial condition; 
 Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; 
 Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations; 
 Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, data protection, and artificial intelligence laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and 
 Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES 
 
 We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. 
 
 Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: 
 
 Pre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally 100 million or more for other items 
 
 When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. 
 
 Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) Company adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. 
 
 Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) Measure of Company s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. 
 
 Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) Measure of Company s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. 
 58 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) Measure of Company s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. 
 
 Adjusted ROIC Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension/OPEB liability.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Company Excluding Ford Credit 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk. The net fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of September 30, 2024, was a liability of 396 million, compared with a liability of 319 million as of December 31, 2023. The potential change in the fair value from a 10 change in the underlying exchange rates, in U.S. dollar terms, would have been 3.0 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 3.1 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk. The net fair value of commodity forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of September 30, 2024, was an asset of 41 million, compared with a liability of 9 million at December 31, 2023. The potential change in the fair value from a 10 change in the underlying commodity prices would have been 198 million at September 30, 2024, compared with 203 million at December 31, 2023. 

Ford Credit Segment 
 
 Interest Rate Risk . To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pre-tax cash flow to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous decrease or increase of one percentage point in all interest rates across all maturities (a parallel shift ), as well as a base case that assumes that all interest rates remain constant at existing levels. Maturing assets and liabilities are also instantaneously reinvested, capturing 100 of any hypothetical change in interest rates. The differences in pre-tax cash flow between these scenarios and the base case over a 12-month period represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credit s pre-tax cash flow . Under this model, Ford Credit estimates that at September 30, 2024, all else constant, such a decrease in interest rates would decrease its pre-tax cash flow by 103 million over the next 12 months, compared with a decrease of 78 million at December 31, 2023 . In reality, new assets and liabilities may not immediately capture changes in interest rates, and interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous, parallel, or move exactly the one percentage point assumed in Ford Credit s analysis. As a result, the actual impact to pre-tax cash flow could be higher or lower than the results detailed above. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. James D. Farley, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer CEO ), and John T. Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), have performed an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024, and each has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 
 Any legal proceeding arising under any federal, state, or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, in which (i) a governmental authority is a party, and (ii) we believe there is the possibility of monetary sanctions (exclusive of interest and costs) in excess of 1,000,000 is described on page 35 of our 2023 Form 10-K Report. 
 
 OTHER MATTERS 
 
 Brazilian Tax Matters (as previously reported on page 35 of our 2023 Form 10-K Report, page 66 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and page 67 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024). One Brazilian state (S o Paulo) and the Brazilian federal tax authority currently have outstanding substantial tax assessments against Ford Motor Company Brasil Ltda. Ford Brazil related to state and federal tax incentives Ford Brazil received for its operations in the Brazilian state of Bahia. The S o Paulo assessment is part of a broader conflict among various states in Brazil. The federal legislature enacted laws designed to encourage the states to end that conflict, and in 2017 the states reached an agreement on a framework for resolution. Ford Brazil continues to pursue a resolution under the framework and expects the amount of any remaining assessments by the states to be resolved under that framework. The federal assessments are outside the scope of the legislation. 
 
 All of the outstanding assessments have been appealed to the relevant administrative court of each jurisdiction. To proceed with an appeal within the judicial court system, an appellant may be required to post collateral. To date, we have not been required to post any collateral. If we are required to post collateral, which could be in excess of 1 billion, we expect it to be in the form of fixed assets, surety bonds, and/or letters of credit, but we may be required to post cash collateral. Although the ultimate resolution of these matters may take many years, we consider our overall risk of loss to be remote.

ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased shares of Ford Common Stock as part of an anti-dilutive share repurchase program to offset the dilutive effect of share-based compensation granted during 2024. The program originally authorized repurchases of up to 53 million shares of Ford Common Stock.
