Explanatory Note 
 
 Duolingo, Inc.

This Amendment is being filed to revise Part II Item 5. Other Information by adding disclosure regarding a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K) entered into by Luis von Ahn, our Chief Executive Officer and member of the Company s Board of Directors, and by the Luis von Ahn Foundation, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which was inadvertently omitted from the disclosure included in the Original Filing, and making some unrelated non-substantive edits. 
 
 In addition, as required by Rule 12b-15 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), new certifications by the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer are filed herewith as exhibits to this Amendment, under Part II, Item 6 hereof, pursuant to Rule 13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a) of the Exchange Act. Because no financial statements have been included in this Amendment and this Amendment does not contain or amend any disclosure with respect to Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the certifications have been omitted. The Company is also not including new certifications under Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of Title 18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 1350) (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), as no financial statements are being filed with this Amendment. 
 
 Other than as expressly set forth herein, this Amendment does not, and does not purport to, amend, update or restate the information in Original Filing or reflect any events that have occurred after the date the Original Filing was made. Information not affected by this Amendment remains unchanged and reflects the disclosures made at the time as of which the Original Filing was made. No changes have been made to the financial statements of the Company as contained in the Original Filing. Accordingly, this Amendment should be read together with the Original Filing and the Company s other filings with the SEC.
