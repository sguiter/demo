 Interest rate swap contracts Level II Liabilities: Interest rate swap contracts Level II Contingent consideration related to acquisitions Level III 
 Our money market funds which are classified as cash equivalents are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. 
 The interest rate swap contracts on our consolidated balance sheets are valued using market-based inputs to valuation models. These valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, and measures of volatility. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit risk considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. Since model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgment, we have concluded that these instruments should be classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate: 
 Credit Facility Debt, Senior Notes, Senior Guaranteed Notes, Senior Secured Notes, Notes Payable, and Supply Chain Financing 
 The fair values of each of our debt instruments are based on quoted market prices of these instruments. The fair value of notes payable is based primarily on the present value of the remaining payments discounted at the borrowing cost. The carrying value of outstanding amounts related to supply chain financing agreements approximates the fair value due to their short-term maturity (less than one year). 
 The carrying values, estimated fair values, and classification under the fair value hierarchy of our financial instruments, excluding those that are carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, are summarized below: 
 Senior guaranteed notes and senior secured notes Level II Senior notes Level II Notes payable and supply chain financing Level II

 Certain numerical figures included in this Quarterly Report have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, such numerical figures shown as totals in various tables may not be arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them. 
 All dollar amounts, except per customer and per share data, included in the following discussion, are presented in thousands. 
 Overview 
 Our Business 
 We principally provide broadband communications and video services in the United States and market our services primarily under the Optimum brand. We deliver broadband, video, telephony, and mobile services to approximately 4.6 million residential and business customers across our footprint. Our footprint extends across 21 states (primarily in the New York metropolitan area and various markets in the south-central United States) through a fiber-rich hybrid-fiber coaxial ("HFC") broadband network and a fiber-to-the-home ("FTTH") network with approximately 9.8 million total passings as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, we offer news programming and advertising services. 
 Key Factors Impacting Operating Results and Financial Condition 
 Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on the impact of direct competition, general economic conditions (including capital and credit market conditions), our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. For more information, see "Risk Factors" and "Business-Competition" included in our Annual Report and the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report. 
 We derive revenue principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our broadband, video, telephony and mobile services. We also derive revenue from digital video recorder, video-on-demand ("VOD"), pay-per-view, installation and home shopping commissions. Our residential broadband, video, telephony and mobile services accounted for approximately 41 , 33 , 3 , and 1 , respectively, of our consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We also derive revenue from the sale of a wide and growing variety of products and services to both large enterprise and small and medium-sized business ("SMB") customers, including broadband, telephony, networking, video, and mobile services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 16 of our 

33 

consolidated revenue was derived from these business services. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of advertising inventory available on the programming carried on our cable television systems, as well as other systems (linear revenue), digital advertising, data analytics and affiliation fees for news programming, which accounted for approximately 5 of our consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our other revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which includes mobile equipment revenue, accounted for approximately 1 of our consolidated revenue. 
 Revenue is impacted by rate increases, changes in promotional offerings, changes in the number of customers that subscribe to our services, including additional services sold to our existing customers, programming package changes by our video customers, speed tier changes by our broadband customers, acquisitions/dispositions, and construction of cable systems that result in the addition of new customers. Additionally, the allocation of revenue between the residential offerings is impacted by changes in the standalone selling price of each performance obligation within our promotional bundled offers. 
 We operate in a highly competitive consumer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of broadband, video, mobile, fixed wireless broadband and fixed-line telephony providers and delivery systems, including broadband communications companies, wireless data and telephony providers, fiber-based service providers, satellite delivered video signals, Internet-delivered video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers in our service areas. Our competitors include AT T Inc., DirecTV, DISH Network Corporation, Frontier Communications Parent, Inc., Lumen Technologies, Inc., T-Mobile US, Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc., among others. Consumers' selection of an alternate source of service, whether due to economic constraints, technological advances, or preference, negatively impacts the demand for our services. For more information on our competitive landscape, see "Risk Factors" and "Business-Competition" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Our programming costs, which are the most significant component of our operating expenses, are impacted by increases in contractual rates, changes in the number of customers receiving certain programming services, and new channel launches. We expect contractual rates to increase in the future. See "Results of Operations" below for more information regarding the key factors impacting our revenues and operating expenses. 
 Historically, we have made substantial investments in our network and the development of new and innovative products and other service offerings for our customers as a way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors and we expect to do so in the future. Our ongoing FTTH network build has enabled us to deliver multi-gig broadband speeds to FTTH customers in order to meet the growing data needs of residential and business customers. In addition, we launched a full service mobile offering to consumers across our footprint. We may incur greater than anticipated capital expenditures in connection with these initiatives, fail to realize anticipated benefits, experience delays and business disruptions or encounter other challenges to executing them as planned. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources- Capital Expenditures" for additional information regarding our capital expenditures. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income (loss) excluding income taxes, non-operating income or expenses, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts, gain (loss) on derivative contracts, gain (loss) on investments and sale of affiliate interests, interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, restructuring, impairments and other operating items (such as significant legal settlements and contractual payments for terminated employees). See reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA below. 
 Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our business and from intangible assets recognized from acquisitions, as well as certain non-cash and other operating items that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is unaffected by our capital and tax structures and by our investment activities. 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry. Internally, we use revenue and Adjusted EBITDA measures as important indicators of our business performance and evaluate management s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business and operating results by excluding items that are not comparable across reporting periods or that do not otherwise relate to our ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Since Adjusted 

34 

EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. 
 We also use Free Cash Flow (defined as net cash flows from operating activities less cash capital expenditures) as a liquidity measure. We believe this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments with internally generated funds, although it may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

In addition, it includes commercial establishments that have connected to our HFC and FTTH network. Broadband services were not available to approximately 30 thousand passings and telephony services were not available to approximately 500 thousand passings. 
 (b) Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of our fixed-line services. Customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets on our HFC and FTTH network. Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group. Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services and certain equipment fees. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an apartment building, we count each subscribing unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer. We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual rooms at that hotel. Total customer relationships exclude mobile-only customer relationships. 
 (c) Represents the number of total customer relationships divided by total passings. 
 (d) Calculated by dividing the average monthly revenue for the respective quarter (fourth quarter for annual periods) derived from the sale of broadband, video, telephony and mobile services to residential customers by the average number of total residential customers for the same period (excluding mobile-only customer relationships). 
 (e) Represents the estimated number of single residence homes, apartments and condominium units passed by the FTTH network in areas serviceable without further extending the transmission lines. In addition, it includes commercial establishments that have connected to our FTTH network. 
 (f) Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of our fixed-line services on our FTTH network.

 Programming and Other Direct Costs 
 Programming and other direct costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 711,330 and 2,174,677, respectively, and 750,538 and 2,284,537 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Programming and other direct costs include cable programming costs, which are costs paid to programmers (net of amortization of any incentives received from programmers for carriage) for cable content (including costs of VOD and pay-per-view) and are generally paid on a per-customer basis. These costs are impacted by increases in contractual rates, changes in the number of customers receiving certain programming services, and new channel launches. These costs also include interconnection, call completion, circuit and transport fees paid to other telecommunication companies for the transport and termination of voice and data services, which typically vary based on rate changes and the level of usage by our customers. These costs also include franchise fees which are payable to the state governments and local municipalities where we operate and are primarily based on a percentage of certain categories of revenue derived from the provision of video service over our cable systems, which vary by state and municipality. These costs change in relation to changes in such categories of revenues or rate changes. Additionally, these costs include the cost of media for advertising spots sold, the cost of mobile devices sold to our customers and direct costs of providing mobile services.

 Other income (loss), net amounted to (1,495) and (4,526) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (1,470) and 7,165 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These amounts include the non-service benefit or cost components of our pension plans, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the amount includes dividends received on Comcast common stock we owned through January 24, 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Altice USA recorded a tax benefit (expense) of 9,892 and (42,045) on pre-tax income (loss) of (50,727) and 10,016, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the increase in tax deficiencies on share-based compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory rate, due to increased state tax expense, primarily from a discrete adjustment of 19,472 from the enacted corporate tax rate increase in New Jersey. In addition, the higher rate for the nine month period is due to the impact of certain non-deductible expenses and tax deficiencies on share-based compensation. 

43 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Altice USA recorded a tax expense of 27,336 and 106,433 on pre-tax income of 102,851 and 299,262, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The higher tax rate was due to the impact of certain non-deductible expenses, state tax expense, and tax deficiencies on share-based compensation.

CSC HOLDINGS RESTRICTED GROUP 
 For financing purposes, CSC Holdings is structured as a restricted group (the "Restricted Group") and an unrestricted group, which includes certain designated subsidiaries and investments (the "Unrestricted Group"). The Restricted Group is comprised of CSC Holdings and substantially all of its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries. These Restricted Group subsidiaries are subject to the covenants and restrictions of the CSC Holdings credit facility and indentures governing the notes issued by CSC Holdings. 
 Presented below is financial information that reflects a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Altice USA has no operations independent of its subsidiaries. Funding for our subsidiaries has generally been provided by cash flow from their respective operations, cash on hand and borrowings under the CSC Holdings revolving credit facility and the proceeds from the issuance of securities and borrowings under syndicated term loans in the capital markets. Our decision as to the use of cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facility or accessing the capital markets has been based upon an ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, the timing of cash flow generation and the cost of borrowing under the revolving credit facility, debt securities and syndicated term loans. We calculate net leverage ratios for our CSC Holdings Restricted Group and Lightpath debt silos as net debt to L2QA EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA for the two most recent consecutive fiscal quarters multiplied by 2.0). 
 We expect to utilize Free Cash Flow and availability under the CSC Holdings Restricted Group and Lightpath revolving credit facilities, as well as future refinancing transactions, to further extend the maturities of, or reduce the principal on, our debt obligations. The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to, among other factors, market conditions. Additionally, we may, from time to time, depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from other borrowings to repay the outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers, exchange offers or redemptions, or engage in similar transactions. 
 We believe existing cash balances, operating cash flows and availability under the CSC Holdings Restricted Group and Lightpath revolving credit facilities will provide adequate funds to support our current operating plan, make planned capital expenditures and fulfill our debt service requirements for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our operations, make planned capital expenditures, make scheduled payments on our indebtedness and repay our indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and cash flows and our ability to access the capital markets, which, in turn, are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Competition, market disruptions or a deterioration in economic conditions could lead to lower demand for our products, as well as lower levels of advertising, and increased incidence of customers' inability to pay for the services we provide. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Although we currently believe amounts available under the CSC Holdings Restricted Group and Lightpath revolving credit facilities will be available when, and if, needed, we can provide no assurance that access to such funds will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets or other conditions. The obligations of the financial institutions under the revolving credit facilities are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. 
 In the longer term, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund anticipated capital expenditures, meet all existing future contractual payment obligations and repay our debt at maturity. As a result, we could be dependent upon our continued access to the capital and credit markets to issue additional debt or equity or refinance existing debt obligations. We intend to raise significant amounts of funding over the next several years to fund capital expenditures, repay existing obligations and meet other obligations, and the failure to do so successfully could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to do so, we will need to take other actions including deferring capital expenditures, selling assets, seeking strategic investments from third parties or reducing discretionary uses of cash.

 For financing purposes, we have two debt silos: CSC Holdings and Lightpath. The CSC Holdings silo is structured as a restricted group (the "CSC Holdings Restricted Group") and an unrestricted group, which includes certain designated subsidiaries and investments. The CSC Holdings Restricted Group is comprised of CSC Holdings and substantially all of its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries excluding Lightpath which became an unrestricted subsidiary in September 2020. These CSC Holdings Restricted Group subsidiaries are subject to the covenants and restrictions of the credit facility and indentures governing the notes issued by CSC Holdings. The Lightpath silo includes all of its operating subsidiaries which are subject to the covenants and restrictions of the credit facility and indentures governing the notes issued by Lightpath.

CSC Holdings Restricted Group 
 Sources of cash for the CSC Holdings Restricted Group include primarily cash flow from the operations of the businesses in the CSC Holdings Restricted Group, borrowings under its credit facility and issuance of securities in the capital markets, contributions from its parent, and, from time to time, distributions or loans from its subsidiaries. The CSC Holdings Restricted Group's principal uses of cash include: capital spending, in particular, the capital requirements associated with the upgrade of its digital broadband, video and telephony services, including costs to build our FTTH network; debt service; other corporate expenses and changes in working capital; and investments that it may fund from time to time. 
 CSC Holdings Credit Facility 
 In October 2015, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altice USA, which merged with and into CSC Holdings on June 21, 2016, entered into a senior secured credit facility, which provides U.S. dollar term loans (the "CSC Term Loan B"), and U.S. dollar revolving loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of 2,475,000 1,700,000 outstanding at September 30, 2024) (the "CSC Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the CSC Term Loan B, the "CSC Credit Facilities"), which are governed by a credit facilities agreement entered into by, inter alios, CSC Holdings, certain lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and security agent (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "CSC Credit Facilities Agreement"). The CSC Term Loan B was repaid during the three months ended March 31, 2024 with proceeds from the issuance of senior guaranteed notes in January 2024. 
 In October 2018, CSC Holdings entered into a 1,275,000 incremental term loan facility (the Incremental Term Loan B-3 which was repaid during the three months ended March 31, 2024 with proceeds from the issuance of senior guaranteed notes in January 2024. In October 2019, CSC Holdings entered into a 3,000,000 2,865,000 outstanding at September 30, 2024) incremental term loan facility ("Incremental Term Loan B-5") and in December 2022, CSC Holdings entered into a 2,001,942 1,971,913 outstanding at September 30, 2024) incremental term loan facility (the "Incremental Term Loan B-6") under its CSC Credit Facilities Agreement. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, CSC Holdings borrowed 1,825,000 under the CSC Revolving Credit Facility and repaid 950,000 of amounts outstanding under the CSC Revolving Credit Facility. 
 At September 30, 2024, 157,988 of the CSC Revolving Credit Facility was restricted for certain letters of credit issued on our behalf and 617,012 was undrawn and available, subject to covenant limitations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, CSC Holdings was in compliance with applicable financial covenants under its credit facility. 
 See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the CSC Credit Facilities Agreement. 
 CSC Holdings Senior Guaranteed Notes and Senior Notes 
 In January 2024, CSC Holdings issued 2,050,000 in aggregate principal amount of senior guaranteed notes due 2029. These notes bear interest at a rate of 11.750 and will mature on January 31, 2029. The proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to (i) repay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan B, (ii) repay the outstanding principal balance of the Incremental Term Loan B-3, and (iii) pay the fees, costs and expenses associated with these transactions. 
 In February 2024, we redeemed the CSC Holdings 5.250 Senior Notes and 5.250 Series B Senior Notes due June 2024 with proceeds under the CSC Revolving Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, CSC Holdings was in compliance with applicable financial covenants under each respective indenture by which the senior guaranteed notes and senior notes were issued. 
 Lightpath 
 Sources of cash for Lightpath include existing cash balances, operating cash flows from its operating subsidiaries and availability under the revolving credit facility. 
 Lightpath Credit Facility 
 Lightpath is party to a credit agreement which provides a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of 600,000 577,500 outstanding at September 30, 2024) and revolving loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of 
 48 

115,000. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Lightpath revolving credit facility. 
 In February 2024, Lightpath entered into an extension amendment (the "Extension Amendment") to its amended credit agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement") that provides for, among other things, (a) an extension of the scheduled maturity date with respect to the 2027 Revolving Credit Commitments (as defined in the Extension Amendment) under the credit agreement to the date (the "New Maturity Date") that is the later of (x) November 30, 2025 and (y) the earlier of (i) June 15, 2027 and (ii) the date that is five business days after any Extension Breach Date (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and (b) incremental revolving credit commitments in an aggregate principal amount of 15,000 which shall be of the same class and type as the 2027 Revolving Credit Commitments and will, for the avoidance of doubt, mature on the New Maturity Date. After giving effect to the Extension Amendment, the aggregate principal amount of revolving loan commitments available under the Amended Credit Agreement equaled 115,000. 
 Under the Extension Amendment, the aggregate principal amount of 2027 Revolving Credit Commitments equaled 95,000 and the aggregate principal amount of 2025 Revolving Credit Commitments (as defined in the Extension Amendment) equaled 20,000. Interest will be calculated at a rate per annum equal to the adjusted Term SOFR rate or the alternate base rate, as applicable, plus the applicable margin, where the applicable margin is (i) with respect to any alternate base rate loan, 2.25 per annum and (ii) with respect to any Term SOFR loan, 3.25 per annum. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Lightpath was in compliance with applicable financial covenants under its credit agreement and with applicable financial covenants under each respective indenture by which its senior secured notes and senior notes were issued. 
 See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the above debt obligations. 
 Fair Value of Debt 
 At September 30, 2024, the fair value of our fixed rate debt, comprised of our senior guaranteed and senior secured notes, senior notes, supply chain financing, and notes payable of 13,178,608 was lower than its carrying value of 17,832,643 by 4,654,035. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these securities. Our floating rate borrowings, comprised of our term loans and revolving credit facilities bear interest in reference to current SOFR-based market rates and thus their principal values approximate fair value. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at September 30, 2024 would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by 502,474 to 13,681,082. This estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 To manage interest rate risk, we have from time to time entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and/or effectively convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to permit us to realize lower interest expense in a declining interest rate environment. We monitor the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and we only enter into interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions that are rated investment grade. All such contracts are carried at their fair market values on our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at September 30, 2024 . Our outstanding interest rate swap contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap contracts are recorded through the statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recorded a gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts of (45,657) and 10,220. At September 30, 2024, one outstanding interest rate swap contract had a fair value of 4,691 recorded as other assets, long-term, and one outstanding interest rate swap contract had a fair value of 1,907 recorded as other liabilities, long-term on the consolidated balance sheets . 
 In September 2024, we terminated all our CSC Holdings interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of 3,000,000. These contracts were due to mature in January 2025 and December 2026. In connection with these early terminations, we received cash of 43,182 presented in operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows and incurred a loss of 52,943 reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not hold and have not issued derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

 Storm Impact 
 In September 2024, the rain, wind and flooding from Hurricane Helene impacted our Western North Carolina service area, resulting in power outages and service disruptions to customers as well as damage to our cable network in the area. We are in the process of repairing the damage and working to restore service to our customers. We are currently unable to estimate the financial impact, but do not believe it will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
