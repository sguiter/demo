 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this report are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include references to our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, strategies, future performance, and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, plan, intend, believe, may, might, will, should, can have, and likely and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. For example, all statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, revenues, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates, and financial results, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth, initiatives, or strategies, or the expected outcome or impact of pending or threatened litigation are forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected, including: 
 possible inability to successfully implement our long-term strategic plans, including Project Restoration; 
 possible declines in our comparable sales; 
 possible inability to maintain and enhance our brands; 
 possible failure of our multi-channel distribution model; 
 possible adverse changes in general economic conditions and their impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, including political unrest, social unrest, acts of war and terrorism, and other related matters; 
 possible inability to predict and respond in a timely manner to changes in consumer demand; 
 possible inability to successfully open new stores and/or operate current stores as planned; 
 possible loss of key management or design associates or inability to attract and retain the talent required for our business; 
 possible data security or privacy breaches or disruptions in our computer systems or websites; 
 possible disruptions in our supply chain; 
 possible new or increased tariffs on our products and increases in inbound and outbound freight expense that could lead to increased product costs and lower profit margins; and 
 public health pandemics and actions by governmental or other actors regarding containment. 
 We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating plans and forecasts, which are based upon detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. 
 For a discussion of the above described risks and uncertainties and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements, please refer to Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, as well as in Item 1A herein. 
 We caution you that the risks and uncertainties identified by us may not be all of the factors that are important to you. Furthermore, the forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

 interest in Creative Genius, Inc., which also operates under the name Pura Vida Bracelets Pura Vida ). On January 30, 2023, the Company purchased the remaining interest in Pura Vida. Pura Vida, based in La Jolla, California, is a digitally native lifestyle brand that we believe deeply resonates with its loyal consumer following. The Pura Vida brand has a differentiated and expanding offering of bracelets, jewelry, and other lifestyle accessories. 
 The Company has reportable segments: Vera Bradley Direct VB Direct ), Vera Bradley Indirect VB Indirect ), and Pura Vida. 
 The VB Direct segment consists of sales of Vera Bradley products through Vera Bradley full-line and outlet stores in the United States; e-commerce sites (verabradley.com, outlet.verabradley.com, and international.verabradley.com); and the Vera Bradley annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana. As of November 2, 2024, the Company operated full-line stores and outlet stores. 
 The VB Indirect segment consists of revenues generated through the distribution of Vera Bradley-branded products to specialty retailers representing approximately locations, substantially all of which are located in the United States; key accounts, which include department stores, national accounts, third-party e-commerce sites, and third-party inventory liquidators; and royalties recognized through licensing agreements related to the Vera Bradley brand. 
 The Pura Vida segment represents revenues generated through the Pura Vida websites (www.puravidabracelets.com and www.puravidabracelets.eu); through the distribution of Pura Vida-branded products to wholesale retailers, substantially all of which are located in the United States; and through its seven retail stores. 
 The interim financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the results for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The results of operations for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year due to, in part, seasonal fluctuations in the business and the uncertainty of macroeconomic factors on future periods, including inflation and other related matters..

 (1) Cash equivalents primarily represent a money market fund that has a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. Due to the short maturity, the Company believes the carrying value approximates fair value. 
 The Company assesses potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which includes property, plant, and equipment and lease right-of-use assets, on a quarterly basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Store-level assets and right-of-use assets are grouped at the individual store-level for the purpose of the impairment assessment. Recoverability of an asset group is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is rec ognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. The fair value of the store assets is determined using the discounted future cash flow method of anticipated cash flows through the store s lease-end date using fair value measurement inputs classified as Level 3. The fair value of right-of-use assets is estimated using market comparative information for similar properties. Level 3 inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. The Company recorded million for store property, plant, and equipment charges for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024. These charges are included in selling, general, and administrative ("SG A") expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. There were long-lived asset impairment charges for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. 
 The discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective. Changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates. The estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include: (1) estimated future cash flow generated at the store level; (2) discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values; and (3) market rentals at the retail store. These and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and our expectations and may change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances. If economic conditions were to deteriorate, future impairment charges may be required which may be material. 
 On a nonrecurring basis, assets recognized or disclosed at fair value on the consolidated financial statements include items such as property, plant, and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and operating lease assets, as well as intangible assets related to the Pura Vida acquisition. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 or October 28, 2023. Refer to Note 13 herein for additional information.

The Company may avoid certain of such restrictions by meeting payment conditions defined in the Credit Agreement.

 operating segments, which are also its reportable segments: VB Direct, VB Indirect, and Pura Vida. These operating segments are components of the Company for which separate financial information is available and for which operating results are evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the performance of the segments. 
 The VB Direct segment includes Vera Bradley full-line and outlet stores; e-commerce sites (verabradley.com, outlet.verabradley.com, and international.verabradley.com); and the Vera Bradley annual outlet sale. Revenues generated from this segment are driven through the sale of Vera Bradley-branded products from Vera Bradley to end consumers. 
 The VB Indirect segment represents revenues generated through the distribution of Vera Bradley-branded products to specialty retailers representing approximately locations, substantially all of which are located in the United States; key accounts, which include department stores, national accounts, third-party e-commerce sites, and third-party inventory liquidators; and royalties recognized through licensing agreements related to the Vera Bradley brand. 
 The Pura Vida segment represents revenues generated through the Pura Vida websites (www.puravidabracelets.com and www.puravidabracelets.eu) ; through the distribution of Pura Vida-branded products to wholesale retailers, substantially all of which are located in the United States; and through the Pura Vida retail stores. 
 Corporate costs represent the Company s administrative expenses, which include, but are not limited to: human resources, legal, finance, information technology, design, product development, merchandising, corporate-level marketing and advertising, and various other corporate-level-activity-related expenses not directly attributable to a reportable segment. All intercompany-related activities are eliminated in consolidation and are excluded from the segment reporting.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the condensed consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows of the Company as of and for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. The results of operations for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. 
 Strategic Progress, Macroeconomic Factors, and Other Factors Impacting our Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Strategic Progress. We launched the first of our customer-facing stages of Project Restoration in July of fiscal 2025, which included new products, store remodels, website redesigns, and customer marketing. Project Restoration is focused on four key pillars of the business (Consumer, Brand, Product, and Channel) for each brand to help drive long-term profitable growth. 
 
 In addition, we continued to identify cost reductions as part of our overall plan to right-size the expense structure of our Company and lay the groundwork for success to help drive long-term profitable growth. Savings are being derived across various areas of the Company, including retail store efficiencies, marketing expenses, information technology contracts, professional services, logistics and operational costs, and corporate payroll. We will continue to review our expense structure for additional cost reduction opportunities. 
 
 Macroeconomic and Other Factors . We continue to be impacted by higher tariffs from previously duty-free countries, where we source products, as a result of the expiration of the Generalized System of Preferences GSP duty-free status at the end of calendar year 2020. In addition, the macroeconomic environment has been further challenged by inflationary pressures and other related factors that have impacted consumer discretionary spending. We continued to see weakness in both the Vera Bradley outlet store business and full line stores in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 How We Assess the Performance of Our Business 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. 
 Net Revenues 
 Net revenues reflect sales of our merchandise and revenue from distribution and shipping and handling fees, less returns and discounts. Revenues for the VB Direct segment reflect sales through Vera Bradley full-line and outlet stores; e-commerce sites (verabradley.com, outlet.verabradley.com, and international.verabradley.com); and the Vera Bradley annual outlet sale. Revenues for the VB Indirect segment reflect sales of Vera Bradley-branded products to specialty retail partners; key accounts consisting of department stores, national accounts, third-party e-commerce sites, and third-party inventory liquidators; and royalties recognized through licensing agreements related to the Vera Bradley brand. Revenues for the Pura Vida segment reflect revenues generated through the Pura Vida websites (www.puravidabracelets.com and www.puravidabracelets.eu); through the distribution of Pura Vida-branded products to wholesale retailers; and through Pura Vida retail stores. 
 Comparable Sales 
 C omparable sales are calculated based upon our stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months and net revenues from our Vera Bradley e-commerce operations. Remodeled stores are included in both comparable sales and comparable store sales unless the store was closed for more than one week of the current or comparable prior period, in which case the non-comparable temporary closure periods are not included, or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage. Some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales differently than we do. As a result, data in this report regarding our comparable sales and comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies. Non-comparable sales include sales from stores not included in comparable sales or comparable store sales. 
 Measuring the change in year-over-year comparable sales allows us and our investors to evaluate how our store base and e-commerce operations are performing. Various factors affect our comparable sales, including: 
 Overall economic trends; 
 Consumer preferences and fashion trends; 
 Competition;

 The timing of our releases of new patterns and collections; 
 Changes in our product mix; 
 Pricing, as well as timing and level of promotions; 
 Amount of store, mall, and e-commerce traffic; 
 The level of customer service that we provide in stores and to our on-line customers; 
 Our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; 
 The number of stores we open and close in any period; and 
 The timing and success of promotional and marketing efforts. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit is equal to our net revenues less our cost of sales. Cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise, distribution center costs, operations overhead, duties, all inbound freight costs incurred, and inventory adjustments, if any. The components of our reported cost of sales may not be comparable to those of other retail and wholesale companies. 
 Gross profit can be impacted by changes in volume; fluctuations in sales price; inbound freight and other logistical costs; operational efficiencies, such as leveraging of fixed costs; promotional activities, including free shipping; commodity prices, such as for cotton; tariffs; and labor costs. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses SG A 
 SG A expenses include selling; advertising, marketing, and product development; and administrative expenses. Selling expenses include: 
 VB Direct business expenses, such as store expenses, employee compensation, and store occupancy and supply costs; 
 VB Indirect business expenses consisting primarily of employee compensation and other expenses associated with sales to Indirect retailers; and 
 Pura Vida business expenses primarily related to employee compensation and store expenses. 
 Advertising, marketing, and product development expenses include employee compensation, media costs, creative production expenses, marketing agency fees, new product design costs, public relations expenses, and market research expenses. Administrative expenses include employee compensation for corporate functions, corporate headquarters occupancy costs, consulting and software expenses, and charitable donations, as well as severance charges and consulting fees associated with cost savings initiatives disclosed in Note 14 to the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein. 
 Operating (Loss) Income 
 Operating (loss) income is equal to gross profit less SG A expenses plus other income, net. Operating (loss) income excludes interest income, interest expense, and income taxes. 
 Net (Loss) Income 
 Net (loss) income is equal to operating (loss) income plus interest income less interest expense and income taxes. 
 Impairment Charges 
 Intangible Assets 
 We perform our annual impairment test of the indefinite-lived Pura Vida brand during the second quarter of each fiscal year. 
 
 Refer to Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements filed with the SEC on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, for additional information regarding the indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test and impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2024. There were no impairment charges recorded during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 or October 28, 2023. Depending on the results of future impairment tests, it is possible additional impairments could be identified in future periods, and such amounts could be material.

Table of Contents 

 Long-lived Assets 
 Property, plant, and equipment and lease right-of-use assets (the asset group for store-related assets) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. The reviews are conducted at the lowest identifiable level of cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset group are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, as further defined in Note 5 to the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Impairment charges of 2.2 million were recognized during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, for store property, plant, and equipment charges, which are included in SG A expenses within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and within impairment charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 2.1 million of the impairment charge is included in the Direct segment, and 0.1 million is included in the Pura Vida segment for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024. There were no impairment charges recorded during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. We are unable to predict the extent of the impact that the inflationary environment could have on our operations, the economy, or other factors; therefore, it is possible additional impairments could be identified in future periods, and such amounts could be material.

 VB Direct . For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, net revenues in the VB Direct segment decreased 19.8 million, or 27.4 , to 52.5 million, from 72.3 million in the comparable prior-year period. Vera Bradley comparable sales decreased 27.2 , which includes a 32.6 decrease in comparable store sales and a 17.5 decrease in e-commerce sales. In addition, non-comparable store revenue decreased 0.5 million. The decrease in comparable sales and comparable store sales was primarily due to reduced traffic, conversion, and units sold in the e-commerce, full-line, and outlet channels. 
 VB Indirect . For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, net revenues in the VB Indirect segment decreased 7.0 million, or 27.9 , to 18.0 million, from 25.0 million in the comparable prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in specialty and key account orders, as well as a decrease in liquidation sales. 
 Pura Vida. For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, net revenues in the Pura Vida segment decreased 7.6 million, or 42.9 , to 10.1 million, from 17.7 million in the comparable prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in e-commerce and wholesale sales. 
 Gross Profit 
 For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, gross profit decreased 19.4 million, or 30.8 , to 43.6 million, from 63.0 million in the comparable prior-year period. As a percentage of net revenues, gross profit decreased to 54.1 for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, from 54.8 in the comparable prior-year period. Current year gross margin was negatively impacted by sales channel mix as well as an increase in outbound freight costs. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, SG A expenses decreased 2.2 million, or 3.8 , to 54.2 million, from 56.4 million in the comparable prior-year period.

SG A expenses related to Pura Vida were 7.9 million compared to 11.4 million in the comparable prior-year period. For the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, consolidated SG A expenses decreased primarily due to a 3.1 million reduction in employee-related costs, including lower variable compensation and reduced headcount; 0.8 million selling expense reduction resulting from sales decreases as described above; and 0.7 million intangible asset amortization in the prior-year period that did not occur in the current-year period. These decreases were partially offset by 2.2 million of property, plant, and equipment impairment charges in the current year period.

 For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, net other income decreased 0.1 million to 0.7 million, from 0.8 million in the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in net other income was primarily due to ticket sales from the Vera Bradley annual outlet sale.

The decrease in operating income as a percentage of VB Direct segment net revenues was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues as described above, SG A expense deleverage associated with decreased sales, as well as property, plant, and equipment charges of 2.1 million. 
 VB Indirect . For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, operating income in the VB Indirect segment decreased 5.3 million, or 26.4 , to 14.6 million from 19.9 million in the comparable prior-year period.

 Corporate Unallocated . For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, unallocated expenses decreased 5.9 million, or 10.6 , to 49.4 million from 55.3 million in the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in unallocated expenses was primarily due to a 6.3 million reduction in employee-related costs, including lower variable compensation, reduced headcount, and decrease in severance charges compared to the prior-year period, as well as a 0.8 million reduction in professional fees. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in advertising spend of 0.8 million primarily related to Project Restoration initiatives and 0.4 million of net other expenses. 
 Income Tax (Benefit) Expense 
 The effective tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, was 15.3 , compared to 28.3 for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023.

 Net (Loss) Income 
 For the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, there was a net loss of (15.2) million, a 24.9 million decrease, from net income of 9.7 million in the comparable prior-year period due to the factors described in the captions above. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash equivalents, as well as cash flow from operations. We also have access to additional liquidity, if needed, through borrowings under our 75.0 million asset-based revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ). There was no debt outstanding as of November 2, 2024. Historically, our primary cash needs have been for merchandise inventories; payroll; store rent; capital expenditures associated with operational equipment, buildings, information technology, and opening new stores; and share repurchases. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities. 
 
 We believe that cash on hand and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities, and the availability of borrowings under our Credit Agreement or other financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures, and other strategic uses of cash, if any, for the foreseeable future. 
 Cash Flow Analysis 
 A summary of operating, investing, and financing activities is shown in the following table (in thousands): Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (35,757) 21,058 Net cash used in investing activities (6,050) (12,546) Net cash used in financing activities (21,871) (2,872) 
 Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities consists primarily of net (loss) income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation; and the effect of changes in assets and liabilities. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 was 35.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 21.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily related to a net loss of (15.2) million, a 24.9 million decrease, from net income in the comparable prior-year period, a change in deferred income taxes of 3.3 million, 1.6 million in other non-cash items, partially offset by a 2.2 million impairment charge in the current year period. Additionally, there was a change in assets and liabilities of 29.2 million, primarily driven by an increase in inventory receipts in the current year period. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Investing activities consist primarily of investments and capital expenditures related to new store openings, buildings, operational equipment, and information technology investments. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 6.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 12.5 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was a result of the purchase of the remaining 25 interest in Pura Vida for 10.0 million in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in property, plant, and equipment spending of 3.5 million primarily as a result of Vera Bradley outlet new store openings in the current year as well as Project Restoration initiatives. 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 21.9 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 compared to 2.9 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to 21.2 million of common stock repurchases in the current-year period compared to 1.9 million in the comparable prior-year period.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
