. The estimated annualized future cost savings from the reduction in force is approximately 4.3 million, which is expected to contribute to the goal of decreasing loss and achieving cash-flow breakeven. The Company will incur pre-tax charges of approximately 0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 representing, for the most part, one -time cash expenditures for severance and other employee termination benefits. In addition to the reduction in force, the Company has eliminated bonuses in 2024, reduced the board of directors from eight to five members and reduced board cash compensation from 0.5 million annually to approximately million. 
 
 In addition to the organizational changes, the Company has identified other direct cost savings it anticipates achieving in 2025. The identified cost savings include reductions in professional fees, lower research and development costs as we complete the development of Ayon, credit card fees and stock-based compensation. The Company foresees, in totality, these cost savings will reduce our annual operating expenses below 40 million.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the effective rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to interest income on the Company's income tax refund that it received during the quarter, partially offset by the full valuation allowance recorded on the NOL generated during the period.

 During March 2024, the Company was named as a defendant in a number of product liability lawsuits filed under the direction of a single plaintiff s tort firm alleging off-label use of Renuvion products and the Company s mismarketing of the same. The suits are venued predominantly in Florida and nearly all involve procedures conducted prior to 2023, which was before the Company received FDA 510k clearance for the use of Renuvion in the types of procedures at issue. The Company denies liability and intends to vigorously defend these suits and believes that it has applicable substantive and procedural defenses.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 ITEM 2 . Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report and with the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 contained within our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 21, 2024. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report and those discussed in other documents we file with the SEC. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements represent beliefs and assumptions as of the date of this report. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements and at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 
 
 Executive Level Overview 
 
 We are an advanced energy technology company with a passion for elevating people s lives through innovative products, including our Helium Plasma Platform Technology products marketed and sold as Renuvion in the cosmetic surgery market and J-Plasma in the hospital surgical market. Renuvion and J-Plasma offer surgeons a unique ability to provide controlled heat to tissue to achieve their desired results. We also leverage our deep expertise and decades of experience in unique waveforms through OEM agreements with other medical device manufacturers. 
 
 We operate in two business segments: OEM and Advanced Energy. The OEM segment is primarily development and manufacturing contract and product driven. The Advanced Energy segment sells both capital equipment and consumables in the form of a single use handpiece. Sales of handpiece units are a substantial portion of our business and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold approximately 64,000 and 59,000 units, respectively. In the third quarter, our handpiece revenue grew 9 overall and 15 in the United States and handpiece revenue now accounts for more than 60 of our total Advanced Energy revenue. 
 
 Recent activities: 
 
 Glucagon- like peptide -1 peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1 s), such as Mounjaro , Wegovy and Ozempic , are prescribed for the treatment of diabetes and or weight loss in combination with exercise to improve glycemic control. GLP-1 s have also been found to mimic the GLP-1 satiety hormone in our bodies. When one eats, GLP-1 is released in the small intestines regulating blood sugar and sending signals to the brain centers that control appetite. Studies have shown patients taking GLP-1 s have experienced a loss of body weight. Currently, two GLP-1 s are cleared by the FDA for weight loss, but we anticipate a number of additional drug candidates will be cleared as well as, oral versions of these injectable medications. 
 
 We believe the increased use of GLP-1 s may have had an initial negative impact on the number of liposuction procedures and created uncertainty in the aesthetic space. However, we believe, as these drugs will have a ripple effect that will eventually drive people towards plastic surgery and will provide a tailwind for sales of our Renuvion products. Rapid weight loss caused by these drugs can contribute to loose skin, particularly in the curvier areas of the body. To address this, the cosmetic surgery market is focusing on body contouring. Body contouring is a customizable treatment for patients to target specific fat deposits, engage in fat transfer, and treatments to address loose or lax skin. Renuvion is the only FDA approved device for the treatment of this issue post liposuction. Additionally, Renuvion may be used to treat skin laxity without the use of liposuction, potentially increasing the total available market for our products.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued

Liquidity: 
 
 We have incurred recurring net losses and cash outflows from operations and we anticipate that losses will continue in the near term. We plan to continue to fund our operations and capital funding needs through existing cash, sales of our products and, if necessary, additional equity and/or debt financing. However, we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, financing will be obtained on terms acceptable to us. The sale of additional equity would result in dilution to our stockholders. Incurring additional debt financing would result in further debt service obligations, and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our sales, marketing and product development. Any of these actions could harm our business, results of operations and prospects. In November 2024, we undertook a cost saving restructuring which included an organizational reduction in force to better focus, optimize and streamline operations. As a result of the organizational changes, we reduced our workforce by nearly 25 . We estimate the annualized future cost savings from the reduction in force to be approximately 4.3 million which we expect to contribute to our goal of decreasing loss and achieving cash-flow breakeven. We will incur pre-tax charges of approximately 0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 representing, for the most part, one-time cash expenditures for severance and other employee termination benefits. In addition, to the reduction in force, we have eliminated bonuses in 2024, reduced the board of directors from eight to five members and reduced board cash compensation from 0.5 million annually to 0.1 million. 
 
 In addition to the organizational changes, we have identified other direct cost savings we anticipate achieving in 2025. The identified cost savings include reductions in professional fees, lower research and development costs as we complete the development of Ayon, credit card fees and stock-based compensation. We foresee, in totality, these cost savings will reduce our annual operating expenses below 40 million in 2025. 
 
 In regards to our operating segments, our results are aggregated into reportable segments only if they exhibit similar economic characteristics. In addition to similar economic characteristics, we also consider the following factors in determining the reportable segments: the nature of business activities, the management structure directly accountable to our chief operating decision maker for operating and administrative activities, availability of discrete financial information, and information presented to the Board of Directors and investors. Asset information is not reviewed by the chief operating decision maker by segment and is not available by segment and, accordingly, we have not presented a measure of assets by reportable segment. 
 
 Our reportable segments are disclosed as principally organized and managed as two operating segments: Advanced Energy and OEM. Corporate Other includes certain unallocated corporate and administrative costs which are not specifically attributed to any reportable segment. The OEM segment is primarily development and manufacturing contract and product driven, and all related expenses are recorded as cost of sales, therefore no segment specific operating expenses are incurred. 
 
 We strongly encourage investors to visit our website: www.apyxmedical.com to view the most current news and to review our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Total revenue decreased by 4.1 , or approximately 0.5 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. Advanced Energy segment sales decreased 5.6 , or approximately 0.5 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Advanced Energy sales decrease was driven by a lower average selling price of generators to domestic customers, fewer domestic customer upgrades to the Apyx One Console and a decrease in international sales of new generators. These decreases were partially offset by an increased volume of single-use handpieces domestically and sales of upgrades to the Apyx One Console internationally. OEM segment sales increased 2.8 , or approximately 0.1 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in OEM sales was due to increases in sales volume to existing customers, including Symmetry Surgical under our 10-year generator manufacturing and supply agreement. 
 
 Total revenue decreased by 10.1 , or approximately 3.8 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Advanced Energy segment sales decreased 15.2 , or approximately 4.7 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Advanced Energy sales decrease was driven by lower sales of our generators in both domestic and some international markets as a result of economic uncertainty in the capital equipment market that is being experienced in the aesthetic space and a lower average selling price of generators to domestic customers as a result of this market. These decreases were partially offset by increased volume of single-use handpieces globally and sales of Apyx One Console upgrades internationally. OEM segment sales increased 14.5 , or approximately 0.9 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in OEM sales was due to increases in sales volume to existing customers, including Symmetry Surgical under our 10-year generator manufacturing and supply agreement. 
 
 International sales represented approximately 32.2 and 30.8 of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared with 27.8 and 26.6 of total revenues for the same period in the prior year. Management estimates our products have been sold in more than 60 countries through local dealers coordinated by sales and marketing personnel through our facilities in Clearwater, Florida and Sofia, Bulgaria.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 28.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to approximately 43.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023. Our working capital at September 30, 2024 was approximately 42.6 million compared with 57.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was approximately 15.1 million, which principally funded our loss from operations of 15.8 million, compared with net cash used in operating activities, exclusive of the receipt of our 8.1 million final income tax refund, of approximately 11.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in operations is primarily due to the payment of accrued bonuses in the first quarter of 2024, no bonuses were paid in 2023, higher cash interest expense, net of interest income, and the increase in operating loss driven by lower Advanced Energy sales compared to the same period in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by improvements in our accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and inventory positions. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.5 million related to investments in property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 6.8 million related to proceeds from the sale of our Clearwater, FL facility 7.3 million), partially offset by investments in property and equipment 0.4 million). 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 8.3 million and was primarily related to proceeds received upon the execution of the prior debt agreement 9.9 million) less debt issuance costs incurred in the transaction 1.8 million). This prior debt was paid off in November 2023 with proceeds from the Perceptive Credit Agreement. 
 
 We have incurred recurring net losses and cash outflows from operations and we anticipate that losses will continue in the near term. We plan to continue to fund our operations and capital funding needs through existing cash, sales of our products and if necessary additional equity and/or debt financing. However, we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, financing will be obtained on terms acceptable to us. The sale of additional equity would result in dilution to our stockholders. Incurring additional debt financing would result in further debt service obligations, and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our sales, marketing and product development. Any of these actions could harm our business, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 On November 22, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement providing us the ability to register and sell our securities in the aggregate amount up to 100 million. The shelf registration statement included an embedded ATM facility for up to 40 million. To date we have not utilized this facility. 
 
 On November 7, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Perceptive Credit Agreement. The amendment reduced the financial covenant trailing twelve-month revenue targets relating to its Advanced Energy segment (tested quarterly), with amended year-end targets of 34.4 million, 37.0 million, 52.4 million and 60.3 million for 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively, and a target of 38.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The amendment also introduced a maximum operating expense financial covenant, with full year targets of 40.0 million and 45.0 million for 2025 and 2026, respectively. The Perceptive Credit Agreement, as amended, continues to contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of us and our subsidiaries, among other things, to incur debt, grant liens, make distributions, enter certain restrictive agreements, pay or modify subordinated debt, dispose of assets, make investments and acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and undergo certain fundamental changes, in each case, subject to limitations and exceptions set forth in the Perceptive Credit Agreement. Additionally, we must maintain a balance of 3.0 million in cash and cash equivalents during the term of the Perceptive Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained within the Perceptive Credit Agreement, as amended. Our continued compliance with covenants is subject to meeting or exceeding forecasted Advanced Energy revenues, as amended and reducing operating expenses.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued

In connection with the amendment to the Perceptive Credit Agreement, we issued Perceptive 150,000 shares of our common stock. We are in the process of determining the proper accounting treatment for the amendment to the Perceptive Credit Agreement, including the issuance of the shares of common stock. 
 
 For a more in-depth description of the terms of the Perceptive Credit Agreement, as amended, see Note 11 in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 On November 7, 2024, we closed a 7.0 million registered direct offering with a healthcare-focused fund and issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,934,690 of prefunded warrants to purchase common stock with an exercise price of .001 per share. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had purchase commitments totaling approximately 2.7 million, substantially all of which is expected to be purchased within the next twelve months. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 In preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), we have adopted various accounting policies. Our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. 
 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions, including those related to inventories, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, legal proceedings, research and development, warranty obligations, product liability, sales returns and discounts, stock-based compensation and income taxes are updated as appropriate, which in most cases is at least quarterly. We base our estimates on historical experience, or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates. 
 
 Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and (2) other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Our critical accounting estimates include the following: 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 Under our stock option plans, options to purchase common shares may be granted to employees, officers and directors by our Board of Directors. We account for stock options in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation-Stock Compensation , with compensation expense recognized over the vesting period. Options are valued using the Black-Scholes model, which includes a number of estimates that affect the amount of our expense. We have determined that the most critical of these estimates are the estimates of expected life and volatility used in the calculations. 
 
 Expected life 
 
 For employee stock-based compensation awards, we estimate the expected life of awards utilizing the SEC's simplified method. We utilize this method, as we have not historically granted stock-based compensation awards to employees in sufficient volumes to determine a reasonable estimate of the life of awards. For awards granted to non-employees, we calculate expected life using a combination of past exercise behavior, the contractual term and expected remaining exercise behavior. 
 
 Volatility 
 
 We determine the volatility by utilizing the historical volatility of our stock over the period of the awards expected life. The SEC allows us to include periods in excess of the useful life if we determine that they provide a more reasonable basis for the volatility of our stock. Additionally, ASC 718-10 allows us to exclude periods from the volatility if they pertain to events or circumstances that in our judgment are specific to us and if the event or transaction is not reasonably expected to occur again during the expected term of the awards. We have not included any additional periods, nor disregarded any periods, in calculating our volatility.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued

Accounts Receivable Allowance 
 
 We maintain a reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, we analyze historical bad debt experience, the composition of outstanding receivables by customer class, and the age of outstanding balances, and we make estimates in connection with establishing the allowance for credit losses, including the expected impacts of changes in the operating environment and other trends. Changes in estimates are reflected in the period they are made. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. 
 
 Inventory Obsolescence Allowance 
 
 We maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause our products to become obsolete. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would unfavorably affect future operating results. 
 
 Litigation Contingencies 
 
 In accordance with authoritative guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded; actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted marginal tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period. 
 
 As a result of historical losses and our expectation to continue to generate losses in the near future, we recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. Exclusive of the carryback provisions of the CARES Act and the associated income tax benefit recognized in 2020, we do not anticipate recording an income tax benefit related to our deferred tax assets. We will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period and will be able to reduce the valuation allowance to the extent our results of operations improve, and it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. As management has not fully determined the timing of when it will generate taxable income in the U.S., we continued to record a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets balance as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We assess the financial statement impact of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merit of the position. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 The consequences of global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases and their adverse impact to the global economy, continue to evolve. Accordingly, the significance of the future impact to our business and financial statements remains subject to significant uncertainty. We continue to work on initiatives to combat inflation, including finding alternative suppliers that meet our quality standards, streamlining our supplier network to reduce the use of middlemen and redesigning some components to achieve better volume purchase prices. Inflation has not, to date, materially impacted our operations or financial performance. However, as these trends continue for raw materials, freight, and labor costs, our future financial performance could be adversely impacted.

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
