 Separate Account Liabilities 
 
 Separate account assets and liabilities consist of investment accounts established and maintained by the Company for certain variable contracts. Some of these variable contracts include minimum guarantees such as GMDBs that guarantee a minimum payment to the policyholder in the event of death. 
 The assets that support variable contracts are measured at fair value and are reported as separate account assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. An equivalent amount is reported as separate account liabilities. MRB assets and liabilities for minimum guarantees are valued and presented separately from separate account assets and separate account liabilities. MRBs are discussed further in the market risk benefits section of this Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Policy charges assessed against the policyholders for mortality, administration and other services are included in the life premiums and contract charges line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

The operating segments, representing the major lines of business, are: (1) Property Casualty (primarily personal lines of auto and property insurance products), (2) Life Retirement (primarily tax-qualified fixed and variable annuities as well as life insurance products), and (3) Supplemental Group Benefits (primarily cancer, heart, hospital, supplemental disability, accident, short-term and long-term group disability, and group term life coverages). The Company does not allocate the impact of corporate-level transactions to these operating segments, consistent with the basis for management's evaluation of the results of those segments, but classifies those items in the fourth reporting segment, Corporate Other. In addition to ongoing transactions such as corporate debt service, net investment gains (losses) and certain public company expenses, such items in Corporate Other have also included corporate debt retirement costs, when applicable.

 lawsuit and received various demands for reimbursement and notices of claims related to legacy, long-tail commercial lines claims, including asbestos, environmental, and sexual molestation claims. It is alleged that HMIC reinsured certain commercial lines policies as a member of various insurance pooling arrangements in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The related policies were written prior to the 1975 acquisition of Horace Mann by INA discussed in Part I - Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. HMEC s available records indicate that on January 1, 1975, HMIC entered a quota share retrocession treaty with INA. It is the Company s understanding that claims arising under these legacy policies were handled by various third parties pursuant to the terms of that treaty and its subsequent amendments entered into on behalf of HMIC. Ultimately, after amendments to the treaty and various corporate transactions involving the reinsurer, these obligations were assumed by companies that were affiliated with R Q Reinsurance Company (R Q). 
 The matters noted above arose following the March 23, 2023, Order of Liquidation in Pennsylvania of R Q. HMIC is defending itself against the pending litigation and is in the process of investigating and evaluating the other demands and claims notices under a complete reservation of rights. In addition, in order to preserve its rights, HMIC submitted a proof of claim in the pending R Q liquidation proceeding. 
 The amounts claimed against HMIC, if successful, could be material. However, based on the preliminary nature of the matters, the information available to date and considering the legal and factual challenges to the litigation and claims, it is not possible to provide a reasonable estimate of any resultant payment. 
 Investment Commitments 
 The Company has outstanding commitments to fund investments primarily in limited partnership interests. Such unfunded commitments were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Introduction 
 The purpose of this MD A is to provide an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This MD A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained in Part I - Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Measures within this MD A that are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (non-GAAP) are marked with an asterisk ) the first time they are presented within this Part I - Item 2. An explanation of these measures is contained in the Glossary of Selected Terms included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are reconciled to the most directly comparable measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) in the Appendix to the Company's Third Quarter 2024 Investor Supplement. 
 Increases or decreases in this MD A that are not meaningful are marked "N.M.". 
 Statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical in nature are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Horace Mann Educators Corporation (referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as "we", "our", "us", the "Company", "Horace Mann" or "HMEC") is an insurance holding company. We are not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaim any such obligation to) update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. It is important to note that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. Also, see Part I - Items 1 and 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding risks and uncertainties. 
 
 Corporate Strategy 
 Our vision is to be the company of choice to provide insurance and financial solutions for all educators and others who serve their communities, whether they engage with Horace Mann directly or through their district/employer. We believe the unique value of Horace Mann is providing solutions tailored for educators at each stage of their lives, empowering them to achieve lifelong financial success. Our motivation stems from our gratitude for educators: They are looking after our children's futures, and we believe they deserve someone to 
 Horace Mann Educators Corporation 35 
 Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 

look after theirs. Our commitment to having a positive impact on our customers' lives extends to all our corporate stakeholders, including employees, agents, investors and the communities where we live and work. 
 We conduct and manage our business in four reporting segments. The three reporting segments representing our major lines of business, are: (1) Property Casualty (primarily personal lines of auto and property insurance products), (2) Life Retirement (primarily tax-qualified fixed and variable annuities as well as life insurance products), and (3) Supplemental Group Benefits (primarily cancer, heart, hospital, supplemental disability, accident, short-term and long-term group disability, and group term life coverages). We do not allocate the impact of corporate-level transactions to these reporting segments, consistent with the basis for management's evaluation of the results of those segments, but classify those items in the fourth reporting segment, Corporate Other. In addition to ongoing transactions such as corporate debt service, net investment gains (losses) and certain public company expenses, such items also have included corporate debt retirement costs, when applicable. See Part I - Item 1, Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income increased 22.6 million and 59.1 million primarily due to improved Property Casualty segment results reflecting the effect of rate and non-rate underwriting actions as well as the impact of favorable prior years' reserve development and lower net investment losses in Corporate Other.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net premiums and contract charges earned increased 23.1 million and 62.6 million, as the Property Casualty segment continues to implement and earn in rate and other actions. 
 Net Investment Income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total net investment income decreased 5.9 million and 1.0 million. The decrease for the quarter is primarily due to lower returns for our limited partnership interests while the nine month variance is due to lower returns in our commercial mortgage loan funds in the first half of the year. The annualized investment yield on the portfolio excluding limited partnership interests was as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Investment yield, excluding limited partnership interests, pretax - annualized 
 4.8 4.5 4.5 4.6 Investment yield, excluding limited partnership interests, after tax - annualized 
 3.8 3.6 3.6 3.7 
 
 The higher investment yields, excluding limited partnership interests, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflected stronger income from the fixed income portfolios. The lower investment yield for nine months ended September 30, 2024 are due to commercial mortgage loan fund returns that were below historic averages in the first six months of 2024 significantly offset by the stronger income from the fixed income portfolio. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to identify and purchase investments with attractive risk-adjusted yields relative to market conditions without venturing into asset classes or individual securities that would be inconsistent with our overall investment guidelines for the core portfolio.

 Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 

We continue to fund at levels that allow us to maintain our targeted allocation to commercial mortgage loan funds and limited partnership interests while maintaining balance between principal protection and risk. 
 Net Investment Gains (Losses) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total net investment losses decreased by 12.2 million. For the nine months ended, September 30, 2024, net investment losses decreased 29.8 million. The breakdown of net investment gains (losses) by transaction type were as follows: 
 in millions) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Credit loss and intent-to-sell impairments (0.7) (0.6) (0.7) (7.2) Sales and other, net 0.1 (3.5) (3.2) (25.2) Change in fair value - equity securities 5.2 (1.4) 5.7 5.3 Change in fair value and gains (losses) realized on settlements - derivatives 
 (0.8) (2.9) (1.7) (2.6) Net investment gains (losses) 
 3.8 (8.4) 0.1 (29.7) 
 
 From time to time, we may sell fixed maturity securities subsequent to the reporting date that were considered temporarily impaired at such reporting date. Such sales are due to issuer-specific events occurring subsequent to the reporting date that result in a change in our intent to sell a fixed maturity security. 
 Other Income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income increased 5.8 million, due to lower offsets compared to the prior year from an indemnification agreement associated with the employer-sponsored business line and the impact of strong financial markets on asset based fees. 
 Benefits, Claims and Settlement Expenses 
 Benefits, claims and settlement expenses declined 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as lower property casualty underlying losses and recognition of favorable prior years' reserve development were partially offset by an increase in property catastrophe losses and life mortality. Benefits, claims and settlement expenses declined 12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the impact of favorable property casualty prior years' reserve development partially offset by an increase in life mortality. 
 Interest Credited 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest credited increased 2.1 million and 9.4 driven primarily by higher credited rates on the retained annuity block along with higher interest rates on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (FHLB). The net contribution from FHLB advances increased year over year as the higher interest credited rates were consistent with the higher earnings from the floating rate investments backing the program. 
 Under the deposit method of accounting, the interest credited on the reinsured annuity block continues to be reported. The average deferred annuity credited rate, excluding the reinsured annuity block, was 3.1 and 2.8 as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Operating Expenses 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses increased 9.5 and 6.3 , reflecting inflation and investments being made in infrastructure. 
 Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC) Amortization Expense 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, DAC amortization expense increased 1.8 million and 6.7 million, primarily due to premium increases in the Property Casualty segment driving higher DAC asset levels partially offset by lower levels of write-offs in the Life Retirement segment as annuity persistency has been stable in the current year. 
 Horace Mann Educators Corporation 38 
 Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 

Intangible Asset Amortization Expense 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, intangible asset amortization expense was flat. 
 Interest Expense 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 1.2 million and 5.0 million, due to an increase in the interest rate as well as an increase in the level of debt associated with the issuance of the 2023 Senior Notes. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The effective income tax rate on our pretax income, including net investment gains (losses), was 19.6 and 9.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income from investments in tax-advantaged securities decreased the effective income tax rates by 2.8 and 35.0 percentage points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We record liabilities for uncertain tax filing positions where it is more likely than not that the position will not be sustainable upon audit by taxing authorities. These liabilities are reevaluated routinely and are adjusted appropriately based on changes in facts or law. We have no unrecorded liabilities from uncertain tax filing positions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our federal income tax returns for years prior to 2020 are no longer subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. We do not anticipate any assessments for tax years that remain subject to examination to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. 
 
 Outlook for 2024 
 The following discussion provides forward-looking outlook information for our results of operations and capital position. 
 Consolidated Results 
 At the time of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we estimate that 2024 full year core earnings will be within a range of 2.40 to 2.70 per diluted share. This range is unchanged from the Outlook for 2024 we discussed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024. These results anticipate the following: 
 8 to 9 increase in net premiums and contract charges earned driven by Property Casualty rate actions 
 Net investment income in the range of 440 million to 450 million, which includes approximately 105 million of accreted investment income on the deposit asset on reinsurance in the Life Retirement segment 
 Approximately 6 increase in total Operating expense 
 Approximately 35 million in corporate Interest expense included in results for the Corporate Other segment 
 Property Casualty Segment 
 In 2024, net income for Property Casualty is anticipated to be in the range of 36 million to 39 million. Our outlook anticipates: 
 Combined ratio near 100 
 Catastrophe loss assumption is now anticipated to be around 13 of net earned premiums 
 We continue to anticipate achieving a Property Casualty combined ratio of 95-96 in 2025. 
 
 Horace Mann Educators Corporation 39 
 Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 

Life Retirement Segment 
 In 2024, net income for Life Retirement is estimated to be in the range of 50 million to 56 million. Our outlook anticipates: 
 Spread on the fixed annuity business in the range of 180 to 190 basis points, below the target range of 220 to 230 basis points 
 Mortality modestly higher than 2023 
 Supplemental Group Benefits Segment 
 In 2024, net income for Supplemental Group Benefits is anticipated to be in the range of 49 million to 52 million reflecting strong first-half performance. Our outlook anticipates: 
 Claims utilization for supplemental and disability products increasing slightly from the first nine months of the year, leading to a segment benefit ratio closer to longer-term target of 43 
 Pretax profit on revenue of between 21 and 22 
 As described in Application of Critical Accounting Estimates, certain of our significant accounting measurements require the use of estimates and assumptions. As additional information becomes available, adjustments may be required. Those adjustments are charged or credited to net income for the period in which the adjustments are made and may impact actual results compared to our estimates above. Additionally, see forward-looking information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as Part I - Items 1 and 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 concerning other important factors that could impact actual results. Our projections due not include a forecast of net investment gains (losses), which can vary substantially from one period to another and may have a significant impact on net income. 
 
 Application of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of our consolidated assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity and net income. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that subsequent events and available information may differ markedly from management's judgments at the time the consolidated financial statements were prepared. We have discussed with the Audit Committee the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles as applied in our financial reporting. The discussions generally included such matters as the consistency of our accounting policies and their application, and the clarity and completeness of our consolidated financial statements, which include related disclosures. 
 Information regarding our accounting policies pertaining to these topics is located in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II - Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, discussion of accounting policies, including certain sensitivity information, was presented in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Application of Critical Accounting Estimates in that Form 10-K within which we identified the following accounting estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability: 
 Valuation of hard-to-value fixed maturity securities 
 Evaluation of credit loss impairments for fixed maturity securities 
 Valuation of future policy benefit reserves 
 Valuation of liabilities for property and casualty unpaid claims and claim expense reserves 
 Compared to December 31, 2023, as of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to accounting policies for areas most subject to significant management judgments identified above.

Results of Operations by Segment 
 Consolidated financial results reflect the results of the Property Casualty, Life Retirement, and Supplemental Group Benefits reporting segments, as well as the Corporate Other reporting segment. These segments are defined based on financial information management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources. The following sections provide analysis and discussion of the results of operations for each of the reporting segments as well as investment results. 
 
 Property Casualty 

The Property Casualty segment primarily markets private passenger auto insurance and residential home insurance. Horace Mann offers standard auto coverages, including liability, collision and comprehensive. Property coverage includes both homeowners and renters policies. For both auto and property coverage, Horace Mann offers educators a discounted rate and the Educator Advantage package of features. The Property Casualty segment represented 46 of total revenues in 2023. 
 (All comparisons vs. same periods in 2023, unless noted otherwise) 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income reflected the following factors: 
 Three months ended: 
 Increases in average written premium per policy 
 Significantly lower underlying loss ratio 
 Favorable prior years' reserve development in auto and property 
 Lower net investment income driven by limited partnership portfolio 
 Nine months ended: 
 Increases in average written premium per policy 
 Significantly lower underlying loss ratio 
 Favorable prior years' reserve development in auto and property 
 Catastrophe losses lower than prior year 
 Higher net investment income driven by fixed income portfolios

 Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 

The Property Casualty segment three month net income of 10.6 million and nine month net income of 12.6 million, as well as the three month and nine month combined ratios of 97.9 and 103.1 , respectively, reflected the positive effect of rate and non-rate actions as well as positive prior years' reserve development. Net investment income for the three months of 2024 was 3.2 million lower driven by limited partnership portfolio returns while the nine month comparison was 4.0 million higher driven by the fixed income portfolio. 
 The current quarter reflects an increase in net premiums written of 12.7 , with average written premiums rising for both property and auto. Sales were strong for the quarter, up 27.8 from the prior year, and household retention remains stable. 
 The three and nine month loss ratios decreased 18.9 points and 14.3 points, respectively, from last year. In addition, 13.0 million and 19.2 million of net favorable prior years' reserve development for the three and nine months of 2024 reduced the loss ratio 6.9 and 3.6 points, respectively. Catastrophe losses for the quarter were 34.0 million, pretax, contributing 18.1 points to the combined ratio. In total, there were 20 events designated as catastrophes by Property Claims Services (PCS) in this year s third quarter. In the third quarter of 2023, catastrophe losses were 28.7 million, pretax, contributing 17.5 points to the combined ratio, from 25 PCS events. 
 The year-over-year increase in average written premiums for auto policies remained elevated in the third quarter at 16.4 , with retention declining slightly despite substantial rate increases. The third-quarter auto underlying loss ratio was 71.5 , improving 8.2 points from the prior year quarter, reflecting the benefit of rate and non-rate actions. The third quarter reported loss ratio benefited 6.7 points from favorable prior years' reserve development. 
 The year-over-year increase in average written premiums for property policies was 18.2 in the third quarter, as rate increases and inflation adjustments to coverage values continue to take effect and retention remains strong. The third-quarter property underlying loss ratio was 41.4 , a 20.4 point decrease from prior year reflecting the increase in average written premium and the elevated non-catastrophe weather losses in the prior year . 
 We continue to evaluate and implement actions to further mitigate our exposure and respond to rising weather trends. We are addressing the increased loss costs associated with the increased frequency of weather events in three ways: additional filed rate, product changes and enhanced modeling tools. 
 Horace Mann Educators Corporation 43 
 Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 

Life Retirement 
 The Life Retirement segment markets 403(b) tax-qualified fixed, fixed indexed and variable annuities; the Horace Mann Retirement Advantage open architecture platform for 403(b)(7) and other defined contribution plans; and other retirement products to educators as well as traditional term and whole life insurance products. Horace Mann is one of the largest participants in the K-12 educator portion of the 403(b) tax-qualified annuity market, measured by 403(b) net premiums written on a statutory accounting basis. The Life Retirement segment represented 36 of total revenues in 2023. 
 (All comparisons vs. same periods in 2023, unless noted otherwise) 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income reflected the following factors: 
 Annualized quarterly and nine month net interest spread on fixed annuities down 46 basis points and 59 basis points, respectively, due to higher interest credited rate on our retained block and lower returns on commercial mortgage loan funds during the first six months of 2024 
 Benefits expense in Retirement benefited from a favorable market risk benefit adjustment in the prior year quarter 
 Life mortality costs higher than prior year 
 Net spread from FHLB funding agreements remained stable year over year as net investment income reflected higher earnings from the floating rate investments backing the program and interest credited reflected offsetting higher interest expense

 Life Retirement segment net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 14.8 million and 38.8 million was down 29.2 and 25.8 , respectively, primarily due to a lower net interest spread and unfavorable benefits. The spread was affected by higher interest credited and lower returns related to commercial mortgage loan funds during the first six months of 2024. Benefits and change in reserves reflected a lower favorable market risk benefit adjustment compared to the prior year and higher mortality. While the net spread from our FHLB funding agreements remained stable compared with 2023, higher FHLB borrowing costs and increased advances drove the higher interest credited expense along with a higher interest credited rate on our retained block. 
 For the Retirement business, net annuity contract deposits were up 1.0 for the quarter at 126.8 million, while deposits to the retained 403(b) block remained stable. Educators continue to begin their relationship with Horace Mann through 403(b) retirement savings products, which provide encouraging cross-sell opportunities. Average persistency has declined slightly from the prior year. 
 Horace Mann currently has 5.5 billion in annuity assets under management, including 2.1 billion of fixed annuities, 3.0 billion of variable annuities and 0.4 billion of fixed indexed annuities. Assets under administration, which includes Horace Mann Retirement Advantage and other advisory and recordkeeping assets, continue to benefit from the strong equity markets. 
 Life annualized sales were 2.5 million, up 13.6 for the quarter and persistency remains strong. Life insurance in force rose to 20.9 billion at quarter-end. 
 We actively manage our interest rate risk exposure, considering a variety of factors, including earned interest rates, credited interest rates and the relationship between the expected durations of assets and liabilities. We 
 Horace Mann Educators Corporation 45 
 Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 

estimate that over the next 12 months approximately 520.2 million of the Life Retirement investment portfolio and related investable cash flows will be reinvested at current market rates. 
 As a general guideline, based on our existing policies and investment portfolio, the impact from a 100 basis point decline in the average reinvestment rate would reduce Life Retirement net investment income by approximately 2.0 million in year one and 6.0 million in year two, reducing the annualized net interest spread on fixed annuities by approximately 7 basis points and 21 basis points in the respective periods, compared to the current period annualized net interest spread on fixed annuities. We could also consider potential changes in rates credited to policyholders, tempered by any restrictions on the ability to adjust policyholder rates due to guaranteed minimum crediting rates. 
 
 Supplemental Group Benefits 
 The Supplemental Group Benefits segment markets employer-sponsored group solutions for districts and other public employers, as well as worksite direct products typically distributed through the employer channel. The Worksite business provides group term life, disability and specialty health insurance, along with supplemental products including cancer, heart, hospital, supplemental disability and accident coverages. The Supplemental Group Benefits segment represented 19 of total revenues in 2023. 
 
 (All comparisons vs. same periods in 2023, unless noted otherwise) 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income reflected the following factors: 
 Decline in premium due to run-off of an indemnified block of employer-sponsored products; net premiums earned increased 2.2 excluding the run-off for the nine months 
 Higher benefits ratio for worksite direct products for the nine months reflecting the anticipated increase in utilization 
 Higher benefits ratio for employer sponsored for three months driven by book of business in run-off but comparable benefit ratios for the nine months

 Supplemental Group Benefits segment net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 14.8 million and 39.9 million were down 1.0 million and 1.7 million, respectively. The worksite direct benefits ratio increased for the nine months reflecting the anticipated increase in utilization. The employer-sponsored benefit ratio was 0.8 points higher than the prior year due to the block of business in run-off and is offset in Other income due to the indemnification agreement related to the book in run-off. The non-cash impact of amortization of intangible assets under purchase accounting reduced core earnings by 3.6 million, pretax, in both years. 
 Total sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 19.4 million with worksite direct product sales of 11.5 million and employer-sponsored products of 7.9 million. Worksite direct sales increased 7.5 and employer sponsored sales decreased 21.0 . Employer sponsored sales may vary significantly between comparable periods due to differences in average case size and specific timing of new cases can result in quarter over quarter variances. Persistency remains strong for the segment.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net results improved 7.8 million and 17.4 million, respectively, primarily due to lower net investment losses partially offset by an increase in interest expense. 
 
 Investment Results 
 (All comparisons vs. same periods in 2023, unless noted otherwise) 
 Our investment strategy is primarily focused on generating income to support product liabilities, and balances principal protection and risk. Total net investment income includes net investment income from our managed investment portfolio as well as accreted investment income from the deposit asset on reinsurance related to the company's reinsurance of policy liabilities related to legacy individual annuities written in 2002 or earlier.

 (301.8) (680.0) N.M 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net investment income from our managed investment portfolio decreased 4.6 million and increased 0.8 million, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by lower returns in the limited partnership portfolio. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected stronger income from the fixed income portfolios and the FHLB program, significantly offset by lower returns in the commercial mortgage loan fund portfolio. The nine month investment yield on the portfolio excluding limited partnership interests was 4.5 , with new money yields continuing to exceed portfolio yields in the core fixed maturity securities portfolio.

 Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, pretax net investment losses decreased 12.2 million and 29.8 million, respectively. The decrease was due to a reduction in realized losses on dispositions of invested assets. 
 Pretax net unrealized investment losses on fixed maturity securities as of September 30, 2024 were down 115.8 million, or 27.7 , compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease of 10 basis points in US Treasury rates and investment-grade credit spreads that were tighter by 10 basis points.

 (2) At September 30, 2024, the AA rated fair value amount included 385.69 million of U.S. Government and federally sponsored agency securities and 719.6 million of mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities issued by U.S. Government and federally sponsored agencies. 
 (3) This category primarily represents private placement and municipal securities not rated by a NRSRO. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fixed maturity securities portfolio had 388.8 million of pretax gross unrealized investment losses on 3,286.4 million of fair value related to 2,116 positions. Of the investment positions with gross unrealized losses, there were 320 trading below 80.0 of the carrying value as of September 30, 2024. The Company views the decrease in fair value of all of the fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses as of September 30, 2024 as due to factors other than a credit loss. Future changes in circumstances related to these and other securities could require subsequent recognition of impairment. See Part II - Item 8, Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. 
 Unrealized investment losses declined due to a decrease in US Treasury rates and tighter credit spreads. As of September 30, 2024, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield decreased 10 basis points since December 31, 2023, declining from 3.88 as of December 31, 2023 to 3.78 as of September 30, 2024. Credit spreads were tighter during the same time period, with investment grade and high yield tighter by 10 and 28 basis points, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, investment grade and high yield total returns were up 5.3 and 8.0 , respectively, since December 31, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and access to capital were not materially impacted by inflation or changes in interest rates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For further discussion regarding the potential future impacts of inflation and changes in interest rates, see Part I Item 1A - Risk Factors and Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Effects of Inflation and Changes in Interest Rates presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Investments 
 Information regarding our investment portfolio, which is comprised primarily of investment grade fixed maturity securities, is presented in Part I - Item 1, Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as Part I - Item 2 - Investment Results in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Cash Flow 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements, within a 12 month operating cycle, are for the timely payment of claims and benefits to policyholders, operating expenses, interest payments and federal income taxes. Cash flow generated from operations has been, and is expected to be, adequate to meet our operating cash needs in the next 12 months. Cash flow in excess of operational needs has been used to fund business growth, pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock. Long-term liquidity requirements, beyond one year, are principally for the payment of future insurance and annuity policy claims and benefits, as well as retirement of debt. The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows activity for the periods indicated. 
 in millions) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024-2023 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 258.6 199.2 29.8 Net cash used in investing activities (131.4) (85.6) 53.5 Net cash used in financing activities (117.1) (121.9) -3.9 Net decrease in cash 10.1 (8.3) -221.7 Cash at beginning of period 29.7 42.8 -30.6 Cash at end of period 39.8 34.5 15.4 
 Operating Activities 
 As a holding company, we conduct our principal operations in the personal lines segment of the property and casualty, life, retirement, supplemental and group insurance industries through our subsidiaries. Our insurance subsidiaries generate cash flow from premium and investment income, generally well in excess of their immediate needs for policy obligations, operating expenses and other cash requirements. Fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflect seasonality in timing of premium and investment income collections and claims and benefits payments. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities increased 59.4 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (131.4) million and (85.6) million, respectively. 
 Investing cash inflows consist primarily of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments. Investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments. Our investment strategy is to appropriately match the cash flows and durations of our assets with the cash flows and durations of our liabilities to meet the funding requirements of our business and, generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by our fixed maturity securities portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of our insurance reserves. When market opportunities arise, we may sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the yield and credit quality of our portfolio. We may at times also sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve 
 Horace Mann Educators Corporation 51 
 Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 

the duration matching of our assets and liabilities and/or rebalance our portfolio. As a result, sales before maturity may vary from period to period. The sale and purchase of short-term investments is influenced by proceeds received from FHLB funding advances, issuance of debt, our reverse repurchase agreement program, and by the amount of cash which is at times held in short-term investments to facilitate the availability of cash to fund the purchase of appropriate long-term investments, repay maturing debt, and/or to respond to catastrophes. 
 Financing Activities 
 Financing activities include primarily payment of dividends, receipt and withdrawal of funds by annuity contractholders, changes in the deposit asset on reinsurance, repurchases of our common stock, fluctuations in book overdraft balances, and borrowings, repayments and repurchases related to debt facilities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities increased 4.8 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a 42.9 million decrease in cash outflows from the deposit asset on reinsurance and a 115.0 million increase in net cash inflow from reverse repurchase agreements partially offset by a 57.0 million net reduction in net cash inflows (advances less repayments) from FHLB funding agreements and a 48.7 million net reduction in cash inflows related to issuing Senior Notes of 297.7 million and repaying outstanding borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility of 249.0 million in 2023.

Liquidity Sources and Uses 
 Our potential sources and uses of funds principally include the following activities: 
 Property Casualty Life Retirement Supplemental Group Benefits Corporate Other Activities for potential sources of funds Receipt of insurance premiums, contractholder charges and fees Recurring service fees, commissions and overrides Contractholder fund deposits Reinsurance and indemnification program recoveries Receipts of principal, interest and dividends on investments Proceeds from sales of investments Proceeds from FHLB borrowing and funding agreements Proceeds from reverse repurchase agreements Intercompany loans Capital contributions from parent Dividends or return of capital from subsidiaries Tax refunds/settlements Proceeds from periodic issuance of additional securities Proceeds from debt issuances Proceeds from revolving credit facility Receipt of intercompany settlements related to employee benefit plans Activities for potential uses of funds Payment of claims and related expenses Payment of contract benefits, surrenders and withdrawals Reinsurance cessions and indemnification program payments Payment of operating costs and expenses Payments to purchase investments Repayment of FHLB borrowing and funding agreements Repayment of reverse repurchase agreements Payment or repayment of intercompany loans Capital contributions to subsidiaries Dividends or return of capital to shareholders/parent company Tax payments/settlements Common share repurchases Debt service expenses and repayments Repayment on revolving credit facility Payments related to employee benefit plans Payments for business acquisitions 
 We actively manage our financial position and liquidity levels in light of changing market, economic and business conditions. Liquidity is managed at both the entity and enterprise level across HMEC and is assessed on both base and stressed level liquidity needs. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet these needs. Additionally, we have existing intercompany agreements in place that facilitate liquidity management across HMEC to enhance flexibility. 
 Horace Mann Educators Corporation 53 
 Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 

As of September 30, 2024, we held 1.1 billion of cash, U.S. government and agency fixed maturity securities and public equity securities (excluding non-redeemable preferred stocks and foreign equity securities) which, under normal market conditions, could be rapidly liquidated. 
 Certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. Those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade of our Senior Notes rating to non-investment grade status or a downgrade in our insurance subsidiaries' financial strength ratings. The rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities; therefore, a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities. 
 Capital Resources 
 We have determined the amount of capital that is needed to adequately fund and support business growth, primarily based on risk-based capital formulas, including those developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Historically, our insurance subsidiaries have generated capital in excess of such needed levels. These excess amounts have been paid to us through dividends. We have then utilized these dividends and our access to the capital markets to fund growth initiatives, service and retire debt, pay dividends to our shareholders, repurchase shares of our common stock and for other corporate purposes. If necessary, we also have other potential sources of liquidity that could provide for additional funding to meet corporate obligations or pay shareholder dividends, including a revolving line of credit, reverse repurchase agreements program, as well as issuances of various securities. 
 The insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the amount of annual dividends or other distributions, including loans or cash advances, available to us without prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities. The aggregate amount of dividends that may be paid in 2024 from all of our insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval is 112.3 million, excluding the impact and timing of prior dividends, of which 73.0 million was paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We anticipate that our sources of capital will continue to generate sufficient capital to meet the needs for business growth, debt interest payments, shareholder dividends and our share repurchase programs. Additional information is contained in Part II - Item 8, Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Total capital was 1,833.7 million as of September 30, 2024, including 546.7 million of long-term debt. Total debt represented 29.8 of total capital including net unrealized investment losses on fixed maturity securities (26.7 excluding net unrealized investment losses on fixed maturity securities and net reserve remeasurements attributable to discount rates as of September 30, 2024, which was slightly above our long-term target of 25.0 for our debt to capital ratio excluding net unrealized investment gains (losses) and net reserve remeasurements attributable to discount rate. 
 Shareholders' equity was 1,287.0 million as of September 30, 2024, including net unrealized investment losses on fixed maturity securities of 237.2 million after taxes. The market value of our common stock and the market value per share were 1,423.4 million and 34.95, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. Book value per share and adjusted book value per share was 31.60 and 36.89, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. 
 Additional information regarding net unrealized investment gains (losses) on fixed maturity securities as of September 30, 2024 is included in Part I - Item 1, Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as in Part I - Item 2 - Investment Results in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Total dividends paid to shareholders was 41.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In March, May and September of 2024, the Board of Directors (Board) approved regular quarterly dividends of 0.34 per share. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 256,159 shares of our common stock at an average price per share of 33.33 under our share repurchase program. See Part II - Item 8, Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information. As of September 30, 2024, 26.3 million remained authorized for future share repurchases under the share repurchase program.

 (1) We designate debt obligations as "long-term" based on maturity date at issuance. 
 
 On September 15, 2023, we issued 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.25 senior notes (2023 Senior Notes), which will mature on September 15, 2028, issued at a discount resulting in an effective yield of 7.29 . Interest on the 2023 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually at a rate of 7.25 . The 2023 Senior Notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at any time, at our option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100 of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted, on a semi-annual basis, at the Treasury yield (as defined in the indenture) plus 45 basis points, plus, in either of the above cases, accrued interest to the date of redemption. The 2023 Senior Notes are traded in the open market (HMN 7.25). 
 The net proceeds from the sale of the 2023 Senior Notes were used to fully repay the 249.0 million balance on the Revolving Credit Facility with remaining net proceeds from the sale to be used for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we had 325.0 million available on the Revolving Credit Facility, with an interest rate based on SOFR plus 115 basis points plus the applicable benchmark adjustment spread. The Revolving Credit Facility expires on July 12, 2026. The unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a variable commitment fee, which was 0.15 on an annual basis as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50 senior notes (2015 Senior Notes), which will mature on December 1, 2025, issued at a discount resulting in an effective yield of 4.53 . Interest on the 2015 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually at a rate of 4.50 . Detailed information regarding the redemption terms of the 2015 Senior Notes is contained in the Part II - Item 8, Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The 2015 Senior Notes are traded in the open market (HMN 4.50). 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding with FHLB. The Board has authorized a maximum amount equal to 15 of net aggregate admitted assets less separate account assets of the insurance subsidiaries for FHLB borrowing and funding agreements which is below our maximum FHLB borrowing capacity. 
 We had an obligation for securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements of 45.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to no reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2023. 
 To provide additional capital management flexibility, we filed a "universal shelf" registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 8, 2024. The registration statement, which registered the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of various securities, which may include debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, delayed delivery contracts and/or units that include any of these securities, was automatically effective on March 8, 2024. Unless withdrawn by us earlier, this registration statement will remain effective through March 8, 2027. No securities associated with the registration statement have been issued at the time of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 On March 13, 2018, we filed a "shelf" registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC which became effective on May 2, 2018. Under this registration statement, we may from time to time offer and issue up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions of other businesses, assets or securities.

 Financial Ratings 
 Our principal insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (A.M. Best), Fitch, Moody's, and S P. These rating agencies have also assigned ratings to our Senior Notes. The ratings that are assigned by these agencies, which are subject to change, can impact, among other things, our access to sources of capital, cost of capital, and competitive position. These ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of our securities. 
 All four agencies currently have assigned the same insurance financial strength ratings to our Property Casualty and Life insurance subsidiaries. Only A.M. Best currently rates our Supplemental Group Benefits subsidiaries, each of which is rated at the same level as our Property Casualty and Life Retirement subsidiaries. Assigned ratings and respective affirmation/review dates as of October 31, 2024 were as follows:

 Reinsurance Programs 
 There have been no material changes in our reinsurance programs for our Property Casualty, Life Retirement and Supplemental Group Benefits segments from that disclosed in Part I - Item 1, Reporting Segments in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 3. I Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market value risk, our primary market risk exposure, is the risk that our invested assets will decrease in value. This decrease in value may be due to (1) a change in the yields realized on our assets and prevailing market yields for similar assets, (2) an unfavorable change in the liquidity of an investment, (3) an unfavorable change in the financial prospects of the issuer of an investment, or (4) a downgrade in the credit rating of the issuer of an investment. Also see Consolidated Results of Operations in Part I - Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding net investment losses. 
 Significant changes in interest rates expose us to the risk of experiencing losses or earning a reduced level of income based on the difference between the interest rates earned on our investments and the credited interest rates on our insurance and investment contract liabilities. Also see Consolidated Results of Operations in Part I - Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding interest credited to policyholders. 
 Horace Mann Educators Corporation 56 
 Third Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q 

We seek to manage our market value risk by coordinating the projected cash inflows of assets with the projected cash outflows of liabilities. For all of our assets and liabilities, we seek to maintain reasonable durations, consistent with the maximization of income without sacrificing investment quality, while providing for liquidity and diversification. The investment risk associated with variable annuity deposits and the underlying mutual funds is assumed by those contractholders, and not by us. Certain fees that we earn from variable annuity deposits are based on the market value of the funds deposited. 
 More detailed descriptions of our exposure to market value risks and the management of those risks is contained in Part II - Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 4. I Controls and Procedures 
 Management's Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us (including our consolidated subsidiaries) that is required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. No material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures were identified in the evaluation and therefore, no corrective actions were taken. There were no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During third-quarter 2024, the Company implemented a new financial system including the general ledger and financial reporting tools to provide advanced data analytic capabilities and improve efficiency of the financial reporting process. This initiative was not undertaken in response to any actual or perceived deficiencies or to remedy any gaps or weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Concurrent with the implementation, changes were made to the relevant business processes and the related control activities over the implementation in order to maintain appropriate controls over financial reporting. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Exhibit 99.1 

 Glossary of Selected Terms 
 
 The following measures are used by the Company s management to evaluate performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. A number of these measures are components of net income or the balance sheet but, in some cases, are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (non-GAAP) under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) or Consolidated Balance Sheets or are not required to be disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements or, in some cases, there is inclusion or exclusion of certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). 
 In the opinion of the Company s management, a discussion of these measures provides investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and other financial statement users with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company s periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company's financial performance. Internally, the Company's management uses the measures to evaluate performance against historical results, to establish financial targets on a consolidated basis and for other reasons. 
 Some of these measures exclude net investment gains (losses), net unrealized investment gains (losses) on fixed maturity securities and net reserve remeasurements attributable to discount rates which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Also, some of these measures exclude goodwill and intangible asset impairments and intangible asset amortization. 
 Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by the Company s management. 
 Adjusted book value per share - The result of dividing (1) total shareholders equity excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains (losses) on fixed maturity securities and after-tax net reserve remeasurements attributable to discount rates by (2) ending shares outstanding. Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes it is useful to consider the trend in book value per share excluding net unrealized investment gains (losses) on fixed maturity securities and net reserve remeasurements attributable to discount rates in conjunction with book value per share to identify and analyze the change in net worth. Management also believes the non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and are generally driven by economic developments, primarily financial market conditions, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by the Company s underlying insurance operations. 
 Tangible book value per share - The result of dividing (1) total shareholders equity excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains (losses) on fixed maturity securities after-tax net reserve remeasurements attributable to discount rates, goodwill and other intangible assets (including the related impact of deferred taxes) by (2) ending shares outstanding. Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 Debt to total capitalization ratio, excluding net unrealized investment gains (losses) on fixed maturity securities and net reserve remeasurements attributable to discount rates - The result of dividing (1) total debt by (2) total debt plus common shareholders' equity excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains (losses) on fixed maturity securities and after-tax net reserve remeasurements attributable to discount rates from common shareholders' equity. The debt to total capitalization ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 Catastrophe costs - The sum of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and before income tax benefits that includes allocated loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance reinstatement premiums, excluding unallocated loss adjustment expenses. 
 Catastrophe losses - In categorizing property and casualty claims as being from a catastrophe, the Company utilizes the designations of the Property Claim Services, a subsidiary of Insurance Services Office, Inc., and additionally beginning in 2007, includes losses from all such events that meet the definition of a covered loss in the Company s primary catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contract, and reports claims and claim expense amounts net of reinsurance recoverables. A catastrophe is a severe loss resulting from natural and man-made events within a particular territory, including risks such as hurricane, fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events, that causes 25 million or more in insured property and casualty losses for the industry and affects a significant number of property and casualty insurers and policyholders. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics. Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount of loss in advance. Their 
 1 

effects are not included in earnings or claim and claim expense reserves prior to occurrence. In the opinion of the Company s management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings. 
 Core earnings (loss) - Consolidated net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net investment gains (losses), discontinued operations, the after-tax impact of goodwill and intangible asset impairments and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles when applicable. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 Pretax core earnings (loss) - Pretax net income (loss) excluding the pretax impact of net investment gains (losses), discontinued operations, the pretax impact of goodwill and intangible asset impairments and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles when applicable. Income before income taxes is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 Segment core earnings (loss) - Determined in the same manner as core earnings (loss) on a consolidated basis. Management uses segment core earnings to analyze each segment's performance and as a tool in making business decisions. Financial statement users also consider core earnings when analyzing the results and trends of insurance companies. 
 Core earnings (loss) per share - Core earnings on a per common share basis. Earnings per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 Adjusted core earnings (loss) Determined in the same manner as core earnings (loss) but this measure is further adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization and the change in market risk benefits to calculate adjusted core earnings (loss). Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 Pretax adjusted core earnings (loss) Determined in the same manner as pretax core earnings (loss) but this measure is further adjusted to exclude pretax intangible asset amortization and the pretax change in market risk benefits to calculate pretax adjusted core earnings (loss). Income before income taxes is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
