 Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 The Company may periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on variable interest rate debt and their impact on earnings and cash flows. Under the swap agreements, the Company receives floating interest rate payments and makes interest payments based on fixed interest rates. Under the cap contracts, the Company receives floating interest rate payments and makes interest payments based on capped interest rates. The Company designates its interest rate swap and interest rate cap instruments as cash flow hedges at inception. 
 The Company uses cross-currency swap agreements to manage foreign currency exchange risk by converting fixed-rate Euro-denominated borrowings and fixed-rate GBP-denominated borrowings including periodic interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to fixed-rate USD debt. The cross-currency swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges.

In connection with the early redemption of the 2025 Notes, the Company settled the corresponding 2020 Euro Swaps on the same date for approximately million. As a result of the early settlement, the Company reclassed the remaining OCI balance associated with the 2020 Euro Swaps of approximately million into interest expense during the fourth quarter of 2024. Other than stated above, the settlement payment of the 2020 Euro Swaps will not result in any income statement recognition during the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Additional restrictions and covenants which limit, among other things, the payment of dividends and the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens; and 
 Standard events of default which, upon occurrence, may permit the lenders to terminate the Global Senior Facility and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. 
 On October 17, 2024, the Company agreed to amend and restate the Global Senior Facility to, among other things, (1) upsize the facility by million from million to million, (2) extend the termination date of the facility from September 2027 to September 2028 except for a million tranche that will continue to terminate in September 2027, and (3) decrease the interest margin by from to . 
 The Global Senior Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the guarantors. Pursuant to the terms of an intercreditor agreement entered into with respect to the relative positions of (1) the Global Senior Facility and any super priority hedging liabilities (collectively, Super Senior Liabilities and (2) the Senior Secured Notes, Super Senior Liabilities that are secured by assets that also secure the Senior Secured Notes will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets.

Subject to the intercreditor agreement described above under the section Global Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, Super Senior Liabilities that are secured by assets that also secure the Senior Secured Notes will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets.

 In order to reduce the risk related to the potential dilution and/or the potential cash payments the Company may be required to make in the event that the market price of the Company s common stock becomes greater than the conversion prices of the Convertible Notes, the Company may enter into hedge programs that increase the effective conversion price for the Convertible Notes. In connection with the issuance of the 2029 Convertible Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions that effectively raised the conversion price of the 2029 Convertible Notes from to . These hedging instruments have been determined to be indexed to the Company s own stock and meet the criteria for equity classification.

 Purchase Commitments 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into forward flow purchase agreements. A forward flow purchase agreement is a commitment to purchase receivables over a duration that is typically three to twelve months, but can be longer, generally with a specifically defined volume range, frequency, and pricing. Typically, these forward flow contracts have provisions that allow for early termination or price re-negotiation should the underlying quality of the portfolio deteriorate over time or if any particular month s delivery is materially different than the original portfolio used to price the forward flow contract. Certain of these forward flow purchase agreements may also have termination clauses, whereby the agreements can be canceled by either party upon providing a certain specified amount of notice. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had entered into forward flow purchase agreements for the purchase of nonperforming loans with an estimated minimum aggregate purchase price of approximately million. The Company

Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements relating to Encore Capital Group, Inc. Encore and its subsidiaries (which we may collectively refer to as the Company, we, our or us within the meaning of the securities laws. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, project, intend, plan, will, may, and similar expressions often characterize forward-looking statements.

 Our Business 
 We are an international specialty finance company providing debt recovery solutions and other related services for consumers across a broad range of financial assets. We purchase portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables at deep discounts to face value and manage them by working with individuals as they repay their obligations and work toward financial recovery. Defaulted receivables are consumers unpaid financial commitments to credit originators, including banks, credit unions, consumer finance companies and commercial retailers. Defaulted receivables may also include receivables subject to bankruptcy proceedings. We also provide debt servicing and other portfolio management services to credit originators for non-performing loans in Europe. 
 Encore Capital Group, Inc. Encore has three business units: MCM, which consists of Midland Credit Management, Inc. and its subsidiaries and domestic affiliates; Cabot, which consists of Cabot Credit Management Limited CCM and its subsidiaries and European affiliates, and LAAP, which is comprised of our investments and operations in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. 
 MCM (United States) 
 Through MCM, we are a market leader in portfolio purchasing and recovery in the United States. 
 Cabot (Europe) 
 Through Cabot, we are one of the largest credit management services providers in Europe and the United Kingdom. Cabot, in addition to its primary business of portfolio purchasing and recovery, also provides a range of debt servicing offerings such as early stage collections, business process outsourcing BPO ), and contingent collections, including through Wescot Credit Services Limited Wescot ), a leading UK contingency debt collection and BPO services company. 
 LAAP (Latin America and Asia-Pacific) 
 We have purchased non-performing loans in Mexico. Additionally, we have invested in Encore Asset Reconstruction Company EARC in India. 
 To date, operating results from LAAP have not been significant to our total consolidated operating results. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on continuing to invest in our core portfolio purchasing and recovery business in the United States and United Kingdom and strengthening and developing our business in the rest of Europe.

Table of Contents 

 Government Regulation 
 MCM (United States) 
 As discussed in more detail under Part I - Item 1 - Business - Government Regulation contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our operations in the United States are subject to federal, state and municipal statutes, rules, regulations and ordinances that establish specific guidelines and procedures that debt purchasers and collectors must follow when collecting consumer accounts, including among others, specific guidelines and procedures for communicating with consumers and prohibitions on unfair, deceptive or abusive debt collection practices. 
 Cabot (Europe) 
 As discussed in more detail under Part I - Item 1 - Business - Government Regulation contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our operations in Europe are affected by foreign statutes, rules and regulations regarding debt collection and debt purchase activities. These statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances, guidelines and procedures are modified from time to time by the relevant authorities charged with their administration, which could affect the way we conduct our business. 
 
 Portfolio Purchasing and Recovery 
 MCM (United States) 
 In the United States, the defaulted consumer receivable portfolios we purchase are primarily charged-off credit card debt portfolios. A small percentage of our capital deployment in the United States is comprised of receivable portfolios subject to Chapter 13 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings. 
 We purchase receivables based on robust, account-level valuation methods and employ proprietary statistical and behavioral models across our U.S. operations. These methods and models generally allow us to value portfolios accurately (limiting the risk of overpaying), avoid buying portfolios that are incompatible with our methods or strategies and align the accounts we purchase with our business channels to maximize future collections. As a result, we have been able to realize significant returns from the receivables we acquire. We maintain strong relationships with many of the largest financial service providers in the United States. 
 Cabot (Europe) 
 In Europe, our purchased defaulted debt portfolios primarily consist of paying and non-paying consumer loan accounts. We purchase paying and non-paying receivable portfolios using a proprietary pricing model that utilizes account-level statistical and behavioral data. This model generally allows us to value portfolios accurately and quantify portfolio performance in order to maximize future collections. As a result, we have been able to realize significant returns from the assets we have acquired. We maintain strong relationships with many of the largest financial services providers in the United Kingdom and Europe. 
 
 Purchases and Collections 
 Portfolio Pricing, Supply and Demand 
 MCM (United States) 
 With lending reaching record levels and the highest U.S. charge-off rate in ten years, supply remains elevated at a record level. Issuers have continued to sell predominantly fresh portfolios. Fresh portfolios are portfolios that are generally sold within six months of the consumer s account being charged-off by the financial institution. Pricing in the third quarter remained at favorable levels as a result of elevated market supply. Issuers continue to sell their volume in mostly forward flow arrangements that are often committed early in the calendar year. We believe growth in lending and rising delinquency rates will drive continued growth in supply. 
 We believe that smaller competitors continue to face difficulties in the portfolio purchasing market because of the high cost to operate due to regulatory pressure and increasing cost of capital. We believe this favors larger participants, like MCM, because the larger market participants are better able to adapt to these pressures and commit to larger forward flow agreements and fluctuating volumes. 
 Cabot (Europe) 
 The UK market for charged-off portfolios generally provides a relatively consistent pipeline of opportunities, despite a historically low level of charge-off rates, as creditors have embedded debt sales as an integral part of their business models. The percentage of volume that is sold in multi-year forward flow arrangements has been consistent.

Table of Contents 

 The debt markets in France and Spain continue to be two of the largest in Europe with significant debt. Financial institutions continue to look to dispose of non-performing loans in these markets. 
 While we have seen a resumption of sales activity across all of our European markets, underlying default rates are generally low by historic levels, and sales levels are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. In general, portfolio pricing remains competitive across our European footprint. 
 Purchases by Geographic Location 
 The following table summarizes purchases of receivable portfolios by geographic location during the periods presented (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 MCM (United States) 230,182 179,250 703,517 606,076 Cabot (Europe) 52,303 51,309 153,374 175,239 Total purchases of receivable portfolios 282,485 230,559 856,891 781,315 
 In the United States, capital deployment increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The majority of our deployments in the U.S. come from forward flow agreements, and the timing, contract duration, and volumes for each contract can fluctuate leading to variation when comparing to prior periods. Portfolio purchases in the U.S. were robust as supply increased and pricing improved. 
 In Europe, capital deployment remained relatively consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. Capital deployment decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by continued competitive pricing environment in Europe. The decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign currency translation driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British Pound. 
 Collections from Purchased Receivables by Channel and Geographic Location 
 We utilize three channels for the collection of our purchased receivables: call center and digital collections; legal collections; and collection agencies. The call center and digital collections channel consists of collections that result from our call centers, direct mail program and online collections. The legal collections channel consists of collections that result from our internal legal channel or from our network of retained law firms. The collection agencies channel consists of collections from third-party collections agencies to whom we pay a fee or commission. We utilize this channel to supplement capacity in our internal call centers, to service accounts in regions where we do not have collections operations or for accounts purchased where we maintain the collection agency servicing relationship. The following table summarizes the total collections by collection channel and geographic area during the periods presented (in thousands) :

 Gross collections from purchased receivables increased by 84.9 million, or 18.3 , to 550.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 465.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross collections from purchased receivables increased by 203.7 million, or 14.5 , to 1,607.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,404.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in collections in the United States were primarily a result of consistent increases in capital deployments in the United States in recent quarters. The increases in collections from purchased receivables in Europe were primarily due to the acquisition of portfolios with higher returns in recent periods. Additionally, collections in Europe were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately 3.2 million and 7.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British Pound.

 Comparison of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues primarily include debt purchasing revenue, which is revenue recognized from engaging in debt purchasing and recovery activities. We apply our charge-off policy and fully write-off the amortized costs (i.e., face value net of noncredit discount) of the individual receivables we acquire immediately after purchasing the portfolio. We then record a negative allowance that represents the present value of all expected future recoveries for pools of receivables that share similar risk characteristics using a discounted cash flow approach, which is presented as Investment in receivable portfolios, net in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. The discount rate is an effective interest rate (or purchase EIR established based on the purchase price of the portfolio and the expected future cash flows at the time of purchase. 
 Debt purchasing revenue includes two components: 
 (1) Revenue from receivable portfolios, which is the accretion of the discount on the negative allowance due to the passage of time (generally the portfolio balance multiplied by the EIR), and also includes all revenue from zero basis portfolio ZBA collections, and 
 (2) Changes in recoveries, which includes 
 (a) Recoveries above or below forecast, which is the difference between (i) actual cash collected/recovered during the current period and (ii) expected cash recoveries for the current period, which generally represents over or under performance for the period; and 
 (b) Changes in expected future recoveries, which is the present value change of expected future recoveries, where such change generally results from (i) collections pulled forward from or pushed out to future periods (i.e. amounts either collected early or expected to be collected later) and (ii) magnitude and timing changes to estimates of expected future collections (which can be increases or decreases). 
 30 

Certain pools already fully recovered their cost basis and became zero basis portfolios ZBA prior to our adoption of the accounting standard for Financial Instruments - Credit Losses CECL in January 2020. We did not establish a negative allowance for these pools as we elected the Transition Resource Group for Credit Losses practical expedient to retain the integrity of these legacy pools. Similar to how we treated ZBA collections prior to the adoption of CECL, all subsequent collections to the ZBA pools are recognized as ZBA revenue, which is included in revenue from receivable portfolios in our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 Servicing revenue consists primarily of fee-based income earned on accounts collected on behalf of others, primarily credit originators. We earn fee-based income by providing debt servicing (such as early stage collections, BPO, contingent collections, trace services and litigation activities) to credit originators for non-performing loans in Europe. 
 Other revenues primarily include revenues recognized from the sale of real estate assets that are acquired as a result of our investments in non-performing secured residential mortgage portfolios as well as direct acquisition of real estate assets in Europe and LAAP.

Our operating results are impacted by foreign currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies has an unfavorable impact on our international revenues, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies has a favorable impact on our international revenues. Our revenues were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately 2.5 million and 6.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British Pound by approximately 2.7 and 2.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The increases in revenue recognized from portfolio basis during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to a higher portfolio basis (i.e. a higher investment in receivable balance) in the U.S. driven by a consistent higher volume of purchases in the past several quarters. 
 As discussed above, ZBA revenue represents collections from our legacy ZBA pools. We expect our ZBA revenue to continue to decline as we collect on these legacy pools. We do not expect to have new ZBA pools in the future. 
 Recoveries above or below forecast represent over and under-performance in the reporting period, respectively. Collections during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, over-performed the forecasted collections by approximately 23.0 million and 51.3 million, respectively. Collections during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, under-performed the forecasted collections by approximately 4.3 million and 20.1 million, respectively. 
 When reassessing the forecasts of expected lifetime recoveries during the three months ended September 30, 2024, management considered, among other factors, historical and current collection performance, changes in consumer behavior, and the macroeconomic environment. Most of the current period collections over-performance was from recent vintages acquired in 2023 and 2024 and did not trigger any significant forecasting adjustments to the estimated remaining collections. Therefore, no significant changes in future expected recoveries were recognized as a result of our recurring forecasting process. We recognized approximately 7.8 million of negative changes in expected future recoveries during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from the sale of certain portfolios associated with the exit of our secured non-performing mortgage loan business in Spain in September 2024. As a result of the above, we recorded net negative changes in expected future recoveries of approximately 10.3 million, and 45.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded approximately 12.8 million and 9.9 million in net negative changes in expected future recoveries, respectively.

 Servicing revenues increased by approximately 2.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased demand from BPO clients. Service revenues remained relatively consistent during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other revenues remained relatively consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other revenues increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by increase of gains recognized on the sale of real estate assets.

 Our operating results are impacted by foreign currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies has a favorable impact on our international operating expenses, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies has an unfavorable impact on our international operating expenses. Our operating results were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately 1.8 million and 4.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British Pound by approximately 2.7 and 2.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Operating expenses are explained in more detail as follows: 
 Salaries and Employee Benefits 
 The increase in salaries and employee benefits during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the following reasons: 
 An increase in salaries and bonus of approximately 8.9 million primarily due to an increase in overall headcount; and 
 An increase in employee benefits and payroll taxes of approximately 2.8 million. 
 The increase in salaries and employee benefits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the following reasons: 
 An increase in salaries and bonus of approximately 16.6 million primarily due to an increase in overall headcount; and 
 An increase in employee benefits and payroll taxes of approximately 6.2 million.

 Cost of Legal Collections 
 Cost of legal collections primarily includes contingent fees paid to our external network of attorneys and the cost of litigation. We pursue legal collections using a network of attorneys that specialize in collection matters and through our internal legal channel. Under the agreements with our contracted attorneys, we advance certain out-of-pocket court costs. Cost of legal collections does not include internal legal channel employee costs, which are included in salaries and employee benefits in our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 The following tables summarize our cost of legal collections during the periods presented in thousands, except percentages ): Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Court costs 44,282 34,720 9,562 27.5 Legal collection fees 23,057 21,554 1,503 7.0 Total cost of legal collections 67,339 56,274 11,065 19.7

 The increases of cost of legal collections during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to increased legal placements in this channel in the U.S. The increase in cost of legal collections during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was partially offset by decreased contingent fees paid to our external network of attorneys as we grow our legal collection activities through our internal legal channel. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the following reasons: 
 Approximately 2.9 million of increased general and administrative expense include costs associated with our information technology. 
 The increase in general and administrative expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the following reasons: 
 An increase in information technology expenses of approximately 6.0 million; and 
 The increase was partially offset by a decrease in consulting fees of approximately 1.5 million and a decrease in facilities fees of approximately 1.4 million. 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 The increase in other operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in postage and printing expenses and an increase in collections bank charges and trace agencies fees of approximately 3.1 million and 0.9 million, respectively. The increase in other operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in postage and printing expenses and an increase in collections bank charges and trace agencies fees of approximately 8.0 million and 2.4 million, respectively.

 Collection Agency Commissions 
 Collection agency commissions are commissions paid to third-party collection agencies. Collections through the collections agencies channel are predominately in Europe and vary from period to period depending on, among other things, the number of accounts placed with an agency versus accounts collected internally. Commission rates vary depending on, among other things, the amount of time that has passed since the charge-off of the accounts placed with an agency, the asset class, and the geographic location of the receivables. Generally, freshly charged-off accounts have a lower commission rate than accounts that have been charged off for a longer period of time, and commission rates for purchased bankruptcy portfolios are lower than the commission rates for charged-off credit card accounts. Collection agency commissions decreased by approximately 0.7 million and 4.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decreases were primarily due to fewer accounts placed with external agencies and favorable commission rates received from such agencies in Europe. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 T he decrease in depr eciation and amortization expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to smaller depreciable and amortizable asset balances during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation expenses and amortization expenses decreased by approximately 1.8 million and 1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and by approximately 5.8 million and 3.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 The increase in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the following reasons: 
 The effect resulting from increased average debt balance of approximately 6.0 million; and 
 The effect resulting from rising interest rates of approximately 9.1 million; and 
 An unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 0.6 million driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British Pound. 
 The increase in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the following reasons: 
 The effect resulting from increased average debt balance of approximately 17.7 million; 
 The effect resulting from rising interest rates of approximately 17.9 million; and 
 An unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 1.2 million driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British Pound.

 Other Income, net of Other Expense 
 Other income or expense consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains or losses, interest income, and gains or losses recognized on certain transactions outside of our normal course of business. Other income, net, was 1.6 million and 6.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Other income, net, was 5.1 million and 5.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are as follows for the periods presented in thousands ): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Provision for income taxes 10,119 10,724 27,701 27,162 Effective tax rate 24.8 35.7 24.3 29.7 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the differences between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate were primarily due to state income taxes. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate was primarily due to the recording of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate was primarily due to state income taxes, an accrual related to state tax filing positions, and other foreign adjustments. 
 
 Non-GAAP Disclosure 
 In addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ), we provide historical non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that the presentation of such non-GAAP financial information is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our operations. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. 
 Management believes that the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and facilitates comparison of operating results across a broad spectrum of companies with varying capital structures, compensation strategies, derivative instruments, and amortization methods, which provide a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position, and prospects for the future. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of, our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. 
 Adjusted EBITDA. Management utilizes adjusted EBITDA (defined as net income before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition, integration and restructuring related expenses, and other charges or gains that are not indicative of ongoing operations), in the evaluation of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented is as follows (in thousands):

Supplemental Performance Data 
 The tables included in this supplemental performance data section include detail for purchases, collections and ERC by year of purchase. 
 Our collection expectations are based on account characteristics and economic variables. Additional adjustments are made to account for qualitative factors that may affect the payment behavior of our consumers and servicing related adjustments to ensure our collection expectations are aligned with our operations. We continue to refine our process of forecasting collections both domestically and internationally with a focus on operational enhancements. Our collection expectations vary between types of portfolio and geographic location. As a result, past performance of pools in certain geographic locations or of certain types of portfolio are not necessarily a suitable indicator of future results in other locations or for other types of portfolio. 
 The supplemental performance data presented in this section is impacted by foreign currency translation, which represents the effect of translating financial results where the functional currency of our foreign subsidiary is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. For example, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies has an unfavorable reporting impact on our international purchases, collections, and ERC, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies has a favorable impact on our international purchases, collections, and ERC. 
 We utilize proprietary forecasting models to continuously evaluate the economic life of each pool.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods presented (in thousands) : Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Unaudited) Net cash provided by operating activities 132,624 116,211 Net cash used in investing activities (175,705) (270,726) Net cash provided by financing activities 130,487 158,872 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash provided by operating activities was 132.6 million and 116.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating cash flows are derived by adjusting net income for non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, changes in recoveries, stock-based compensation charges, and changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations. Adjusting for the changes in recoveries resulted in a decrease in operating cash flows by 6.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in operating cash flows by 30.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to Note 5: Investment in Receivable Portfolios, Net in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for discussion relating to changes in recoveries. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 175.7 million and 270.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash provided by or used in investing activities is primarily affected by receivable portfolio purchases offset by collection proceeds applied to the principal of our receivable portfolios. Receivable portfolio purchases, net of put-backs, were 844.9 million and 772.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Collection proceeds applied to the investment in receivable portfolios, were 642.0 million and 504.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Refer to Purchases and Collections within Item 2: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion relating to purchases and collections. 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 130.5 million and 158.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Financing cash flows are generally affected by borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from various debt offerings, offset by repayments of amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and repayments of various notes. Borrowings under our credit facilities were 458.8 million and 630.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Repayments of amounts outstanding under our credit facilities were 1,292.6 million and 446.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 1.0 billion in senior secured notes (of which 500.0 million matures in 2029 and 500.0 million matures in 2030). We used a portion of the proceeds from the senior secured notes issuance to repay drawings under our Global Senior Facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued 230.0 million 4.00 convertible senior notes that mature in 2029, and used 212.5 million in cash to repurchase and settle our exchangeable senior notes due 2023. 
 Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of capital are cash collections from our investment in receivable portfolios, bank borrowings, debt offerings, and equity offerings. Depending on the capital markets, we consider additional financings to fund our operations and any potential acquisitions. From time to time, we may repurchase outstanding debt or equity and/or restructure or refinance debt obligations. Our primary cash requirements include funding the purchase of receivable portfolios, operating expenses, the payment of interest and principal on borrowings, the payment of income taxes, funding any entity acquisitions and share repurchases. 
 We are in material compliance with all covenants under our financing arrangements. See Note 7: Borrowings in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our debt. Available capacity under our Global Senior Facility, was 1,196.0 million as of September 30, 2024. In October 2024, the Company redeemed the 2025 Notes at par, which was funded in part by a utilization of the Global Senior Facility of approximately 314.3 million. The Global Senior Facility was subsequently upsized by 92.0 million from 1,203.0 million to 1,295.0 million in October 2024. 
 In March 2024, we issued 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.250 Senior Secured Notes due 2029 at an issue price of 100.000 through a private placement offering. Additionally, in May 2024, we issued 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.500 Senior Secured Notes due 2030 at an issue price of 100.000 through a separate private placement offering. 
 Our Board of Directors has approved a 300.0 million share repurchase program. Repurchases under this program are expected to be made from cash on hand and/or a drawing from our Global Senior Facility and may be made from time to time, subject to market conditions and other factors, in the open market, through private transactions, block transactions, or other methods as determined by our management and Board of Directors, and in accordance with market conditions, other corporate considerations, and applicable regulatory requirements. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified or suspended at our discretion. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not make any repurchases under the share repurchase program. Our practice is to retire the 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 shares repurchased. As of September 30, 2024, authorization for 91.9 million of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, consisted of 40.9 million held by U.S.-based entities and 206.5 million held by foreign entities. Most of our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign entities is indefinitely reinvested and may be subject to material tax effects if repatriated. However, we believe that our sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the United States and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds. 
 Included in cash and cash equivalents is cash that was collected on behalf of, and remains payable to, third-party clients. The balance of cash held for clients was 23.4 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, timing of cash collections from our consumers, and other risks detailed in our Risk Factors. However, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, given our expectation of continued positive cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalents, our access to capital markets, and availability under our credit facilities. Our future cash needs will depend on our acquisitions of portfolios and businesses. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates. Other than the ongoing reassessment of expected future recoveries of our investment in receivable portfolios during each reporting period under our CECL accounting policy as discussed in Note 5: Investment in Receivable Portfolios, Net to our condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
