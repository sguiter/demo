 Amrock closing fees The Company recognizes closing fees for non-recurring services provided in connection with the origination of the loan. These fees are recognized at the time of loan closing for purchase transactions or at the end of a client's three-day rescission period for refinance transactions, which represents the point in time the loan closing services performance obligation is satisfied. The consideration received for closing services is a fixed fee per loan that varies by state and loan type.

Real estate network referral fees were and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 reportable segments - Direct to Consumer and Partner Network. The key factors used to identify these reportable segments are the Company s internal operations and the nature of its marketing channels, which drive client acquisition into the mortgage platform. This determination reflects how the CODM monitors performance, allocates capital and makes strategic and operational decisions. 
 
 Direct to Consumer 
 
 In the Direct to Consumer segment, clients have the ability to interact with Rocket Mortgage online and/or with the Company s mortgage bankers. The Company markets to potential clients in this segment through various brand campaigns and performance marketing channels. The Direct to Consumer segment derives revenue from originating, closing, selling and servicing predominantly agency-conforming loans, which are pooled and sold to the secondary market. The segment also includes title insurance, appraisals and settlement services complementing the Company s end-to-end mortgage origination experience. Servicing activities are fully allocated to the Direct to Consumer segment and are viewed as an extension of the client experience. Servicing enables Rocket Mortgage to establish and maintain long term relationships with our clients, through multiple touchpoints at regular engagement intervals. 
 
 Revenues in the Direct to Consumer segment are generated primarily from the gain on sale of loans, which includes loan origination fees, revenues associated with title insurance, appraisals and settlement services and revenues from sales of loans into the secondary market, as well as the fair value of originated MSRs and hedging gains and losses. Loan servicing income consists of the contractual fees earned for servicing loans and other ancillary servicing fees, as well as changes in the fair value of MSRs due to changes in valuation assumptions and realization of cash flows.

After evaluating the potential dilutive effect under the if-converted method, the outstanding Holdings Units for the assumed exchange of non-controlling interests were determined to be anti-dilutive and thus were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. The Holding Units were dilutive for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and therefore included in the earnings per share calculation.

Recent Developments 
 Business Trends 
 
 From January to September 2024, the U.S. inflation rate declined from 3.1 to 2.4 , progressing toward the Federal Reserve s target rate of 2 . In mid-September, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5.00 . Subsequent to quarter end, in November 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by an additional 25 basis points to 4.75 . Mortgage interest rates declined during the quarter, providing some relief to home affordability, however, rate volatility, constrained housing inventory, rising home prices and economic uncertainty persist, impacting both refinance and purchase origination activity across the industry.

For more information on Adjusted EBITDA, please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 To provide investors with information in addition to our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose Adjusted revenue, Adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share and Adjusted EBITDA (collectively our non-GAAP financial measures as non-GAAP measures which management believes provide useful information to investors. We believe that the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because each measure assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue, net income (loss), or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may define our non-GAAP financial measures differently, and as a result, our measures of our non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Our non-GAAP financial measures provide indicators of performance that are not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items. Accordingly, management believes that these measurements are useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period, and management relies on these measures for planning and forecasting of future periods. Additionally, these measures allow management to compare our results with those of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. 
 
 We define Adjusted revenue as total revenues net of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights MSRs due to valuation assumptions, net of hedges. We define Adjusted net income (loss) as tax-effected net income (loss) before share-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation assumptions, net of hedges, career transition program and the tax effects of those adjustments as applicable. We define Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share as Adjusted net income (loss) divided by the adjusted diluted weighted average shares outstanding which includes diluted weighted average Class A common stock and the assumed pro forma exchange and conversion of Class D common stock outstanding for the applicable period presented. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest and amortization expense on non-funding debt, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation assumptions, net of hedges and career transition program. 
 
 39 

We exclude from each of our non-GAAP financial measures the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation assumptions, net of hedges, as this represents a non-cash non-realized adjustment to our total revenues, reflecting changes in assumptions including discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, mostly due to changes in market interest rates, which is not indicative of our performance or results of operation. We also exclude effects of contractual prepayment protection associated with sales of MSRs. Adjusted EBITDA includes Interest expense on funding facilities, which are recorded as a component of Interest income, net, as these expenses are a direct cost driven by loan origination volume. By contrast, interest and amortization expense on non-funding debt is a function of our capital structure and is therefore excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. 
 
 Our definitions of each of our non-GAAP financial measures allow us to add back certain cash and non-cash charges, and deduct certain gains that are included in calculating Total revenue, net, Net (loss) income attributable to Rocket Companies or Net (loss) income. However, these expenses and gains vary greatly, and are difficult to predict. From time to time in the future, we may include or exclude other items if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors. 
 
 Although we use our non-GAAP financial measures to assess the performance of our business, such use is limited because they do not include certain material costs necessary to operate our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures can represent the effect of long-term strategies as opposed to short-term results. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. 
 
 Limitations to our non-GAAP financial measures included, but are not limited to: 
 
 (a) they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 
 (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payment on our debt; 
 
 (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and Adjusted revenue, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; and 
 
 (d) they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 We compensate for these limitations by using our non-GAAP financial measures along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. See below for reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Additionally, our U.S. GAAP-based measures can be found in the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.

Key Performance Indicators 
 
 We monitor a number of key performance indicators to evaluate the performance of our business operations. Our loan production key performance indicators enable us to monitor our ability to generate gain on sale revenue as well as understand how our performance compares to the total mortgage origination market. Our servicing portfolio key performance indicators enable us to monitor the overall size of our servicing portfolio of business, the related value of our mortgage servicing rights, and the health of the business as measured by the average MSR delinquency rate. Other key performance indicators for other Rocket Companies, besides Rocket Mortgage Other Rocket Companies , allow us to monitor both revenues and unit sales generated by these businesses. We include Rocket Money paid subscriptions, as we believe the metric is a key indicator of growth and revenue. We also include Rockethomes.com average unique monthly visits, as we believe traffic on the site is an indicator of consumer interest.

 (1) Gain on sale margin is calculated by dividing Gain on sale of loans, net by the net rate lock volume for the period. Gain on sale of loans, net includes the net gain on sale of loans, fair value of originated MSRs, fair value adjustments on originated loans held for sale and IRLC s and revaluation of forward commitments economically hedging loans held for sale and IRLCs. This metric is a measure of gain on sale revenue and excludes revenues from Rocket Loans, changes in the loan repurchase reserve and fair value adjustments on repurchased loans held on our balance sheet, such as early buyouts. 
 
 (2) MSR fair market value multiple is a metric used to determine the relative value of the MSR asset in relation to the annualized retained servicing fee, which is the cash that the holder of the MSR asset would receive from the portfolio as of such date. It is calculated as the quotient of (a) the MSR f air market value as of a specified date divided by (b) the weighted average annualized retained servicing fee for our MSR portfolio as of such date. The weighted average annualized retained servicing fee for our MSR portfolio was 0.28 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The vast majority of our portfolio consists of originated MSRs and consequent ly, the impact of purchased MSRs does not have a material impact on ou r weighted average service fee. 
 
 (3) This metric measures our retention across a greater percentage of our client bases versus our recapture rate. We define net client retention rate as the number of clients that were active at the beginning of a period and which remain active at the end of the period, divided by the number of clients that were active at the beginning of the period. This metric excludes clients whose loans were sold during the period as well as clients to whom we did not actively market to due to contractual prohibitions or other business reasons. We define active as those clients who do not pay-off their mortgage with us and originate a new mortgage with another lender during the period. 
 
 (4) Rockethomes.com average unique monthly visits is calculated by a third party service that monitors website and app engagement activity. This metric doesn't necessarily have a direct correlation to revenues and is used primarily to monitor consumer interest in the Rockethomes.com site and app. 
 
 44 

(5) Net revenue presented above is calculated as gross revenues less intercompany revenue eliminations, as a portion of the Select Other Rocket Companies revenues is generated through intercompany transactions. Consequently, we view gross revenue of individual Select Other Rocket Companies as a key performance indicator, and we consider net revenue of Select Other Rocket Companies on a combined basis. 

Description of Certain Components of Financial Data 
 
 Components of Revenue 
 
 Our sources of revenue include Gain on sale of loans, net , Loan servicing (loss) income, net , Interest income, net and Other income . 
 
 Gain on sale of loans, net 
 
 Gain on sale of loans, net includes all components related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans, including (1) net gain on sale of loans, which represents the premium we receive in excess of the loan principal amount and certain fees charged by investors upon sale of loans into the secondary market, (2) loan origination fees, credits, points and certain costs, (3) provision for or benefit from investor reserves, (4) the change in fair value of interest rate locks IRLCs or rate lock and loans held for sale, (5) the gain or loss on forward commitments hedging loans held for sale and IRLCs and (6) the fair value of originated MSRs. MSR assets are created at the time mortgage loans held for sale are securitized and sold to investors for cash, while the Company retains the right to service the loan. 
 
 Loan servicing (loss) income, net 
 Loan servicing fee income consists of the contractual fees earned for servicing the loans and includes ancillary revenue such as late fees and modification incentives. Loan servicing fee income is recorded to income as earned, which is upon collection of payments from borrowers. We have elected to measure the MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. Changes in fair value of MSRs, net primarily due to the realization of expected cash flows and/or changes in valuation inputs and estimates, are recognized in current period earnings. 
 
 Interest income, net 
 
 Interest income, net is interest earned on mortgage loans held for sale net of the interest expense paid on our loan funding facilities.

 (1) Net rate lock volume includes the UPB of loans subject to IRLCs, net of the pull-through factor as described in the Description of Certain Components of Financial Data section of our most recently filed Form10-K. 
 (2) Gain on sale margin is calculated by dividing Gain on sale of loans, net by the net rate lock volume for the period. Gain on sale of loans, net includes the net gain on sale of loans, fair value of originated MSRs, fair value adjustments on originated loans held for sale and IRLC s and revaluation of forward commitments economically hedging loans held for sale and IRLCs. This metric is a measure of gain on sale revenue and excludes revenues from Rocket Loans, changes in the loan repurchase reserve and fair value adjustments on repurchased loans held on our balance sheet, such as early buyouts. See the table above for each of the components of gain on sale of loans, net.

Overview of the Gain on sale of loans, net table 
 
 At the time an IRLC is issued, an estimate of the Gain on sale of loans, net is recognized in the Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs component in the table above. Subsequent changes in the fair value of IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale are recognized in this same component as the loan progresses through closing, which is the moment that loans move from an IRLC to a loan held for sale, and ultimately through the sale of the loan. We deploy a hedge strategy to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes from the point of the IRLC through the sale of the loan. The changes to the Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs in each period is dependent on several factors, including mortgage origination volume, how long a loan remains at a given stage in the origination process and the movement of interest rates during that period as compared to the immediately preceding period. Loans originated during an increasing rate environment generally decrease in value, and loans originated during a decreasing rate environment generally increase in value. When the mortgage loan is sold into the secondary market, any difference between the proceeds received and the current fair value of the loan is recognized and moves from the Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs component in the Net gain on sale of loans component in the table above. The Revaluation gain from forward commitments economically hedging loans held for sale and IRLCs component reflects the forward hedge commitments intended to offset the various fair value adjustments that impact the Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs and the Net gain on sale of loans components. As a result, these three components should be evaluated in combination when evaluating Gain on sale of loans, net, as the sum of these components are primarily driven by net rate lock volume. Furthermore, at the point of sale of the loan, the Fair value of originated MSRs and the Provision for investor reserves are recognized each in their respective components shown above. 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 summary 
 
 Gain on sale of loans, net was 844.4 million, an increase of 272.3 million, or 48 , compared to 572.1 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 43 increase in net rate lock volume, impacting Net gain on sale of loans, Fair value adjustment on loans held for sale and IRLCs, and Revaluation from forward commitments economically hedging loans held for sale and IRLCs. 
 
 The Fair value of originated MSRs was 337.7 million, an increase of 7.1 million, or 2 , when compared to 330.6 million for the same period in 2023, driven by an increase in sold loan volume, offset by a lower MSR fair value multiple during the period.

Summary Results by Segment for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Our operations are organized by distinct marketing channels which promote client acquisition and are categorized under two reportable segments: Direct to Consumer and Partner Network. In the Direct to Consumer segment, clients have the ability to interact with the Rocket Mortgage app and/or with our mortgage bankers, consisting of sales team members across our platform. We market to potential clients in this segment through various performance marketing channels. The Direct to Consumer segment derives revenue from originating, closing, selling and servicing predominantly agency-conforming loans, which are pooled and sold to the secondary market. This also includes providing title insurance services, appraisals and settlement services to these clients as part of our end-to-end mortgage origination experience. Servicing activities are fully allocated to the Direct to Consumer segment as they are viewed as an extension of the client experience with the primary objective to establish and maintain positive, regular touchpoints with our clients, which positions us to have high retention and recapture the clients next refinance, purchase and personal loan transactions. These activities position us to be the natural choice for clients next refinance or purchase transaction. 
 
 52 

The Rocket Professional platform supports our Partner Network segment, where we leverage our superior client service and widely recognized brand to grow marketing and influencer relationships, and our mortgage broker partnerships through Rocket Pro TPO. Our marketing partnerships consist of well-known consumer-focused companies that find value in our award-winning client experience and want to offer their clients mortgage solutions with our trusted, widely recognized brand. These organizations connect their clients directly to us through marketing channels and a referral process. Our influencer partnerships are typically with companies that employ licensed mortgage professionals that find value in our client experience, technology and efficient mortgage process, where mortgages may not be their primary offering. We also enable clients to start the mortgage process through the Rocket platform in the way that works best for them, including through a local mortgage broker. Rocket Pro TPO works exclusively with mortgage brokers, community banks and credit unions. Rocket Pro TPO s partners provide the face-to-face service their clients desire, while tapping into the expertise, technology and award-winning process of Rocket Mortgage. 
 
 We measure the performance of the segments primarily on a contribution margin basis. Contribution margin is intended to measure the direct profitability of each segment and is calculated as Adjusted revenue less directly attributable expenses. Adjusted revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure described above. Directly attributable expenses include Salaries, commissions and team member benefits, General and administrative expenses, Marketing and advertising expenses and Other expenses, such as direct servicing costs and origination costs. For segments, we measure gain on sale margin of sold loans and refer to this metric as sold loan gain on sale margin . A loan is considered sold when it is sold to investors on the secondary market. Sold loan gain on sale margin reflects the gain on sale revenue of loans sold into the secondary market divided by the sold loan volume for the period. By contrast, gain on sale margin , which we reference outside of the segment discussion, measures the gain on sale revenue, net divided by net rate lock volume for the period. See below for our overview and discussion of segment results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For additional discussion, see Note 11, Segments of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have included: 
 
 cash flow from our operations, including: 
 
 sale of whole loans into the secondary market; 
 
 sale of mortgage servicing rights and excess servicing cash flows into the secondary market; 
 
 loan origination fees; 
 
 servicing fee income; 
 
 interest income on loans held for sale; and 
 
 other income 
 
 borrowings, including under our funding facilities; financing facilities; unsecured senior notes; and 
 
 cash and marketable securities on hand. 
 
 Historically, our primary uses of funds have included: 
 
 origination of loans; 
 
 interest expense; 
 
 repayment of debt; 
 
 operating expenses; 
 
 acquisition of mortgage servicing rights; and 
 
 distributions to RHI including those to fund distributions for payment of taxes by RHI shareholders. 
 
 We are also subject to contingencies which may have a significant impact on the use of our cash. 
 
 55 

In order to originate and aggregate loans for sale into the secondary market, we use our own working capital and borrow or obtain money on a short-term basis primarily through committed and uncommitted funding facilities, generally established with large global banks. 
 
 Our funding facilities are primarily in the form of master repurchase agreements. We also have funding facilities directly with the GSEs. Loans financed under these facilities are generally financed at approximately 97 to 98 of the principal balance of the loan (although certain types of loans are financed at lower percentages of the principal balance of the loan), which requires us to fund the balance from cash generated from operations. Once closed, the underlying residential mortgage loan that is held for sale is pledged as collateral for the borrowing or advance that was made under these funding facilities. In most cases, the loans will remain in one of the funding facilities for only a short time, generally less than 45 days, until the loans are pooled and sold. During the time the loans are held for sale, we earn interest income from the borrower on the underlying mortgage loan. This income is partially offset by the interest and fees we have to pay under the funding facilities. 
 
 When we sell a pool of loans in the secondary market, the proceeds received from the sale of the loans are used to pay back the amounts we owe on the funding facilities. We rely on the cash generated from the sale of loans to fund future loans and repay borrowings under our funding facilities. Delays or failures to sell loans in the secondary market could have an adverse effect on our liquidity position. 
 
 As discussed in Note 5, Borrowings , of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2024, we had 16 different funding and financing facilities in different amounts and with various maturities together with the Senior Notes. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate available amount under our facilities was 21.5 billion, with combined outstanding balances of 8.6 billion and unutilized capacity of 12.9 billion. 
 
 The amount of financing actually advanced on each individual loan under our funding facilities, as determined by agreed upon advance rates, may be less than the stated advance rate depending, in part, on the market value of the mortgage loans securing the financings. Each of our funding facilities allows the bank providing the funds to evaluate the market value of the loans that are serving as collateral for the borrowings or advances being made. If the bank determines that the value of the collateral has decreased, the bank can require us to provide additional collateral or reduce the amount outstanding with respect to those loans (e.g., initiate a margin call). Our inability or unwillingness to satisfy the request could result in the termination of the facilities and possible default under our other funding facilities. In addition, a large unanticipated margin call could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. 
 
 The amount owed and outstanding on our funding facilities fluctuates significantly based on our origination volume, the amount of time it takes us to sell the loans we originate and the amount of loans being self-funded with cash. We may from time to time use surplus cash to buy-down the effective interest rate of certain funding facilities or to self-fund a portion of our loan originations. Buy-down funds are included in Cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have the ability to withdraw these funds at any time, unless a margin call has been made or a default has occurred under the relevant facilities. We will also deploy cash to self-fund loan originations, a portion of which can be transferred to a warehouse line or the early buy out line, provided that such loans meet the eligibility criteria to be placed on such lines. 
 
 We remain in a strong liquidity position, with total liquidity of 8.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, which includes 1.2 billion of Cash and cash equivalents, 1.8 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations, a portion of which could be transferred to funding facilities (warehouse lines) at our discretion, 3.3 billion of undrawn lines of credit from financing facilities, and 2.0 billion of undrawn MSR lines. Margin cash held on behalf of counterparties is recorded in Cash and cash equivalents, and the related liability is classified in Other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Margin cash pledged to counterparties is excluded from Cash and cash equivalents and instead recorded in Other assets, as a receivable, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Our funding facilities, early buy out facilities, MSRs facilities and unsecured lines of credit also generally require us to comply with certain operating and financial covenants and the availability of funds under these facilities is subject to, among other conditions, our continued compliance with these covenants. These financial covenants include, but are not limited to, maintaining (1) a certain minimum tangible net worth, (2) minimum liquidity, (3) a maximum ratio of total liabilities or total debt to tangible net worth and (4) pre-tax net income requirements. A breach of these covenants can result in an event of default under these facilities and as such allows the lenders to pursue certain remedies. In addition, each of these facilities, as well as our unsecured lines of credit, includes cross default or cross acceleration provisions that could result in all facilities terminating if an event of default or acceleration of maturity occurs under any facility. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Our Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash were 1.2 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 256.7 million, or 26 , compared to 991.9 million at September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by less corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations, partially offset by the increase in MSR purchases during the period. 
 
 Equity 
 
 Equity was 8.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 154.0 million, or 2 , compared to 8.5 billion as of September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of net loss of 245.5 million, partially offset by share-based compensation expense of 141.2 million. 
 
 Distributions 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no material dividend or tax distributions. Except for tax distributions, these distributions are at the discretion of our board of directors. 

Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Other Contingencies 
 
 There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our outstanding contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 from information and amounts previously disclosed as of December 31, 2023 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Other Contingencies . Refer to Notes 5, Borrowings and 9, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees , of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of contractual obligations, commercial commitments and other contingencies, including legal contingencies. 
 
 New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective 
 See Note 1, Business, Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 There have been no material changes to the Company's exposure to market risks since what was disclosed in the Company's December 31, 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

57 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in our management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Because of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. The litigation process is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. However, in the opinion of our management, matters pending or threatened against us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Note 9 Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, to the condensed consolidated financial statements under the heading Legal included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for legal proceedings and related matters. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There are certain risks and uncertainties in our business that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. We included a detailed discussion of our risk factors in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. Our risk factors have not changed significantly from those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. These risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and in connection with the forward-looking statements and other information contained in this Quarterly Report 2024 Form 10-Q. Any of the risks described in our 2023 Form 10-K could materially affect our business, condensed consolidated financial condition or future results and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made. The risk factors described in our 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, condensed consolidated financial condition and/or future results.

All parties to this Agreement agree to such treatment and agree to take no action inconsistent with this treatment, unless required by law. 
 (h) If Buyer requests compensation under this Section 5 , or requires Seller to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to Buyer or any Governmental Authority for the account of Buyer pursuant to Section 5 , then Buyer shall (at the request of Seller) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking the Transactions hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of Buyer, such designation or assignment (A) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 5 , as the case may be, in the future, and (B) would not subject Buyer to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to Buyer. Seller hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with any such designation or assignment. 

34 

(i) If Seller is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to Buyer or any Governmental Authority for the account of Buyer pursuant to Section 5 and, in each case, Buyer has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 5(h) , then Seller may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to Buyer, require Buyer to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 36 ), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 5 and obligations under this Agreement and the related Program Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Buyer shall not require Seller to satisfy a Margin Call with respect to that portion of the related Margin Deficit that occurs solely as a result of a reduction in the Market Value of one or more Underlying Loans and no such Margin Call shall be required to be made in respect of such portion unless the Margin Deficit attributable to such reduction in Market Value shall equal or exceed the Margin Threshold, as determined by Buyer in its reasonable good faith discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, the Margin Threshold shall not apply to that portion of a Margin Deficit attributable solely to a reduction in the Applicable Percentage of an Underlying Loan in accordance with the definition thereof. 
 (c) Buyer s election, in its sole and absolute discretion, not to make a Margin Call at any time there is a Margin Deficit will not in any way limit or impair its right to make a Margin Call at any time a Margin Deficit exists. 
 (d) Any cash transferred to Buyer pursuant to Section 6(b) above will be applied by Buyer as follows (1) with respect to that portion of the Margin Deficit attributable to a reduction in the Applicable Percentage of an Underlying Loan (if any), to the repayment of the Repurchase Price of outstanding Transactions pursuant to Section 4(b) and (2) with respect to that portion of the Margin Deficit attributable to a reduction in Market Value of the Underlying Loans (if any), to be applied by Buyer in such manner as Buyer determines to eliminate the Margin Deficit.

62 

single or partial exercise by Buyer of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

 40. SERVICING 
 (a) Subject to subsection (d) below, Pledgor covenants to maintain or cause the servicing of the Purchased Assets to be maintained in conformity with Accepted Servicing Practices and pursuant to the related underlying Servicing Agreement, if any. In the event that the preceding language is interpreted as constituting one or more servicing contracts, each such servicing contract shall terminate automatically upon the earliest of (i) the termination thereof of Buyer pursuant to subsection (g) below, (ii) the date on which all the Obligations have been paid in full, or (iii) the transfer of servicing to any entity approved by Buyer and the assumption thereof by such entity. 

73 

(b) During the period Pledgor is servicing the Purchased Assets for Buyer, (i) Pledgor agrees that Buyer is the owner of all Servicing Records relating to Purchased Assets that have not been repurchased, including but not limited to any and all servicing agreements, files, documents, records, data bases, computer tapes, copies of computer tapes, proof of insurance coverage, insurance policies, appraisals, other closing documentation, payment history records, and any other records relating to or evidencing the servicing of such Loans (the Servicing Records ), and (ii) Pledgor grants Buyer a security interest in all servicing fees and rights relating to the Purchased Assets that have not been repurchased and all Servicing Records to secure the obligation of Pledgor or its designee to service in conformity with this Section 40 and any other obligation of Pledgor to Buyer. At all times during the term of this Agreement, Pledgor covenants to hold such Servicing Records in trust for Buyer and to safeguard, or cause each Subservicer to safeguard, such Servicing Records and to deliver them, or cause any such Subservicer to deliver them to the extent permitted under the related Servicing Agreement promptly to Buyer or its designee (including the Custodian) at Buyer s reasonable request. It is understood and agreed by the parties that prior to an Event of Default, Pledgor, as servicer shall retain the servicing fees with respect to the Purchased Assets. 
 (c) If any Loan that is proposed to be sold on a Purchase Date is serviced by a servicer other than Pledgor (a Subservicer ), or if the servicing of any Purchased Asset is to be transferred to a Subservicer, Pledgor shall provide a copy of the related servicing agreement and an Instruction Letter executed by such Subservicer (collectively, the Servicing Agreement to Buyer at least one (1) Business Day prior to such Purchase Date or transfer date, as applicable, which Servicing Agreement shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer. In addition, Pledgor shall have obtained the prior written consent of Buyer for such Subservicer to subservice the Loans, which consent may not unreasonably be withheld or delayed. 
 (d) After the Purchase Date, until the Repurchase Date, Pledgor will have no right to modify or alter the terms of the Loan or consent to the modification or alteration of the terms of any Loan, except as required by law, Agency Guidelines, FHA Regulations, requirements for VA Loans, Rural Housing Service Regulations, Accepted Servicing Practices, any Program Documents or other requirements, and Pledgor will have no obligation or right to repossess any Loan or substitute another Loan, except as provided in any Custodial Agreement or any Program Document, including, without limitation, Section 16 of this Agreement. 
 (e) Pledgor shall permit Buyer to inspect upon reasonable prior written notice at a mutually convenient time Pledgor s servicing facilities, as the case may be, for the purpose of satisfying Buyer that Pledgor has the ability to service the Loans as provided in this Agreement. In addition, with respect to any Subservicer which is not an Affiliate of Pledgor, Pledgor shall use its best efforts to enable Buyer to inspect the servicing facilities of such Subservicer. 
 (f) Pledgor retains no economic rights to the servicing of the Purchased Assets provided that Pledgor shall continue to service the Purchased Assets hereunder as part of its Obligations hereunder. As such, Pledgor expressly acknowledges that the Purchased Assets are sold to Buyer on a servicing released basis. At the request of Buyer, Pledgor will furnish to Buyer monthly electronic Loan performance data, including, without limitation, delinquency reports (i.e., delinquency, foreclosure and net charge-off reports). 
 (g) The Pledgor s rights and obligations to interim service the Underlying Loans shall terminate on the twentieth (20 th day of each calendar month (and if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), unless otherwise directed in writing by the Buyer prior to such date. For purposes of this provision, notice provided by electronic mail shall constitute written notice. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause (g) shall no longer apply to any Underlying Loan that is repurchased in 

74 

full by Seller in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and therefore is no longer subject to a Transaction. Upon termination, the Servicer shall transfer servicing, including, without limitation, delivery of all servicing files to the designee of the Buyer. The Pledgor s delivery of servicing files shall be in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices. The Seller and Pledgor shall have no right to select a subservicer or successor servicer. After the servicing terminates and until the servicing transfer date, the Pledgor shall service the Underlying Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and for the benefit of the Buyer. Servicer shall hold or cause to be held all Escrow Payments collected with respect to the Purchased Assets it is subservicing on behalf of Buyer in segregated accounts for the sole benefit of the Mortgagors and shall apply the same for the purposes for which such funds were collected. If Servicer should discover that, for any reason whatsoever, it has failed to perform fully its servicing obligations with respect to the Purchased Assets it is subservicing on behalf of Buyer, Pledgor shall promptly notify Buyer. 
 41. PERIODIC DUE DILIGENCE REVIEW 
 Seller acknowledges that Buyer has the right to perform continuing due diligence reviews with respect to the Purchased Assets and Seller, for purposes of verifying compliance with the representations, warranties, covenants and specifications made hereunder or under any other Program Document, or otherwise, and Seller agrees that upon reasonable (but no less than five (5) Business Days prior notice to Seller (provided that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or an Event of Default, no such prior notice shall be required), Buyer or its authorized representatives will be permitted during normal business hours to examine, inspect, make copies of, and make extracts of, the Mortgage Files, the Servicing Records and any and all documents, records, agreements, instruments or information relating to such Purchased Assets in the possession, or under the control, of Seller and or the Custodian. Provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Buyer agrees that it shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts, in the conduct of any such due diligence, to minimize any disruption to Seller s normal course of business. Seller also shall make available to Buyer a knowledgeable financial or accounting officer for the purpose of answering questions respecting the Mortgage Files and the Purchased Assets. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller acknowledges that Buyer shall purchase Loans from Seller based solely upon the information provided by Seller to Buyer in the Loan Schedule and the representations, warranties and covenants contained herein, and that Buyer, at its option, has the right, at any time to conduct a partial or complete due diligence review on some or all of the Purchased Assets, including, without limitation, ordering new broker s price opinions, new credit reports, new appraisals on the related Mortgaged Properties and otherwise re-generating the information used to originate such Loan. Buyer may underwrite such Loans itself or engage a mutually agreed upon third party underwriter to perform such underwriting. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer and any third party underwriter in connection with such underwriting, including, but not limited to, providing Buyer and any third party underwriter with reasonable access to any and all documents, records, agreements, instruments or information relating to such Purchased Assets in the possession, or under the control, of Seller. In addition, Buyer has the right to perform continuing Due Diligence Reviews of Purchased Assets for purposes of verifying compliance with the representations, warranties, covenants and specifications made hereunder or under any other Program Document, or otherwise. Seller and Buyer further agree that all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with Buyer s activities pursuant to this Section 41 shall be paid by Seller subject to the limitations of Section 22(b) of this Agreement and that, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Buyer shall be limited to one (1) on-site visits in any calendar year unless agreed to by Seller. 
 42. SET-OFF 
 In addition to any rights and remedies of Buyer provided by this Agreement and by law, Buyer shall have the right, without prior notice to Seller (except for such notice and right to cure as may be 

75 

specifically provided hereunder in connection with certain Events of Default), any such notice being expressly waived by Seller to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by Seller hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all Property and deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by Buyer to or for the credit or the account of Seller only to the extent specifically relating to this Agreement, the other Program Documents or the Transactions described hereunder. Buyer may set-off cash, the proceeds of the liquidation of any Purchased Items and all other sums or obligations owed by Buyer to Seller, against all of Seller s obligations to Buyer, under this Agreement or under any other Program Documents, if such obligations of Seller are then due, without prejudice to Buyer s right to recover any deficiency. Buyer agrees promptly to notify Seller after any such set-off and application made by Buyer provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

Schedule 1 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RE UNDERLYING LOANS 
 Underlying Loans 
 For purposes of this Schedule 1 and the representations and warranties set forth herein, a breach of a representation or warranty will be deemed to have been cured with respect to a Loan if and when Pledgor has taken or caused to be taken action such that the event, circumstance or condition that gave rise to such breach no longer adversely affects such Loan. Pledgor represents and warrants to Buyer that as to each Loan, except for any Loan that is a Scratch and Dent Mortgage Loan, that is subject to a Transaction hereunder, Pledgor hereby makes the following representations and warranties to Buyer as of the Purchase Date and as of each date such Loan is subject to a Transaction 
 (a) Loans as Described . The information set forth in the Loan Schedule with respect to the Loan is complete, true and correct in all material respects as of the Purchase Date. 
 (b) Payments Current . No payment required under the Loan is or more delinquent nor has any payment under the Loan been or more delinquent at any time since the origination of the Loan. 
 (c) No Outstanding Charges . There are no defaults in complying with the terms of the Mortgage, and, other than with respect to Second Lien Loans, all taxes, governmental assessments, insurance premiums, water, sewer and municipal charges, leasehold payments or ground rents which previously became due and owing have been paid or are not delinquent, or an escrow of funds (for Loans other than Cooperative Loans) has been established in an amount sufficient to pay for every such item which remains unpaid and which has been assessed but is not yet due and payable and delinquent. Pledgor has not advanced funds, or induced, solicited or knowingly received any advance of funds by a party other than the Mortgagor, directly or indirectly, for the payment of any amount required under the Loan (other than a Second Lien Loan), except for interest accruing from the date of the Note or date of disbursement of the Loan proceeds, whichever is earlier, to the day which precedes by one month the Due Date of the first installment of principal and interest. 
 (d) Original Terms Unmodified . The terms of the Note and Mortgage have not been impaired, waived, altered or modified in any respect, from the date of origination except by a written instrument which has been recorded, if necessary to protect the interests of Buyer, and which has been delivered to the Custodian or to such other Person as Buyer shall designate in writing, and the terms of which are reflected in the Loan Schedule. The substance of any such waiver, alteration or modification has been approved by the issuer of any related PMI Policy and the title insurer, if any, to the extent required by the policy, and, with respect to RHS Loans, has been approved by the RHS to the extent required by the Rural Housing Service Guaranty, and its terms are reflected on the Loan Schedule, if applicable. No Mortgagor has been released, in whole or in part, except in connection with an assumption agreement, approved by the issuer of any related PMI Policy and the title insurer, to the extent required by the policy, and with respect to any RHS Loan, the RHS to the extent required by the Rural Housing Service Guaranty, and which assumption agreement is part of the Mortgage File delivered to the Custodian or to such other Person as Buyer shall designate in writing and the terms of which are reflected in the Loan Schedule. 
 (e) No Defenses . The Note and the Mortgage are not subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including without limitation the defense of usury, nor will the 
 
 Schedule 1-1 

operation of any of the terms of the Note or the Mortgage, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render either the Note or the Mortgage unenforceable, in whole or in part, or subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including without limitation the defense of usury and no such right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto, and no Mortgagor was a debtor in any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding at, or subsequent to, the time the Loan was originated. 
 (f) Hazard Insurance . Pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage, all buildings or other improvements upon the Mortgaged Property (other than Mortgaged Property subject to a Second Lien Loan) are insured by a generally acceptable insurer against loss by fire, hazards covered by extended coverage insurance and such other hazards as are provided for in the applicable Agency, FHA, VA, RHS or HUD guidelines, as well as all additional requirements set forth in the Agency Guidelines or Pledgor s Underwriting Guidelines. With respect to Mortgaged Property subject to a Second Lien Loan, on the origination date such Mortgaged Property was covered by a generally acceptable insurer against loss by fire, hazards covered by extended coverage insurance and such other hazards as are provided for in the applicable Agency, FHA, VA, RHS or HUD guidelines, as well as all additional requirements set forth in the Agency Guidelines or Pledgor s Underwriting Guidelines. If required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, the related Mortgaged Property is covered by a flood insurance policy meeting the applicable requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration as in effect which policy conforms to the applicable Agency, FHA, VA, RHS or HUD guidelines or Pledgor s Underwriting Guidelines. All individual insurance policies (other than individual insurance policies relating to Second Lien Loans) contain a standard mortgagee clause naming Pledgor and its successors and assigns as mortgagee, and all premiums due and owing thereon have been paid. The Mortgage (other than Mortgages related to Second Lien Loans) obligates the Mortgagor thereunder to maintain all such insurance policies at the Mortgagor s cost and expense, and on the Mortgagor s failure to do so, authorizes the holder of the Mortgage to obtain and maintain such insurance at such Mortgagor s cost and expense, and to seek reimbursement therefor from the Mortgagor. Where required by state law or regulation, the Mortgagor has been given an opportunity to choose the carrier of the required hazard insurance, provided the policy is not a master or blanket hazard insurance policy covering a condominium, or any hazard insurance policy covering the common facilities of a planned unit development. The hazard insurance policy is the valid and binding obligation of the insurer and is in full force and effect. Pledgor has not engaged in, and has no knowledge of the Mortgagor s having engaged in, any act or omission which would impair the coverage of any such policy, the benefits of the endorsement provided for herein, or the validity and binding effect of such policy, including, without limitation, to Pledgor s knowledge, no unlawful fee, commission, kickback or other unlawful compensation or value of any kind has been or will be received, retained or realized by any attorney, firm or other person or entity, and no such unlawful items have been received, retained or realized by Pledgor, in any case, to the extent it would impair coverage under any such policy. 
 (g) Compliance with Applicable Law . Any and all requirements of any federal, state or local law including, without limitation, usury, truth-in-lending, real estate settlement procedures, consumer credit protection, anti-predatory lending laws, laws covering fair housing, fair credit reporting, community reinvestment, homeowners equity protection, equal credit opportunity, mortgage reform and disclosure laws or unfair and deceptive practices laws applicable to the origination and servicing of such Loan have been complied with in all material respects, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not involve the violation of any such laws or regulations. Pledgor shall maintain in its possession, available for Buyer s inspection, evidence of compliance with all requirements set forth herein. 
 
 Schedule 1-2 

(h) No Satisfaction of Mortgage . The Mortgage has not been satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded (except with respect to subordination of a Second Lien Loan to the first priority lien or security interest), in whole or in part, and the Mortgaged Property has not been released from the lien of the Mortgage, in whole or in part, nor has any instrument been executed that would effect any such satisfaction, cancellation, subordination or rescission (except with respect to subordination of a Second Lien Loan to the first priority lien or security interest) other than in the case of a release of a portion of the land comprising a Mortgaged Property or a release of a blanket Mortgage which release will not cause the Loan to fail to satisfy the applicable Agency Guidelines. Pledgor has not waived the performance by the Mortgagor of any action, if the Mortgagor s failure to perform such action would cause the Loan to be in default, nor has Pledgor waived any default resulting from any action or inaction by the Mortgagor. 
 (i) Valid Lien . Each Mortgage is a valid and subsisting First Lien (or with respect to a Second Lien Loan, a Second Lien) on a single parcel or multiple contiguous parcels of real estate included in the Mortgaged Property, including all buildings and improvements on the Mortgaged Property and all installations and mechanical, electrical, plumbing, heating and air conditioning systems annexed to such buildings, and all additions, alterations and replacements made at any time with respect to the foregoing, subject in all cases to the exceptions to title set forth in the title insurance policy with respect to the related Loan, which exceptions are generally acceptable to prudent mortgage lending companies, the exceptions set forth below and such other exceptions to which similar properties are commonly subject and which do not individually, or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect the benefits of the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage. The lien of the Mortgage is subject to 
 (i) the lien of current real property taxes and assessments not yet delinquent. 
 (ii) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of the public record as of the date of recording acceptable to prudent mortgage lending institutions generally and specifically referred to in the lender s title insurance policy delivered to the originator of the Loan and (a) referred to or otherwise considered in the appraisal made for the originator of the Loan or (b) which do not adversely affect the Appraised Value of the Mortgaged Property set forth in such appraisal 
 (iii) other matters to which like properties are commonly subject which do not materially interfere with the benefits of the security intended to be provided by the Mortgage or the use, enjoyment, value or marketability of the related Mortgaged Property, and which will not prevent realization of the full benefits of any Rural Housing Service Guaranty and 
 (iv) with respect to Second Lien Loans, the related first lien Mortgage. 
 Any security agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent document related to and delivered in connection with the Loan establishes and creates a valid, subsisting, enforceable and First Lien and first priority security interest (or with respect to a Second Lien Loan, Second Lien) on the property described therein and Pledgor has full right to pledge and assign the same to Buyer. 
 (j) Validity of Mortgage Documents . The Note and the Mortgage and any other agreement executed and delivered by a Mortgagor in connection with a Loan are genuine (or in the case of an eNote, the copy of the eNote transmitted to Custodian s eVault is the Authoritative Copy), and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the maker thereof enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization and other laws of general application affecting the rights of creditors and by general equitable principles. All parties to the Note, the Mortgage 
 
 Schedule 1-3 

and any other such related agreement had legal capacity to enter into the Loan and to execute and deliver the Note, the Mortgage and any such agreement, and the Note, the Mortgage and any other such related agreement have been duly and properly executed by other the applicable related parties. No fraud or error, omission, misrepresentation, negligence or similar occurrence with respect to a Loan has taken place on the part of any Person, including without limitation, the Mortgagor, any appraiser, any builder or developer, or any other party involved in the origination or servicing of the Loan or in any mortgage or flood insurance, if applicable, in relation to such Loan. Pledgor has reviewed all of the documents constituting the Mortgage File and has made such inquiries as they deem necessary to make and confirm the accuracy of the representations set forth herein. 
 (k) Full Disbursement of Proceeds . The Loan has been closed and the proceeds of the Loan have been fully disbursed to or for the account of the Mortgagor and there is no further requirement for future advances thereunder and any and all requirements as to completion of any on-site or off-site improvement and as to disbursements of any escrow funds therefor have been complied with. All costs, fees and expenses incurred in making or closing the Loan and the recording of the Mortgage were paid or are in the process of being paid, and the Mortgagor is not entitled to any refund of any amounts paid or due under the Note or Mortgage (excluding refunds that may result from escrow analysis adjustments). 
 (l) Ownership . Pledgor is the sole owner and holder of the Participation Interest and the indebtedness evidenced by each Note and upon the sale of the Participation Interest to Buyer, Seller shall retain or cause Pledgor to retain the Mortgage Files or any part thereof with respect thereto not delivered to the Custodian, Buyer or Buyer s designee, in trust for the purpose of servicing and supervising the servicing of each Loan. Each sale of the Loan from any prior owner or Pledgor was in exchange for fair equivalent value, and the prior owner or Pledgor, as applicable, was solvent both prior to and after the transfer and had sufficient capital to pay and was able to pay its debts as they would generally mature. Immediately prior to the transfer and assignment to the Buyer as of the origination date, the Loan, including the Note and the Mortgage, was not subject to an assignment or pledge, and Pledgor had good and marketable title to and was the sole owner thereof and had full right to transfer and sell the Loan to the Buyer free and clear of any encumbrance, equity, lien, pledge, charge, claim or security interest. Pledgor has the full right and authority subject to no interest or participation of, or agreement with, any other party, to sell and assign the Loan pursuant to this Agreement and following the sale of the Loan, the Buyer will own such Loan free and clear of any encumbrance, equity, participation interest, lien, pledge, charge, claim or security interest. Pledgor intends to relinquish all rights to possess, control and monitor the Loan, except for purposes of servicing the Loan as set forth in this Agreement. 
 (m) Doing Business . All parties which have had any interest in the Loan, whether as mortgagee, assignee, pledgee or otherwise, are (or, during the period in which they held and disposed of such interest, were) (i) in compliance with any and all applicable licensing requirements of the laws of the state wherein the Mortgaged Property is located, and (ii) either (A) organized under the laws of such state, (B) qualified to do business in such state, (C) a federal savings and loan association, a savings bank or a national bank having a principal office in such state, (D) not doing business in such state, or (E) not otherwise required to be qualified to do business in such state. 
 (n) Title Insurance .
