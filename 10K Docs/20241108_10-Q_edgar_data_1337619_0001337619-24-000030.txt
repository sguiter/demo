However, the Company corrected this immaterial error in the prior period reported within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

 Goodwill Impairment 
 
 Due to a strategic shift of business priorities for the Envestnet Data Analytics segment, which was considered an event or change in circumstance that required an assessment of goodwill for impairment as of June 30, 2024, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for the reporting unit to determine whether there was an impairment as of June 30, 2024.

Due to a change in circumstance for the customer, the estimated recoverable value of the loan was reassessed during the third quarter of 2024, which resulted in the recognition of a million non-cash impairment charge within the Envestnet Data Analytics reporting unit in general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

As of September 30, 2024, million aggregate principal of the Convertible Notes due 2025 remained outstanding.

Due to a clerical error, the restrictive legend was not removed until June 18, 2022. As a result of its failure to remove the legend on a timely basis, the Company was required to pay certain amounts of Additional Interest and interest thereon after February 15, 2022.

The event of default under the Indenture was cured with the payment of an immaterial amount of Additional Interest, as well as certain penalties, in August 2024. In addition, the event of default under the Indenture resulted in an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility due to a cross-default provision in the Revolving Credit Facility. The resulting event of default was waived by the required lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in August 2024. As a result, any and all existing defaults and events of default that had arisen or may have arisen therefrom were cured and the Company was in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility as of August 9, 2024, and continues to be in compliance as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In connection with the Merger, on October 2, 2024, subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company gave notice to the Trustees and holders of the Convertible Notes due 2025 and Convertible Notes due 2027 that the Merger constitutes a Fundamental Change and a Make Whole Fundamental Change under each of the indentures under which the Convertible Notes were issued and that the Convertible Notes due 2025 and Convertible Notes due 2027 may be surrendered by the holders for

 Under ASC 740-270-25, the Company is required to report income tax expense by applying a projected AETR to ordinary pre-tax book income for the interim period. The tax impact of discrete items is accounted for separately in the period in which they occur. The ETR for the quarter is the result of the projected AETR applied to actual pre-tax book income plus discrete items as a percentage of pre-tax book income. Therefore, a change in pre-tax book income, either forecasted or actual year-to-date, from one period to the next will cause the ETR to change. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance the Company has placed on a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets which includes the impact of IRC Section 174, permanent book-tax differences, uncertain tax positions and the impact of state and local taxes offset by federal and state R D credits.

 of the state-law claims. On August 5, 2021, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss, and dismissed the Company from the lawsuit. On October 8, 2021, Yodlee filed an early motion for summary judgment. On August 12, 2022, Plaintiffs moved for leave to file a third amended complaint, which Yodlee opposed. On September 29, 2022, the Court denied Plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint. On December 13, 2022, the Court granted in part and denied in part Yodlee s early motion for summary judgment, narrowing the scope of issues that remain to be resolved. On January 30, 2023, the Court granted Yodlee s motion for reconsideration and dismissed additional claim. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 19, 2023, which Yodlee answered on October 3, 2023. Discovery is closed. 
 
 On May 22, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. After full briefing and a hearing, the Court issued an order on September 25, 2024, denying plaintiffs motion for class certification in its entirety. On October 9, 2024, plaintiffs petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for permission to take an early appeal from that order under Rule 23(f). Yodlee opposed the petition on October 21, 2024, and plaintiffs sought permission to file a reply brief in support of their petition on October 28, 2024. The parties are awaiting the Ninth Circuit s ruling on plaintiffs petition. The district court held a further case management conference on October 21, 2024, and set a new schedule whereby Yodlee s pending motion for summary judgment, and any cross-motion for summary judgment by plaintiffs, will be heard by December 16, 2024. Plaintiffs have also stated their intent to file a motion by November 29, 2024, for leave to amend to add new proposed class representatives. Yodlee believes the allegations and remaining individual claims are without merit and will continue to vigorously defend itself both in the district court and in any appeal.

On August 23, 2024, the Company filed the Proxy Statement with the SEC. On September 5, 2024 and September 6, 2024, respectively, two separate complaints with nearly identical claims were filed by purported stockholders in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York against the Company and its directors (i) under the caption Eric Miller v. Envestnet, Inc., et al., Case No. 654622/2024 and (ii) under the caption Kevin Turner v. Envestnet, Inc., et al., Case No. 654641/2024. The complaints allege that the Proxy Statement omitted certain purportedly material information regarding, among other things, the background of the Merger, the Company s financial projections, and Morgan Stanley Co., LLC s financial analyses in violation of New York common law. The complaints seek, among other things, an injunction enjoining consummation of the Merger or, in the event that the Merger is consummated, damages resulting from the alleged violations. In addition, several purported stockholders of the Company have sent demand letters generally alleging that the preliminary proxy statement the Company filed on August 12, 2024 and/or the Proxy Statement omitted information that rendered it false and misleading or otherwise had disclosure deficiencies in violation of federal securities law.

Recent Developments 
 
 Plan of Merger 
 
 On July 11, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with BCPE Pequod Buyer, Inc., a Delaware corporation Parent ), and BCPE Pequod Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent Merger Sub ). Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of vehicles managed or advised by Bain Capital Private Equity, LP. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the Merger ). 
 
 The Company's Board has unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) determined that the terms of Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Company s shareholders, (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the Company s shareholders in accordance with the Merger Agreement, and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, resolved to recommend that the Company s shareholders approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. 
 
 Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, upon the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), each share of common stock, par value 0.005 per share, of the Company (the Common Shares that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Common Shares (i) owned by Parent (or any of its Affiliates), Merger Sub or the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Parent (or any of its Affiliates), Merger Sub or the Company, (ii) that are Rollover Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (iii) held in treasury of the Company, and (iv) as to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised in accordance with Delaware law), will be automatically cancelled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive 63.15, without interest thereon. 
 
 On September 24, 2024 the Company announced that, at a special meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the Merger. The closing of the Merger is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the remaining customary closing conditions. 
 
 If the Merger is consummated, the Common Shares will be delisted from The New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 
 Due to a strategic shift of business priorities for the Envestnet Data Analytics segment, which was considered an event or change in circumstance that required an assessment of goodwill for impairment as of June 30, 2024, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for the reporting unit to determine whether there was an impairment as of June 30, 2024. The impairment test identified that the carrying value of the Envestnet Data Analytics reporting unit exceeded its fair value, which resulted in the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge to goodwill of 96.3 million in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the second quarter of 2024. Although the Company recorded this impairment charge during the second quarter of 2024, future charges may occur if certain estimates and assumptions change significantly, and such charges could be material. 
 
 Deconsolidation of Non-Controlling Interest 
 
 Effective April 1, 2024, the Company no longer had majority representation of a private company's board and therefore no longer had a controlling financial interest in the private company. This resulted in the deconsolidation of this private company's assets, liabilities and results of operations and the recognition of a 19.5 million non-cash gain included within gain on deconsolidation in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the second quarter of 2024. This transaction did not represent a strategic shift and therefore did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. The Company applied the equity method to account for its non-controlling investment in this private company starting April 1, 2024 and the fair value of the investment of 41.9 million was included within investments in unconsolidated entities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2024.

Internally Developed Software, Net 
 
 Due to a change in technology needs of the business, 1.3 million and 14.2 million of net capitalized internally developed software costs, the majority of which was included within the Envestnet Wealth Solutions segment, was written off and included within depreciation and amortization expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Leadership Update 
 
 On January 7, 2024, the Company entered into a separation and release agreement with Mr. Crager in which it was agreed that Mr. Crager would step down as chief executive officer on March 31, 2024 and as a member of the Company s Board of Directors promptly following Envestnet s 2024 Annual Meeting. On April 1, 2024, Mr. Crager began serving as a senior advisor, focusing on client and partner relationships. James Fox began serving as our Interim Chief Executive Officer on April 1, 2024 and will continue to serve this role until our Board of Directors appoints a new chief executive officer. Mr. Fox has served as a member of our Board of Directors since February 2015 and Chair of the Board of Directors since March 2020. 
 
 Operating Results 
 
 Beginning in the three months ended December 31, 2021 through September 30, 2024, the Company reported a loss from operations and loss before income tax provision (benefit) in every quarter with the exception of the three months ended September 30, 2023, March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024. We incurred these quarterly losses as a result of several factors as described below. 
 
 Revenue Factors: Throughout 2022, the financial markets experienced a broad downturn and our redemption rates were higher than our historical average, and as a result, in our Envestnet Wealth Solutions segment, our asset-based recurring revenue was materially adversely affected. Beginning in the three months ended March 31, 2023 asset-based recurring revenue has been increasing steadily. In addition, as a result of competitive pricing pressures in our Envestnet Data Analytics segment research business, beginning in the three months ended December 31, 2022 subscription-based recurring revenue has been materially adversely affected. 
 
 Expense Factors: We have incurred certain expenses that are not recurring in nature and that are a direct result of significant, distinct enterprise-wide strategic initiatives that we have taken in order to reshape and streamline the organization, which we believe will increase our operational efficiencies and to reduce future operating expenses, while negatively impacting our operating results in the short-term. These actions include both internal and external related expenses associated with office closures announced in the second quarter of 2022, severance and office closure related expenses associated with an organizational realignment and entry into an outsourcing arrangement announced in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as severance expense for a reduction in force initiative announced in the first quarter of 2023 which continued throughout 2023. In addition, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge to goodwill of 96.3 million and wrote off 14.2 million of net capitalized internally developed software costs included within depreciation and amortization expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our business is directly and indirectly affected by macroeconomic conditions and the state of global financial markets. The return to recurring positive income before income taxes, largely depends on a combination of improved industry dynamics, including overall technology and data spending by financial institutions and an improvement in capital market valuations, including asset flows and redemption rates, both of which are outside of the Company s control, as well as a reduction in future operating expenses, as a result of the actions taken by management as discussed above.

Income tax provision (benefit) 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our effective tax rate of 238.1 and 234.2 , respectively, differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance the Company has placed on a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets which includes the impact of IRC Section 174, permanent book-tax differences, uncertain tax positions and the impact of state and local taxes offset by federal and state R D credits. 
 
 In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development released Model Global Anti-Base Erosion rules under Pillar Two. These rules provide for the taxation of certain large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15 , calculated on a jurisdictional basis. Certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation to implement many aspects of the Pillar Two rules beginning on January 1, 2024, with certain remaining impacts to be effective from January 1, 2025. We do not currently anticipate that Pillar Two legislation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, but we will continue to monitor future legislation and any additional guidance that is issued.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to reporting results according to GAAP, we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance the understanding of our operating performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental metrics that provide greater transparency into our results of operations and can assist both management and investors in understanding and assessing the operational performance of our business on a consistent basis, as it removes the impact of non-cash or non-recurring items from operating results and provides an additional tool to compare our results with other companies in the industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures include adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share" and "free cash flow." 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before deferred revenue fair value adjustment, interest income, interest expense, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization, goodwill impairment, gain on deconsolidation, non cash compensation expense, restructuring charges and transaction costs, merger related costs, Convertible Promissory Note impairment, severance expense, litigation, regulatory and other governance related expenses, foreign currency, non-income tax expense adjustment, fair market value adjustments to investments in private companies, (gain) loss from equity method investments and loss attributable to non controlling interest. 
 
 Adjusted net income represents net income (loss) before income tax provision (benefit), gain (loss) from equity method investments, deferred revenue fair value adjustment, non cash interest expense, cash interest on our Convertible Notes, amortization of acquired intangibles, goodwill impairment, gain on deconsolidation, non cash compensation expense, restructuring charges and transaction costs, merger related costs, Convertible Promissory Note impairment, severance expense, litigation, regulatory and other governance related expenses, foreign currency, non-income tax expense adjustment, fair market value adjustments to investments in private companies and loss attributable to non controlling interest. Reconciling items are presented gross of tax, and a normalized tax rate is applied to the total of all reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net income. The normalized tax rate is based solely on the estimated blended statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We monitor the normalized tax rate based on events or trends that could materially impact the rate, including tax legislation changes and changes in the geographic mix of our operations. 
 
 Adjusted net income per diluted share represents adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders divided by the diluted number of weighted average shares outstanding. For purposes of the adjusted net income per share calculation, we assume all potential shares to be issued in connection with our Convertible Notes are dilutive. 
 
 "Free cash flow" represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internally developed software. 
 
 Our Board and management use these non-GAAP financial measures: 
 
 As measures of operating performance; 
 For planning purposes, including the preparation of annual budgets; 
 To allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; 
 To evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; and 
 In communications with our Board concerning our financial performance. 
 
 Our Compensation Committee, Board and our management may also consider adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, among other factors, when determining management s incentive compensation. 
 
 We also present adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow as supplemental performance measures because we believe that they provide our Board, management and investors with additional information to assess our performance. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share provide comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by changes in interest expense and interest income that are influenced by capital structure decisions and capital market conditions, income tax provision (benefit), variations in the age and book depreciation of fixed assets affecting relative depreciation expense and amortization of internally developed software, amortization of acquired intangible assets, goodwill impairment, gain on deconsolidation, restructuring charges and transaction costs, merger related costs, Convertible Promissory Note impairment, severance expense, litigation, regulatory and other governance related expenses, foreign currency, non-income tax expense adjustment, fair market value adjustments to investments in private companies, (gain) loss from equity method investments and loss attributable to non controlling interest. Our management also believes it is useful to exclude non cash compensation expense from adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share because non cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time. Free cash flow is useful to 

Table of Contents 

analyze cash flows generated from our business and our ability to fund our ongoing operations, debt service obligations and to fund potential acquisitions or other strategic activities. 
 
 We believe adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts use adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share and free cash flow as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall performance of companies, and we anticipate that our investors and analyst presentations will include adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income, operating income, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our profitability or liquidity. 
 
 We understand that, although adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow are frequently used by securities analysts and others in their evaluation of companies, these measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In particular you should consider: 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow do not reflect non cash components of employee compensation; 
 
 Although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 
 
 Due to either net losses before income tax expense or the use of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, net cash paid for income taxes was 13.2 million and 13.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the event that we generate taxable income and our existing net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income taxes have been fully utilized or have expired, income tax payments will be higher; and 
 
 Other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 
 Management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP and adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and free cash flow to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Further, our management also reviews GAAP measures and evaluates individual measures that are not included in some or all of our non GAAP financial measures, such as our level of capital expenditures and interest income, among other measures. 
 
 The following tables set forth reconciliations of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures. See "Footnotes to GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations" below for further detail on adjustments.

Table of Contents 

Footnotes to GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations 
 (1) Deferred revenue fair value adjustment represents the effect of purchase accounting on the fair value of acquired deferred revenue in accordance with ASC 606. 
 (2) For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate computed in accordance with GAAP equaled 238.1 and 234.2 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate computed in accordance with GAAP equaled (4.9) and (33.8) , respectively. 
 (3) As of December 31, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards, before any uncertain tax position reserves, of approximately 64 million and 225 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively, available to reduce future income subject to income taxes. As a result, the amount of actual cash taxes we pay for federal, state and foreign income taxes differs significantly from both the amount calculated in accordance with GAAP using the effective income tax rate and from the income tax effect amount calculated using the normalized effective tax rate. 
 (4) Goodwill impairment represents the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge to goodwill in the Envestnet Data Analytics reporting unit. These charges are infrequent and outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations. We exclude these charges to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. 
 (5) Gain on deconsolidation represents the non-cash gain on the deconsolidation of our non-controlling interest. These gains are infrequent and outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations. We exclude these gains to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. 
 (6) Non-cash compensation expense represents expense related to stock-based awards made to employees and directors. We exclude stock-based compensation because the Company does not view it as reflective of our core operating performance as it is a non-cash expense. 
 (7) Restructuring charges and transaction costs represent third-party costs incurred related to significant, distinct enterprise-wide strategic initiatives such as the closure of certain offices in the United States, acquisition and transaction related expenditures, excluding merger related costs, and system integration costs related to implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning System. These third-party costs are infrequent and outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations. We exclude these costs to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. 
 (8) Merger related costs represents costs incurred related to the Merger Agreement entered into on July 11, 2024 with BCPE Pequod Buyer, Inc., a Delaware corporation and BCPE Pequod Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. These costs are outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations. We exclude these costs to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. 
 (9) Due to a change in circumstance for the Convertible Promissory Note customer, the estimated recoverable value of the loan was reassessed during the third quarter of 2024, which resulted in the recognition of non-cash impairment charge. This charge was outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations and excluded to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. 
 (10) Severance expense represents severance and related costs associated with certain strategic initiatives that have reshaped our workforce such as an organizational realignment in the fourth quarter of 2022, post-acquisition integration activity and a reduction in force initiative in 2023. These are not reflective of future ongoing operations and affect comparability of the Company s operational results across reporting periods. 
 (11) Litigation, regulatory and other governance related expenses represent certain third-party non-recurring litigation fees primarily related to litigation matters discussed in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies as well as governance related expenses associated with activist shareholder activity. The litigation costs relate to two matters over a three-year time period and are not reoccurring expenditures. 
 (12) Foreign currency represents gains and losses from foreign currency denominated transactions and the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated balance sheet accounts. These adjustments can vary significantly from period to period and are not indicative of our core operating performance. 
 (13) Non-income tax expense adjustments relate to the remediation of historical sales and use tax issues and are not indicative of our core operating performance. 
 (14) Fair market value adjustments to investments in private companies represents non-recurring unrealized gains and losses related to the Company s investments. These adjustments are infrequent and outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations. 
 (15) Gain (loss) from equity method investments represents gains and losses related to our equity method investments. These investments are not part of our core business and the ventures associated with these investments generally are start-up or early-stage businesses where we have limited influence over their operational and financial policies. The results of operations for each of these investments can vary significantly from period to period and do not represent the Company s ongoing operations. 
 (16) Loss attributable to non-controlling interest represents the loss attributable to the Company s minority economic interest in a private company excluding the impact of non-cash or non-recurring items included within other line items. Before April 1, 2024, the Company consolidated its minority interest in a private company as a result of its ability to control this private company interest through majority representation on the board, the Company has excluded loss attributable to non-controlling interest as it owns a minority economic interest in the private company. This private company is a start-up business and the results of its operations vary significantly from period to period and are not representative of the Company s financial performance. Effective April 1, 2024, the Company no longer had majority representation of the company's board and therefore no longer had a controlling financial interest in this private company which resulted in the deconsolidation of this private company's assets, liabilities and results of operations starting April 1, 2024. 
 (17) Non-cash interest expense represents third-party costs incurred in securing debt and are amortized over the term of the debt. We exclude non-cash interest expense because the Company does not view this expense as reflective of our core operating performance as it is a non-cash expense. 
 (18) For purposes of computing adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, the Company always assumes the convertible notes to be fully converted for all periods presented. Therefore, cash interest for convertible notes is added to adjusted net income in accordance with the if-converted method. 
 (19) Amortization of acquired intangibles represents non-cash amortization expense from intangible assets acquired through acquisitions. The fair value of these acquired intangible assets are estimates and the Company does not view it as reflective of our core operating performance as it is a non-cash expense. 
 (20) Income tax effect represents the tax effect of Non-GAAP adjustments as described above and is calculated using an estimated normalized tax rate of 25.5 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include cash provided by operating activities, including fluctuations in working capital, and access to external capital. Our working capital is affected by the timing of payments related to fees receivable, investment manager fees, employee compensation, income tax, our annual Advisor Summit and various other items. Historically the first quarter of the year is our lowest quarter of cash provided by operating activities primarily due to the payment of annual bonuses during the first quarter of the year following the year they were incurred and prepayments made during the first quarter of the year associated with our Advisor Summit which is held during the second quarter of the year. 
 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated in the ongoing operations of our business will be sufficient to fund our current operations, including capital expenditure needs and debt service obligations, over the next twelve months and beyond. If the cash generated in the ongoing operations of our business is insufficient to fund these requirements, we may be required to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility or incur additional debt to fund our ongoing operations or to fund potential acquisitions or other strategic activities. 
 
 We will continue to actively manage our cash balances by making decisions regarding the amounts, timing and manner in which cash is generated and used in order to ensure we are able to meet our cash, capital and liquidity requirements and maintain operations for both the short and long term. 
 
 The Company issued 517.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0.75 Convertible Notes due 2025 in August 2020. As of September 30, 2024, 317.5 million aggregate principal of the Convertible Notes due 2025 remained outstanding. Pursuant to the indenture under which the Convertible Notes due 2025 were issued, the Company was required to remove a restrictive legend on the Convertible Notes due 2025 relating to restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on or before September 9, 2021. Due to a clerical error, the restrictive legend was not removed until June 18, 2022. As a result of its failure to remove the legend on a timely basis, the Company was required to pay certain amounts of additional interest and interest thereon after February 15, 2022. Failure to pay the Additional Interest constituted an event of default under the Indenture. The event of default under the Indenture was cured with the payment of an immaterial amount of Additional Interest, as well as certain penalties, in August 2024. In addition, the event of default under the Indenture resulted in an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility due to a cross-default provision in the Revolving Credit Facility. The resulting event of default was waived by the required lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in August 2024. As a result, any and all existing defaults and events of default that had arisen or may have arisen therefrom were cured and the Company was in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility as of August 9, 2024 and continues to be in compliance as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 In connection with the Merger, on October 2, 2024, subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company gave notice to the Trustees and holders of the Convertible Notes due 2025 and Convertible Notes due 2027 that the Merger constitutes a Fundamental Change and a Make Whole Fundamental Change under each of the indentures under which the Convertible Notes were issued and that the Convertible Notes due 2025 and Convertible Notes due 2027 may be surrendered by the holders for conversion. As a result of this event, the Convertible Notes due 2027 will be reclassified from Debt, net of current portion to Current portion of debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total cash and cash equivalents of 193.4 million, no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and 500.0 million available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to covenant compliance. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table presents a summary of our cash flows: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 186,409 73,766 Net cash used in investing activities (81,675) (125,167) Net cash used in financing activities (2,750) (71,458) Effect of exchange rate on changes on cash and cash equivalents 
 (6) 3,897 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 
 101,978 (118,962) 

Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 112.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase of 72.4 million in cash provided by our business operations and 40.2 million in cash provided due to timing of payments within our working capital accounts. Our working capital is affected by the timing of payments related to several items, including but not limited to, employee incentives, income tax payments and cash collections from our clients. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase of 40.2 million in cash provided within our working capital accounts is primarily related to timing of cash collections from our clients and cash payment timing differences within accounts payable and accrued expenses and prepaid expenses and other assets. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased 43.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in cash used related to an issuance of loan receivable to a private company of 20.0 million, a decrease in capitalization of internally developed software of 14.0 million, a decrease in cash used to purchase property and equipment of 12.3 million, a decrease in cash used to acquire proprietary technology of 7.5 million and a decrease in cash used for investments in private companies of 1.1 million, partially offset by 11.1 million in cash associated with the deconsolidation of our non-controlling interest during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased 68.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to settling the remaining aggregate principal amount of 45.0 million on the Convertible Notes due 2023 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash proceeds from capital contributions received by non-controlling interest of 12.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in cash used for share repurchases of 9.3 million, a decrease in cash paid related to tax withholdings for stock-based compensation of 1.2 million and a decrease in cash used to purchase non-controlling units from third-party shareholders of 1.0 million.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. See "Note 2 Basis of Presentation" to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report for significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting estimates, identified in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report include, but are not limited to, the discussion of estimates used for recognition of revenue, impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets and income taxes. Such accounting policies and estimates require significant judgments and assumptions to be used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 There have been no material changes to our market, foreign currency or interest rate risks as discussed in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, are controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Based on this evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 The information in Part I, Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies, Legal Proceedings is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Investment in our securities involves risk. An investor or potential investor should consider the risks summarized below and under the caption Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report when making investment decisions regarding our securities. Except as set forth below, the risk factors that were disclosed in our Annual Report have not materially changed since the date the Annual Report was filed. 
 
 While the Merger is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could harm our business relationships, financial condition, results of operations and business. 
 
 On July 11, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with BCPE Pequod Buyer, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and BCPE Pequod Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. During the period prior to the closing of the Merger and pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, our business is exposed to certain incremental risks and contractual restrictions that could harm our business relationships, financial condition, results of operations, and business, including: 
 
 the proposed Merger and its announcement could have an adverse effect on our ability to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with our customers and business partners; 
 the diversion of management time and attention, as well as distraction of our key personnel, from the Company s ordinary course of business operations; 
 delays or deferments of certain business decisions by our customers and business partners, who may defer decisions about working with us, move to our competitors, or seek to delay or change existing business relationships with us; 

our inability to solicit other acquisition proposals, pursue alternative business opportunities, to freely issue securities, incur or refinance certain indebtedness, or make certain material capital expenditures without Parent s prior approval; 
 the proposed Merger and the termination fee of 90.65 million that we may be required to pay under certain circumstances if the Merger does not close may negatively impact the structure, pricing and terms proposed by a third party seeking to acquire or merge with the Company or deter such third party from making a competing acquisition proposal; 
 the inability to make strategic changes to our business because the Merger Agreement requires us to use reasonable best efforts to conduct our business in the ordinary course of business and not engage in certain kinds of transactions prior to the completion of the proposed Merger without Parent s approval; 
 negative publicity as a result of significant delays in completing the Merger or the failure to complete the Merger, which, in turn, could negatively affect our relationships with business partners and could impact investor and consumer confidence in our business; 
 any litigation relating to the Merger and the costs related thereto; and 
 the incurrence of significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger. 
 
 The Merger may not be completed within the intended timeframe, or at all, and the failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock. 
 
 The Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Merger, including the receipt of specified consents and approvals, some of which have not yet been received may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion, or may impose conditions on the completion of the Merger. We cannot assure that all of the conditions in the Merger Agreement will be satisfied or waived on a timely basis or at all. If the conditions in the Merger Agreement are not satisfied or waived on a timely basis or at all, or if Parent failed to obtain financing necessary to complete the proposed transaction, we may be unable to complete the Merger in the timeframe or manner currently anticipated or at all. 
 
 If the Merger is delayed or not completed, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, we may be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 
 
 the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed; 
 commitments of management s time and resources to the Merger that could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities for the Company; 
 we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, suppliers, business partners or employees; 
 any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including adverse changes in our relationships with customers, suppliers, partners and employees, may continue or intensify in the event the Merger is not consummated or is significantly delayed; 
 the inability to attract and retain key personnel and recruit prospective employees, and the possibility that our current employees could be distracted, and their productivity decline as a result, due to uncertainty regarding the Merger; 
 the inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make changes to our business pending the completion of the Merger, and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business; 
 we have incurred, and expect to continue incurring, significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other Merger-related costs, for which we may receive little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed, and many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the Merger is not completed; and 
 we may be required, if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain limited circumstances, to pay a termination fee of 90.65 million as provided in the Merger Agreement which would require us to use cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes or other uses. 
 
 If any of these or other risks materialize, they could adversely impact our ongoing business, financial condition, financial results and the price of our common stock. Similarly, delays in the completion of the Merger could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the Merger. 

Stockholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of the Merger or otherwise negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Two actions relating to the Merger have been filed against the Company and its Board of Directors. Among other remedies, these claimants are seeking damages and/or to enjoin the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Additional actions relating to the Merger may be filed against the Company and its Board of Directors. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and any such lawsuits could prevent or delay the completion of the Merger and result in significant costs. The litigation costs, including costs associated with the indemnification of obligations to our directors, and diversion of management s attention and resources to address the claims in any litigation related to the Merger may adversely affect our business, results of operations, prospects, and financial condition. Litigation related to the Merger may result in negative publicity or an unfavorable impression of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock, impair our ability to recruit or retain employees, damage our relationships with our customers and business partners, or otherwise harm our operations and financial performance. 
 
 The Merger will involve substantial costs and require substantial management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 
 In connection with the consummation of the Merger, management and financial resources have been diverted and will continue to be diverted towards the completion of the Merger. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur substantial costs and expenses relating to, as well as the direction of management resources towards, the Merger. Such costs, fees and expenses include fees and expenses payable to financial advisors, other professional fees and expenses, fees and costs relating to regulatory filings and filings with the SEC and notices and other transaction-related costs, fees and expenses. We expect these costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results. If the Merger is not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses and expended substantial management resources for which we will have received little or no benefit if the closing of the Merger does not occur. 
 
 In connection with the Merger, our current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us or decide that they do not want to continue their employment. As a result, key employees may depart because of issues relating to such uncertainty or a desire not to remain with the Company following the completion of the Merger. Losses of employees could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Such adverse effects could also be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger for any reason, including delays associated with obtaining requisite regulatory approvals. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 In 2016, the Company announced that our Board had authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 2.0 million shares of its common stock. The timing and volume of share repurchases will be determined by the Company's management based on its ongoing assessments of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common stock and general market conditions. No time limit has been set for the completion of the repurchase program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The repurchase program authorizes the Company to purchase its common stock from time to time in the open market (including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan ), in block transactions, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated stock repurchase programs, through option or other forward transactions or otherwise, all in compliance with applicable laws and other restrictions. 
 
 There were no purchases of equity securities made under the share repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 0.3 million shares are still available to be purchased under this program.
