OVERVIEW We are a publicly traded, self-managed equity REIT that focuses on the ownership, management, and repositioning of high-quality retail and mixed-use properties located primarily in what we believe to be faster growing, business-friendly markets exhibiting accommodative business tax policies, outsized relative job and population growth, and where retail demand exceeds supply. We have pursued our investment strategy by investing primarily through fee simple ownership of our properties, commercial loans and preferred equity . As of September 30, 2024, we own and manage, sometimes utilizing third-party property management companies, 22 commercial real estate properties in seven states in the United States, comprising 4.6 million square feet of gross leasable space. In addition to our income property portfolio, as of September 30, 2024, our business included the following: Management Services: A fee-based management business that is engaged in managing PINE as well as: (i) a portfolio of assets pursuant to the Portfolio Management Agreement (hereinafter defined) and (ii) Subsurface Interests (hereinafter defined) pursuant to the Subsurface Management Agreement (hereinafter defined), as further described in Note 5, Management Services Business . Commercial Loans and Investments: A portfolio of four commercial loan investments and two preferred equity investments which are classified as commercial loan investments. Real Estate Operations: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold its remaining mitigation credits. These credits were produced by the Company s formerly owned mitigation bank. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold its portfolio of subsurface mineral interests associated with approximately 352,000 surface acres in 19 counties in the State of Florida Subsurface Interests ), as further described in Note 6, Real Estate Operations . As part of the Subsurface Interests sale, the Company entered into a management agreement with the buyer to provide ongoing management services (the Subsurface Management Agreement ). Investment in PINE: Our business also includes our investment in PINE. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our investment totaled 43.0 million, or 15.3 of PINE s outstanding equity, including the units of limited partnership interest OP Units we hold in Alpine Income Property OP, LP (the PINE Operating Partnership ), which are redeemable for cash, based upon the value of an equivalent number of shares of PINE common stock at the time of the redemption, or shares of PINE common stock on a one-for-one basis, at PINE s election. Our investment in PINE generates investment income through the dividends distributed by PINE. In addition to the dividends we receive from PINE, our investment in PINE may benefit from any appreciation in PINE s stock price, although no assurances can be provided that 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 such appreciation will occur, the amount by which our investment will increase in value, or the timing thereof. Any dividends received from PINE are included in investment and other income (loss) on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Our strategy for investing in income-producing properties is focused on factors including, but not limited to, long-term real estate fundamentals and target markets, including markets we believe to be faster growing, business-friendly markets exhibiting accommodative business tax policies, outsized relative job and population growth. We employ a methodology for evaluating targeted investments in income-producing properties which includes an evaluation of: (i) the attributes of the real estate (e.g. location, market demographics, comparable properties in the market, etc.); (ii) an evaluation of the existing tenant(s) (e.g. creditworthiness, property level sales, tenant rent levels compared to the market, etc.); (iii) other market-specific conditions (e.g. tenant industry, job and population growth in the market, local economy, etc.); and (iv) considerations relating to the Company s business and strategy (e.g. strategic fit of the asset type, property management needs, ability to use a Section 1031 like-kind exchange structure, etc.). We believe investment in income-producing assets provides attractive opportunities for generally stable cash flows and increased returns over the long run through potential capital appreciation. Our focus on acquiring income-producing investments includes a continual review of our existing income property portfolio to identify opportunities to recycle our capital through the sale of income properties based on, among other possible factors, the current or expected performance of the property and favorable market conditions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold two income properties for an aggregate sales price of 38.0 million and aggregate gains on sale of 3.8 million. As a result of entering into the Exclusivity and Right of First Offer Agreement with PINE (the ROFO Agreement which generally prevents us from investing in single-tenant net lease income properties, our income property investment strategy is focused on multi-tenant, primarily retail-oriented, properties. We may pursue this strategy by monetizing certain of our single-tenant properties, and should we do so, we would seek to utilize the 1031 like-kind exchange structure to preserve the tax-deferred gain on the original transaction(s) that pertains to the replacement asset . Our current portfolio of 16 multi-tenant properties generates 85.8 million of revenue from annualized straight-line base lease payments and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 5.0 years as of September 30, 2024. Our current portfolio of 6 single-tenant income properties generates 5.6 million of revenues from annualized straight-line base lease payments and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 5.5 years as of September 30, 2024.

The 9.5 million increase in total revenue is primarily attributable to increased income produced by the Company s recent income property acquisitions versus that of properties disposed of by the Company during the comparative period as well as more same store revenue from our properties owned during each period. Additionally, revenues from our commercial loans and investments increased as a result of the growth in the commercial loan and investment portfolio.

The increase in revenues of 8.6 million, or 12.3 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to the overall growth and lease up of the Company s income property portfolio, as well as the timing of acquisitions versus dispositions. The increase in operating income of 6.9 million from our income property operations reflects increased rent revenues related to net investments as well as leasing activity. Management Services Revenue from our management services from PINE totaled 3.1 million and 3.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which decrease is due to the decrease in PINE s total equity .

Commercial Loans and Investments Interest income from our commercial loans and investments totaled 4.4 million and 3.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily due to increased income as a result of the timing of investments made related to new loan originations and structured investments during the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by a reduction in interest income attributable to the repayment of one loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Real Estate Operations During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, operating income from real estate operations was 0.5 million and 1.7 million on revenues totaling 2.0 million and 2.6 million, respectively.

 stock price resulted in unrealized non-cash gains (losses) on the Company s investment in PINE in the amount of 3.1 million and (6.0) million which is included in investment and other income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company earned dividend income from the investment in PINE of 1.9 million during each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company derecognized a contingent obligation through a 2.3 million increase in investment and other income (loss) during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, pursuant to a lease amendment whereby the Company s obligation to fund certain tenant improvements was eliminated. The liability was previously included in Accrued and Other Liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled 16.8 million and 16.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 0.6 million is primarily related to increases in the Company s fixed rates on the 2026 Term Loan and the 2027 Term Loan due to swaps effective on March 29, 2024, which was partially offset by a 0.4 million reduction in interest on the Credit Facility due to a lower average outstanding balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to the Company Net income (loss) attributable to the Company totaled 13.3 million and (1.5) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 14.8 million increase in net income is attributable to the factors described above, most notably the 6.5 million increase in investment and other income, as well as an increase in operating income from our income property portfolio as described above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents totaled 8.2 million at September 30, 2024, while restricted cash totaled 1.7 million, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under the heading Restricted Cash for the Company s disclosure related to its restricted cash balance at September 30, 2024. Our cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 45.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 39.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 5.9 million. The primary reason for the increase is the increased cash flows provided by income properties, which is the result of the overall growth and lease up of the Company s income property portfolio, as well as increased cash flows from our commercial loans and investments. Our cash flows used in investing activities totaled 215.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 98.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, for an increase in cash outflows of 117.0 million. The increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily the result of an increase in acquisition activity of income properties and commercial loans and investments, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from dispositions, for an increase in net cash used of 121.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Our cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 161.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in cash inflows of 94.8 million. The increase is primarily due to a 132.3 million increase in proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances under the respective ATM programs, proceeds from preferred equity issuances of 33.0 million, partially offset by a 70.3 million decrease in cash inflows provided by net debt activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 . Long-Term Debt. At September 30, 2024, the current commitment level under the Credit Facility was 300.0 million. The undrawn commitment under the Credit Facility totaled 205.0 million.

The Company s guidance for 2024 investments in income-producing properties, including structured investments, ranges from 300.0 million to 350.0 million. We e xpect to fund future acquisitions utilizing cash on hand, cash from operations, proceeds from the dispositions of income properties through 1031 like-kind exchanges, borrowings on our Credit Facility, if available, and additional financing sources. We expect dispositions of income properties will qualify under the like-kind exchange deferred-tax structure. Dispositions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold two income properties for an aggregate sales price of 38.0 million and aggregate gains on sales of 3.8 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold three income properties for an aggregate sales price of 22.9 million and aggregate gains on sales of 3.3 million. ATM Program .

As of September 30, 2024 Total Commitment (1) 22,414 Less Amount Funded (2,947) Remaining Commitment 19,467 

 (1) Commitment includes tenant improvements, leasing commissions, rebranding, facility expansion and other capital improvements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements . None. Other Matters. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital requirements, maintenance, and debt service requirements over the next twelve months and into the foreseeable future, with cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, 3.6 million of availability remaining under the 2022 ATM Program, and 205.0 million undrawn commitment under the existing 300.0 million Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. Our Board and management consistently review the allocation of capital with the goal of providing the best long-term return for our stockholders. These reviews consider various alternatives, including increasing or decreasing regular dividends, repurchasing the Company s securities, and retaining funds for reinvestment. Annually, the Board reviews our business plan and corporate strategies, and makes adjustments as circumstances warrant. Management s focus is to continue our strategy to diversify our portfolio by redeploying proceeds from like-kind exchange transactions and utilizing our Credit Facility to increase our portfolio of income-producing properties, providing stabilized cash flows with strong risk-adjusted returns primarily in larger metropolitan areas and growth markets. We believe that we currently have a reasonable level of leverage. Our strategy is to utilize leverage, when appropriate and necessary, and proceeds from sales of income properties and the disposition or payoffs on our commercial loans and investments to acquire income properties. We may also acquire or originate commercial loans and investments, invest in

 securities of real estate companies, or make other shorter-term investments. Our targeted investment classes may include the following: Multi-tenant, primarily retail-oriented, properties in major metropolitan areas and growth markets, typically stabilized; Single-tenant retail or other commercial, double or triple net leased, properties in major metropolitan areas and growth markets that are compliant with our commitments under the PINE ROFO Agreement; Ground leases, whether purchased or originated by the Company, that are compliant with our commitments under the ROFO Agreement; Self-developed retail or other commercial properties; Commercial loans and investments, whether purchased or originated by the Company, with loan terms of 1-10 years with strong risk-adjusted yields secured by property types to include hotel, retail, residential, land and industrial; Select regional area investments using Company market knowledge and expertise to earn strong risk-adjusted yields; and Real estate-related investment securities, including commercial mortgage-backed securities, preferred or common stock, and corporate bonds. Our investments in income-producing properties are typically subject to long-term leases. For multi-tenant properties, each tenant typically pays its proportionate share of the aforementioned operating expenses of the property, although for such properties we typically incur additional costs for property management services. Single-tenant leases are typically in the form of triple or double net leases and ground leases. Triple-net leases generally require the tenant to pay property operating expenses such as real estate taxes, insurance, assessments and other governmental fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and capital expenditures.

 Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures Our reported results are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We also disclose Funds From Operations FFO ), Core Funds From Operations Core FFO ), and Adjusted Funds From Operations AFFO ), each of which are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or cash flows from operating activities as reported on our statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, U.S. GAAP financial measures. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as U.S. GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude real estate related depreciation and amortization, as well as extraordinary items (as defined by U.S. GAAP) such as net gain or loss from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets and impairments associated with the implementation of current expected credit losses on commercial loans and investments at the time of origination, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. The Company also excludes the gains or losses from sales of assets incidental to the primary business of the REIT which specifically include the sales of mitigation credits, subsurface sales, investment securities, and land sales, in addition to the mark-to-market of the Company s investment securities and interest related to the 2025 Convertible Senior Notes, if the effect is dilutive. To derive Core FFO, we modify the NAREIT computation of FFO to include other adjustments to U.S. GAAP net income related to gains and losses recognized on the extinguishment of debt, amortization of above- and below-market lease related intangibles, and other unforecastable market- or transaction-driven non-cash items, as well as adding back the interest related to the 2025 Convertible Senior Notes, if the effect is dilutive. To derive AFFO, we further modify the NAREIT computation of FFO and Core FFO to include other adjustments to U.S. GAAP net income related to non-cash revenues and expenses such as straight-line rental revenue, non-cash compensation, and other non-cash amortization. Such items may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on operating cash flows or long-term operating performance. We use AFFO as one measure of our performance when we formulate corporate goals. FFO is used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains or losses on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that Core FFO and AFFO are additional useful supplemental measures for investors to consider because they will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues or expenses. FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates include those estimates made in accordance with U.S. GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. Our most significant estimate is as follows: Purchase Accounting for Acquisitions of Real Estate Subject to a Lease . As required by U.S. GAAP, the fair value of the real estate acquired with in-place leases is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of leasing costs, based in each case on their relative fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value. The assumptions underlying the allocation of relative fair values are based on market information including, but not limited to: (i) the estimate of replacement cost of improvements under the cost approach, (ii) the estimate of land values based on comparable sales under the sales comparison approach, and (iii) the estimate of future benefits determined by either a reasonable rate of return over a single year s net cash flow, or a forecast of net cash flows projected over a reasonable investment horizon under the income capitalization approach. The underlying assumptions are subject to uncertainty and thus any changes to the allocation of fair value to each of the various line items within the Company s consolidated balance sheets could have an impact on the Company s financial condition as well as results of operations due to resulting changes in depreciation and amortization as a result of the fair value allocation. The acquisitions of real estate subject to this estimate totaled four multi-tenant income properties, one vacant land parcel within an existing multi-tenant property, and one building within an existing multi-tenant income property for an aggregate purchase price of 210.0 million, or a total acquisition cost of 207.8 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and four buildings within an existing multi-tenant income property, one multi-tenant property, and one vacant land parcel adjacent to an existing multi-tenant property for an aggregate purchase price of 80.0 million, or a total acquisition cost of 80.3 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , for further discussion of the Company s accounting estimates and policies.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal market risk (i.e. the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices), to which we are exposed is interest rate risk relating to our debt. We may utilize overnight sweep accounts and short-term investments as a means to minimize the interest rate risk. We do not believe that interest rate risk related to cash equivalents and short-term investments, if any, is material due to the nature of the investments. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk relating to our own debt in connection with our Credit Facility, as this facility carries a variable rate of interest. Our borrowings on our 300.0 million Credit Facility bear interest at a rate ranging from SOFR plus 0.10 plus 125 basis points to SOFR plus 0.10 plus 220 basis points based on our level of borrowing as a percentage of our total asset value. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance on our Credit Facility totaled 95.0 million of which 45.0 million was not fixed by virtue of an interest rate swap agreement. As of September 30, 2023, the outstanding balance on our Credit Facility was 216.0 million of which 116.0 million was not fixed by virtue of an interest rate swap agreement. A hypothetical change in the interest rate of 100 basis points (i.e., 1 would affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows by 0.5 million and 1.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from fluctuating interest rates related to certain of its debt borrowings, see Note 16, Interest Rate Swaps in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. By virtue of fixing the variable rate on certain debt borrowings, our exposure to changes in interest rates is minimal but for the impact on other comprehensive income and loss. Management s objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to manage our overall borrowing costs. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation, as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, the Company may be a party to certain legal proceedings, incidental to the normal course of its business. While the outcome of the legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS For a discussion of the Company s potential risks and uncertainties, see the information under the heading Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The risks described in the Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those set forth within the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, if at any time any Change in Law makes it unlawful for any Lender to make or continue to maintain any SOFR Rate Loans or to perform its obligations as contemplated hereby related to SOFR Rate Loans, such Lender shall promptly give written notice thereof to the Borrower and such Lender s obligations to make or maintain SOFR Rate Loans under this Agreement shall be suspended until it is no longer unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain SOFR Rate Loans. The Borrower shall promptly prepay the outstanding principal amount of any such affected SOFR Rate Loans, together with all interest accrued thereon and all other amounts then due and payable to such Lender under this Agreement or, subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, convert such affected SOFR Rate Loans into Base Rate Loans; provided, however, subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement (unless the affected SOFR Rate Loans are converted into Base Rate Loans), the Borrower may then elect to borrow the principal amount of the affected SOFR Rate Loans from such Lender by means of Base Rate Loans from such Lender, which Base Rate Loans shall not be made ratably by the Lenders but only from such affected Lender. 
 Section 10.2. Temporary Inability to Determine Rates; Alternate Rate of Interest . If (A) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR or Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be determined 

 -75- 

pursuant to the definition thereof or (B) the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a SOFR Rate Loan or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR or Adjusted Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, and the Required Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, in each case of (A) and (B) with respect to a Term SOFR Rate Loan, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, (i) any obligation of the Lenders to make or continue the applicable SOFR Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to SOFR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice and (ii) if such determination affects the calculation of the Base Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of any applicable SOFR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Rate Loans or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Rate Loans will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period, in respect of Term SOFR Rate Loans, or immediately in respect of Daily Simple SOFR Rate Loans. Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 1.11. If the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the interest rate on Base Rate Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of Base Rate until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination. The Administrative Agent shall promptly revoke any such determination promptly upon the circumstances leading to such determination ceasing to exist. Section 10.3.

 (i) subject any Lender (or its Lending Office) to any Tax (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
 (ii) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (or its Lending Office) or on the interbank market any other condition affecting its SOFR Rate Loans, it Notes or its obligations to make SOFR Rate Loans; 

 -76- 

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender (or its Lending Office) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its Lending Office) or under any other Loan Document with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction. (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
 (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender s etting forth the a mount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower, s hall be conclusive absent manifest error . The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 
 (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
 Section 10.4. Lending Offices . Each Lender may, at its option, elect to make its Loans hereunder at the branch, office or affiliate specified on the appropriate signature page hereof (each a Lending Office for each type of Loan available hereunder or at such other of its branches, offices or affiliates as it may from time to time elect and designate in a written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. To the extent reasonably possible, a Lender shall designate an alternative branch or funding office with respect to its SOFR Rate Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender under Section 10.3 hereof or to avoid the unavailability of SOFR Rate Loans under Section 10.2 hereof, so long as such designation is not otherwise disadvantageous to the Lender. 
 Section 10.5. Discretion of Lender as to Manner of Funding . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all 

 -77- 

or any part of its Loans in any manner it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations hereunder with respect to Term SOFR Rate Loans shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained each Term SOFR Rate Loan through the purchase of deposits in the applicable interbank market having a maturity corresponding to such Loan s Interest Period, and bearing an interest rate equal to Term SOFR for any applicable Interest Period. Section 10.6. Permanent Inability to Determine Rate; Benchmark Replacement . 
 (a) Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. No replacement of the then-current Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 10.6 will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date 
 (b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
 (c) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations.

 (d) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if any then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the administrator of such Benchmark or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is 

 -78- 

not or will not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable, non-representative, non-compliant or non-aligned tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 
 (e) Benchmark Unavailability Period.

 Section 11.4. Reliance by Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, communication, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower or Guarantors), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
 Section 11.5. Delegation of Duties . The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Section shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Loans as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 
 Section 11.6. Resignation of Administrative Agent; Removal of Administrative Agent . (a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. The Required Lenders may remove the Administrative Agent from its capacity as Administrative Agent in the event of the Administrative Agent s willful misconduct or gross negligence. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States of America, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in 

 -81- 

the United States of America. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation or after removal by the Required Lenders (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date ), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation or removal shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. (b) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date, (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (ii) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. If on the Resignation Effective Date no successor has been appointed and accepted such appointment, the Administrative Agent s rights in the Collateral Documents shall be assigned without representation, recourse or warranty to the Lenders as their interests may appear. Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring Administrative Agent), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Section 11 and Section 12.15 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. 
 Section 11.7. Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders . Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Each Lender represents and warrants that (i) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a commercial lending facility, (ii) in participating as a Lender, it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and in providing other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender, in each case in the ordinary course of business, and not for the purpose of investing in the general performance or operations of the Borrower, or for the purpose of purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument such as a security (and each Lender agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing, such as a claim under the federal or state securities 

 -82- 

laws), (iii) it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Arranger, any Syndication Agent, any documentation agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to make, acquire or hold Loans hereunder and (iv) it is sophisticated with respect to decisions to make, acquire and/or hold commercial loans and to provide other facilities set forth herein, as may be applicable to such Lender, and either it, or the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make, acquire and/or hold such commercial loans or to provide such other facilities, is experienced in making, acquiring or holding such commercial loans or providing such other facilities. Upon a Lender s written request, the Administrative Agent agrees to forward to such Lender, when complete, copies of any field audit, examination, or appraisal report prepared by or for the Administrative Agent with respect to the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary or the Collateral (herein, Reports ). Each Lender hereby agrees that (a) it has requested a copy of each Report prepared by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent; (b) the Administrative Agent (i) makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the completeness or accuracy of any Report or any of the information contained therein or any inaccuracy or omission contained in or relating to a Report and (ii) shall not be liable for any information contained in any Report; (c) the Reports are not comprehensive audits or examinations, and that any Person performing any field examination will inspect only specific information regarding the Borrower and the other Material Subsidiaries and will rely significantly upon the books and records of the Borrower and the other Material Subsidiaries, as well as on representations of personnel of the Borrower and the other Material Subsidiaries, and that the Administrative Agent undertakes no obligation to update, correct or supplement the Reports; (d) it will keep all Reports confidential and strictly for its internal use, not share the Report with any other Person except as otherwise permitted pursuant to this Agreement; and (e) without limiting the generality of any other indemnification provision contained in this Agreement, it will pay and protect, and indemnify, defend, and hold the Administrative Agent and any such other Person preparing a Report harmless from and against, the claims, actions, proceedings, damages, costs, expenses, and other amounts (including reasonable attorney fees) incurred by as the direct or indirect result of any third parties who might obtain all or part of any Report through the indemnifying Lender. Section 11.8. Reserved. 
 Section 11.9. Hedging Liability and Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability. By virtue of a Lender s execution of this Agreement or an assignment agreement pursuant to Section 12.10, as the case may be, any Affiliate of such Lender (including any Hedging Counterparty) with whom the Borrower or any other Material Subsidiary has entered into an agreement creating Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability shall be deemed a Lender party hereto for purposes of any reference in a Loan Document to the parties for whom the Administrative Agent is acting, it being understood and agreed that the rights and benefits of such Affiliate under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Affiliate s right to share in payments and collections out of the Guaranties as more fully set forth in Section 3.1. In connection with any such distribution of payments and collections, or any request for the release of the Guaranties and the Administrative Agent s Liens in connection with the termination of the Commitments, and the payment in full of the Obligations, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due to any Lender or its Affiliate with respect to Hedging 

 -83- 

Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability unless such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent in writing of the amount of any such liability owed to it or its Affiliate prior to such distribution or payment or release of Guaranties and Liens. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each such Affiliate shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be deemed to have agreed to the provisions of Section 3.1(c) and (ii) no such Affiliate shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 11.9 to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Lender or Affiliate. For the avoidance of doubt, all references in this Section 11.9 to any Lender or Affiliate of a Lender shall include or be deemed to include each Hedging Counterparty, even if such Hedging Counterparty or any Person affiliated with such Hedging Counterparty shall cease to be a Lender hereunder, such that any such Hedging Counterparty shall continue to be entitled to all of the rights and benefits otherwise afforded to such Hedging Counterparty hereunder (including without limitation the Guaranties provided under Section 13). Section 11.10. Designation of Additional Agents . The Administrative Agent shall have the continuing right, for purposes hereof, at any time and from time to time to designate, with the consent of the Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, one or more of the Lenders (and/or its or their Affiliates) as syndication agents, documentation agents, book runners, lead arrangers, arrangers, sustainability structuring agents, or other designations for purposes hereto, but such designation shall have no substantive effect, and such Lenders and their Affiliates shall have no additional powers, duties or responsibilities as a result thereof. 
 Section 11.11. [Intentionally Omitted] . 
 Section 11.12. Authorization to Release Guaranties. The Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each of the Lenders and their Affiliates to release any Material Subsidiary from its obligations as a Guarantor if such Person ceases to be a Material Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents. Upon the Administrative Agent s request, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent s authority to release any Material Subsidiary from its obligations as a Guarantor under the Loan Documents. 
 Section 11.13. Authorization of Administrative Agent to File Proofs of Claim . In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower or any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 
 (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and 

 -84- 

to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents including, but not limited to, Sections 1.2, 10.3, 1.11, and 12.15) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 
 (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 
 and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.1 and 12.15. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding. SECTION 12. Miscellaneous . 
 Section 12.1. Withholding Taxes . (a) Payments Free of Withholding . Except as otherwise required by law and subject to Section 12.1(b) hereof, each payment by the Borrower and the Guarantors under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be made without withholding for or on account of any present or future Indemnified Taxes. If any such withholding is so required, the Borrower or such Guarantor shall make the withholding, pay the amount withheld to the appropriate governmental authority before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon, and forthwith pay such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by each Lender and the Administrative Agent free and clear of such taxes (including such taxes on such additional amount) is equal to the amount which that Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) would have received had such withholding not been made. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender pays any amount in respect of any such taxes, penalties or interest, the Borrower or such Guarantor shall reimburse the Administrative Agent or such Lender for that payment on demand in the currency in which such payment was made. 
 (b) U.S. Withholding Tax Exemptions . Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date the initial Borrowing is made hereunder or, if later, the date such financial institution becomes a Lender hereunder, two duly completed and signed copies of (i) either Form W-8 BEN-E (relating to such Lender and entitling it to a complete exemption from withholding under the Code on all amounts to be received by such Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Obligations) or Form W-8 ECI (relating to all amounts to be received by such Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Obligations) of the United States Internal Revenue Service or (ii) solely if such Lender is 

 -85- 

claiming exemption from United States withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of portfolio interest , a Form W-8 BEN-E, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, and a certificate representing that such Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a ten (10)-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code). Thereafter and from time to time, each Lender shall submit to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one or the other of such Forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) and such other certificates as may be (i) requested by the Borrower in a written notice, directly or through the Administrative Agent, to such Lender and (ii) required under then-current United States law or regulations to avoid or reduce United States withholding taxes on payments in respect of all amounts to be received by such Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents or the Obligations. Upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each Lender that is a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a certificate to the effect that it is such a United States person. 
 (c) Inability of Lender to Submit Forms . If any Lender determines, as a result of any change in applicable law, regulation or treaty, or in any official application or interpretation thereof, that it is unable to submit to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent any form or certificate that such Lender is obligated to submit pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 12.1 or that such Lender is required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously submitted or any such form or certificate otherwise becomes ineffective or inaccurate, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and Administrative Agent of such fact and the Lender shall to that extent not be obligated to provide any such form or certificate and will be entitled to withdraw or cancel any affected form or certificate, as applicable. 
 (d) Compliance with FATCA . If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (d), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
 (e) Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower or Guarantor has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower or any Guarantor to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s 

 -86- 

failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.11 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (e). 
 (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds . If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund in respect of any taxes as to which indemnification or additional amounts have been paid to it by the Borrower or a Guarantor pursuant to this Section 12.1, it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower or such Guarantor, upon the request of such Lender, agrees to promptly repay the amount paid over with respect to such refund (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Lender in the event such Lender is required to repay such refund to the relevant Governmental Authority. Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of a Lender arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige any Lender to claim any tax refund or to make available its tax returns or disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof or any other confidential information or require any Lender to do anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other refunds, credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled. 
 (g) Evidence of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or a Guarantor to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, the Borrower or such Guarantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
 Section 12.2. No Waiver, Cumulative Remedies. No delay or failure on the part of the Administrative Agent, or any Lender, or on the part of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations, in the exercise of any power or right under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof or as an acquiescence in any default, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. The rights and remedies hereunder of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, and of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which any of them would otherwise have. 
 Section 12.3. Non-Business Days. If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date of such payment shall be extended to the next 

 -87- 

succeeding Business Day on which date such payment shall be due and payable. In the case of any payment of principal falling due on a day which is not a Business Day, interest on such principal amount shall continue to accrue during such extension at the rate per annum then in effect, which accrued amount shall be due and payable on the next scheduled date for the payment of interest. Section 12.4. Documentary Taxes. The Borrower agrees to pay on demand any U.S. documentary, stamp or similar taxes payable in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including interest and penalties, in the event any such taxes are assessed, irrespective of when such assessment is made and whether or not any credit is then in use or available hereunder. 
 Section 12.5. Survival of Representations. All representations and warranties made herein or in any other Loan Document or in certificates given pursuant hereto or thereto shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the date as of which they were made as long as any credit is in use or available hereunder. 
 Section 12.6. Survival of Indemnities. All indemnities and other provisions relative to reimbursement to the Lenders of amounts sufficient to protect the yield of the Lenders with respect to the Loans, including, but not limited to, Sections 1.11, 10.3, and 12.15 hereof, shall (subject to Section 10.3(c) hereof) survive the termination of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the payment of the Obligations. 
 Section 12.7. Sharing of Set-Off. Each Lender agrees with each other Lender a party hereto that if such Lender shall receive and retain any payment, whether by set-off or application of deposit balances or otherwise, on any of the Loans in excess of its ratable share of payments on all such Obligations then outstanding to the Lenders, then such Lender shall purchase for cash at face value, but without recourse, ratably from each of the other Lenders such amount of the Loans held by each such other Lenders (or interest therein) as shall be necessary to cause such Lender to share such excess payment ratably with all the other Lenders; provided, however, that if any such purchase is made by any Lender, and if such excess payment or part thereof is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the related purchases from the other Lenders shall be rescinded ratably and the purchase price restored as to the portion of such excess payment so recovered, but without interest. 
 Section 12.8. Notices. Except as otherwise specified herein, all notices hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be in writing (including, without limitation, notice by telecopy) and shall be given to the relevant party at its address or telecopier number set forth below, or such other address or telecopier number as such party may hereafter specify by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower given by courier, by United States certified or registered mail, by telecopy or by other telecommunication device capable of creating a written record of such notice and its receipt.

 (f) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine. 
 (g) Each party s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 12.30 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof).

 (d) the existence of any claim, set-off, or other rights which the Borrower or other obligor or any other guarantor may have at any time against the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any other Person, whether or not arising in connection herewith; 
 (e) any failure to assert, or any assertion of, any claim or demand or any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights or remedies against the Borrower or other obligor, any other guarantor, or any other Person or Property; 

 -103- 

(f) any application of any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any obligation of the Borrower or other obligor, regardless of what obligations of the Borrower or other obligor remain unpaid; 
 (g) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the Borrower or other obligor or any other guarantor for any reason of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by the Borrower or other obligor or any other guarantor of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount payable under the Loan Documents; or 
 (h) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 13.

Each Guarantor s obligations under this Section 13 shall remain in full force and effect until the Commitments are terminated, and the principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable by the Borrower and the Guarantors under this Agreement and all other Loan Documents have been paid in full. If at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount payable by the Borrower or other obligor or any Guarantor under the Loan Documents is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of the Borrower or other obligor or of any guarantor, or otherwise, each Guarantor s obligations under this Section 13 with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had become due but had not been made at such time. 
 Section 13.4. Subrogation . Each Guarantor agrees it will not exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation by any payment made hereunder, or otherwise, until all the obligations guaranteed hereby shall have been paid in full subsequent to the termination of all the Commitments. If any amount shall be paid to a Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior to the later of (x) the payment in full of the Obligations, Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability and Hedging Liability and all other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder and the other Loan Documents and (y) the termination of the Commitments, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (and their Affiliates) and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders (and their Affiliates) or be credited and applied upon the Obligations, Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability and Hedging Liability, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
 Section 13.5. Waivers . Each Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest, and any notice except as specifically provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any other Person against the Borrower or other obligor, another guarantor, or any other Person. 
 Section 13.6. Limit on Recovery . Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the right of recovery against each Guarantor under this Section 13 shall not exceed 1.00 less than the 

 -104- 

lowest amount which would render such Guarantor s obligations under this Section 13 void or voidable under applicable law, including, without limitation, fraudulent conveyance law. Section 13.7. Stay of Acceleration . If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower or other obligor under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or such obligor, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent made at the request of the Required Lenders. 
 Section 13.8. Benefit to Guarantors .

 Section 13.9. Guarantor Covenants. Each Guarantor shall take such action as the Borrower is required by this Agreement to cause such Guarantor to take, and shall refrain from taking such action as the Borrower is required by this Agreement to prohibit such Guarantor from taking. 
 Section 13.10. Keepwell . Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Guarantor to honor all of its obligations under this Guaranty in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section, or otherwise under this Guaranty, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and effect until discharged in accordance with Section 13.3. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section constitute, and this Section shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of each other Guarantor for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

The aggregate of any payments that would otherwise have been paid before the Specified Employee Payment Date will be paid to the Executive in a lump sum on the Specified Employee Payment Date and thereafter, any remaining payments will be paid without delay in accordance with their original schedule.

To the extent required by Section 409A, each reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided under this Agreement will be provided in accordance with the following: (A) The amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during each fiscal year of the Company cannot affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other fiscal year; (B) Any reimbursement of an eligible expense will be paid to the Executive on or before the last day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the expense was incurred; and (C) Any right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits under this Agreement will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
