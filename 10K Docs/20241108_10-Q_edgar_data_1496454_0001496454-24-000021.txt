The Company has primarily leased its seniors housing properties to wholly-owned TRS entities and engaged independent third-party managers under management agreements to operate the properties under the RIDEA structures; however, the Company has also leased some of its properties to third-party tenants under triple-net or similar lease structures, where the tenant bears all or substantially all of the costs (including cost increases, for real estate taxes, utilities, insurance and ordinary repairs). In addition, most of the Company s investments have been wholly owned, although, it has, to a lesser extent, invested through partnerships with other entities where it was believed to be appropriate and beneficial.

 These fair market values are based on current rates and spreads the Company would expect to obtain for similar borrowings. Since this methodology includes inputs that are less observable by the public and are not necessarily reflected in active markets, the measurement of the estimated fair values related to the Company s mortgage notes payable and credit facilities is categorized as Level 3 on the three-level valuation hierarchy. 
 Generally, the loan agreements for the Company s mortgage loans contain customary financial covenants and ratios; including (but not limited to) the following: debt service coverage ratio, minimum occupancy levels, limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness, etc. The loan agreements also contain customary events of default and remedies for the lenders.

 During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reclassified approximately million and million, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings related to the Company s interest rate caps and during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reclassified approximately million and million, respectively. The net gain or loss reclassified into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is reported in interest expense and loan cost amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The amount that is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings in the next 12 months related to interest rate caps is approximately million. amounts related to the Company s interest rate swaps have been reclassified into earnings during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the Company does t expect any amounts related to interest rate swaps to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. The Company did t have any interest rate swaps in place during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivative financial instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. The Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative financial positions and has determined that such impact is not significant to the overall valuation of its derivative financial instruments. As a result, the Company determined that its derivative financial instruments valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Determining fair value requires management to make certain estimates and judgments. Changes in assumptions could have a positive or negative impact on the estimated fair values of such instruments which could, in turn, impact the Company s results of operations.

 Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
 Statements contained under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that are not statements of historical or current fact may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbor created by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements are statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, but reflect management s current understandings, intentions, beliefs, plans, expectations, assumptions and/or predictions regarding the future of the Company s business and its performance, the economy, and other future conditions and forecasts of future events and circumstances.

The Company s forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. While the Company s management believes its forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. As with any projection or forecast, forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data and/or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise, and may not be realized. The Company s forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations and a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company s ability to control or accurately predict. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, the Company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. 
 Important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions and the following: 
 the duration of recovery to occupancy from the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 a worsening economic environment in the U.S. or globally, including continued or increasing inflation and financial market fluctuations; 
 risks associated with the Company s investment strategy, including its concentration in the seniors housing sector; 
 the illiquidity of an investment in the Company s stock; 
 liquidation at less than the subscription price of the Company s stock; 
 the impact of regulations requiring periodic valuation of the Company on a per share basis, including the uncertainties inherent in such valuations and that the amount that a stockholder would ultimately realize upon liquidation may vary significantly from the Company s estimated net asset value; 
 risks associated with real estate markets, including declining real estate values and rising insurance costs; 
 risks associated with reliance on the Company s advisor and its affiliates, including conflicts of interest; 
 the Company s failure to repay, obtain, renew, refinance or extend necessary financing or to access the debt or equity markets; 
 
 disruptions from cybersecurity incidents; 
 
 costs resulting from damaging weather events and climate change; 
 the use of debt to finance the Company s business activities, including repayment, refinancing and interest rate risk and the Company s failure to comply with debt covenants; 
 competition for properties and/or tenants; 
 defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants;

failure to lease properties on favorable terms or at all; 
 the impact of current and future environmental, zoning and other governmental regulations affecting the Company s properties; 
 the impact of changes in accounting rules; 
 inaccuracies of the Company s accounting estimates; 
 unknown liabilities of acquired properties or liabilities caused by property managers or operators; 
 material adverse actions or omissions by any joint venture partners; 
 consequences of the Company s net operating losses; 
 increases in operating costs and other expenses; 
 uninsured losses or losses in excess of the Company s insurance coverage; 
 the impact of outstanding and/or potential litigation; 
 risks associated with the Company s tax structuring; and 
 failure to qualify for and maintain the Company s qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
 Given these uncertainties, the Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information. 
 For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with the Company s business and other important factors that could cause the Company s actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements, please refer to the factors listed and described in the Company s reports filed from time to time with the SEC, including, but not limited to, the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, a copy of which may be obtained from the Company s website at www.cnlhealthcareproperties.com.

 Introduction 
 The following discussion is based on the condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 (unaudited) and December 31, 2023. Amounts as of December 31, 2023 included in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and the notes thereto, as well as the audited consolidated financial statements, notes and management s discussion and analysis included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Overview 
 CNL Healthcare Properties, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We have and intend to continue to be organized and operate in a manner that allows us to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The terms us, we, our, Company and CNL Healthcare Properties include CNL Healthcare Properties, Inc. and each of its subsidiaries. 
 Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all operations are conducted, either directly or indirectly, through: (1) the Operating Partnership in which we are the sole limited partner and our wholly owned subsidiary, CHP GP, LLC, is the sole general partner; (2) a wholly owned TRS, CHP TRS Holding, Inc.; (3) property owner subsidiaries and lender subsidiaries, which are single purpose entities; and (4) investments in joint ventures. 
 15 

We are externally managed and advised by CNL Healthcare Corp. (the Advisor ). Our Advisor has responsibility for our day-to-day operations, serving as our consultant in connection with policy decisions to be made by our board of directors, and for identifying, recommending and executing on Possible Strategic Alternatives (as described below under Possible Strategic Alternatives ), and dispositions on our behalf pursuant to an advisory agreement. For additional information on our Advisor, its affiliates or other related parties, as well as the fees and reimbursements we pay, see Note 6. Related Party Arrangements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our seniors housing investment portfolio consisted of interests in 70 properties, consisting of a geographically diversified portfolio of 69 seniors housing communities and one vacant land parcel in 26 states. The types of seniors housing properties that we own include independent and assisted living facilities, continuing care retirement communities and Alzheimer s/memory care facilities. 
 
 Possible Strategic Alternatives 
 In 2017, we began evaluating possible strategic alternatives to provide liquidity to our stockholders. In April 2018, our board of directors formed a special committee consisting solely of our independent directors Special Committee to consider possible strategic alternatives, including, but not limited to (i) the listing of our or one of our subsidiaries common stock on a national securities exchange; (ii) an orderly disposition of our assets or one or more of our asset classes and the distribution of the net sale proceeds thereof to our stockholders; and (iii) a potential business combination or other transaction with a third-party or parties that provides our stockholders with cash and/or securities of a publicly traded company (collectively, among other options, Possible Strategic Alternatives ). Since 2018, the Special Committee has engaged KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. to act as its financial advisor in connection with exploring our Possible Strategic Alternatives. 
 In connection with our consideration of the Possible Strategic Alternatives, our board of directors suspended both our Reinvestment Plan and our Redemption Plan effective July 11, 2018. In addition, as part of executing on Possible Strategic Alternatives, our board of directors committed to a plan to sell 70 properties, consisting of medical office buildings, post-acute care facilities, acute care hospitals and several skilled nursing facilities across the U.S. The Company completed the sale of the last of the 70 properties in 2022. 
 Our Special Committee continues to work with our financial advisor to carefully study market data. Economic and transactional environments were not conducive for dispositions or any type of large-scale deals in 2023 due to a volatile credit and debt capital markets, along with 11 interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve between March 2022 and July 2023. We remain fully committed to our readiness, active study and pursuit of additional Possible Strategic Alternatives to provide incremental liquidity to our stockholders when constructive market conditions return. 
 
 Seniors Housing Portfolio 
 Our remaining investment focus is in seniors housing communities. We have invested in or developed the following types of seniors housing properties: 
 Independent Living Facilities. Independent living facilities are age-restricted, multi-family rental or ownership (condominium) housing with central dining facilities that provide residents, as part of a monthly fee, meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation, social and recreational activities. 
 Assisted Living Facilities. Assisted living facilities are usually state-regulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities, but also provide, in a majority of the units, supportive care from trained employees to residents who are unable to live independently and require assistance with activities of daily living. The additional services may include assistance with bathing, dressing, eating, and administering medications. 
 Memory Care/Alzheimer s Facilities. Those suffering from the effects of Alzheimer s disease or other forms of memory loss need specialized care. Memory care/Alzheimer s centers provide the specialized care for this population including residential housing and assistance with the activities of daily living. 
 
 Portfolio Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, our healthcare investment portfolio consisted of interests in 70 properties, comprising 69 seniors housing communities and one vacant land parcel. 
 16 

We believe demographic trends and compelling supply and demand indicators present a strong case for an investment focus on seniors housing real estate and real estate-related assets. Our seniors housing investment portfolio is geographically diversified with properties in 26 states. The map below shows our seniors housing investment portfolio across geographic regions as of November 7, 2024: 

The following table summarizes our seniors housing investment portfolio by investment structure as of November 7, 2024:

 (2) Properties that are leased to TRS entities and managed pursuant to third-party management contracts (i.e. RIDEA structure) where we report resident fees and services, and the corresponding property operating expenses. 
 
 Portfolio Evaluation 
 While we are not directly impacted by the performance of the underlying properties leased to third-party tenants, we believe that the financial and operational performance of our tenants provides an indication about the stability of our tenants and their ability to pay rent. To the extent that our tenants, managers or joint venture partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make rent payments to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Our tenants and managers are generally contractually required to provide this information to us in accordance with their respective lease, management and/or joint venture agreements. Therefore, in order to mitigate the aforementioned risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. 
 We monitor the credit of our tenants to stay abreast of any material changes in credit quality. We monitor credit quality by (1) reviewing financial statements that are required to be delivered to us under the applicable lease, (2) direct interaction with onsite property managers, (3) monitoring news and rating agency reports regarding our tenants (or their parent companies) and their underlying businesses, (4) monitoring the timeliness of rent collections and (5) monitoring lease coverage. 
 17 

When evaluating the performance of our seniors housing portfolio, management reviews property-level operating performance versus budgeted expectations, conducts periodic operational review calls with operators and conducts periodic property inspections or site visits. Management also reviews occupancy levels and monthly revenue per occupied unit, which we define as total revenue divided by average number of occupied units. Similarly, when evaluating the performance of our third-party operators, management reviews monthly financial statements, property-level operating performance versus budgeted expectations, conducts periodic operational review calls with operators and conducts periodic property inspections or site visits. All of the aforementioned operating and statistical metrics assist us in determining the ability of our properties or operators to achieve market rental rates, to assess the overall performance of our diversified healthcare portfolio, and to review compliance with leases, debt, licensure, real estate taxes, and other collateral. 
 
 Significant Tenants and Operators 
 Our real estate portfolio of 69 seniors housing properties is operated by a mix of national or regional operators and the following represents the significant tenants and operators that lease or manage 10 or more of our rentable space as of November 7, 2024, excluding the vacant land parcel:

 Operator Expirations 
 As of November 7, 2024, we had 54 seniors housing properties managed by third-party operators. All of our management agreements have been in place for multiple years, and some include annual auto-renewal clauses which are effective unless a notice of termination is provided by either party. We work with our operators in advance of management agreement expirations or renewal period options in order for us to maintain a balanced operator rollover schedule, which provides us flexibility to execute on possible strategic alternatives, minimize potential early termination fees and align with the broader industry. The management agreements of 31 of our managed seniors housing properties are scheduled to expire within one year or less as of September 30, 2024, all of which are expected to be renewed. 
 
 Tenant Lease Expirations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned 15 seniors housing properties that were leased to third party tenants under triple-net operating leases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our rental income represented approximately 7.5 of our total revenues. 
 Under the terms of our triple-net lease agreements, each tenant is responsible for payment of property taxes, general liability insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, including structural and roof expenses. Each tenant is expected to pay real estate taxes directly to the taxing authorities. However, if the tenant does not pay the real estate taxes, we are liable. 
 18 

We work with our tenants in advance of the lease expirations or renewal period options in order for us to maintain a balanced lease rollover schedule and high occupancy levels, as well as to enhance the value of our properties through extended lease terms. Certain amendments or modifications to the terms of existing leases could require lender approval. 
 The following table lists, on an aggregate basis, scheduled expirations for the remainder of 2024, each of the next nine years and thereafter on our consolidated seniors housing portfolio, assuming that none of the tenants exercise any of their renewal options (in thousands, except for number of properties and percentages):

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our ongoing primary source of capital is proceeds from operating cash flows. Our primary uses of capital include the payment of distributions, payment of operating expenses, funding capital improvements to existing properties and payment of debt service. Generally, we expect to meet short-term working capital needs from our cash flows from operations. As necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures or to cover periodic shortfalls between distributions paid and cash flows from operating activities. 
 Weighted average occupancy was higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Rate increases at our properties as part of ongoing resident lease renewals and improved occupancy, resulted in an increase in revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect that increases in occupancy and resident rate increases will continue and will increase revenue streams and NOI margins during the remainder of 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 112.5 million of liquidity (consisting of 50.5 million cash on hand and 62.0 million in undrawn availability under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility). We remain focused on maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility and continue to focus on improving occupancy and implementing market rate increases while we continue to navigate through elevated labor costs and an elevated interest rate environment. The rate of revenue growth, elevated labor costs, volatility in the credit markets and the current interest rate environment have and may continue to impact our sources and uses of capital, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 19 

We have pledged certain of our properties in connection with our borrowings and may continue to strategically leverage our real estate and use debt financing to provide additional funds for the payment of distributions to stockholders, working capital and for other corporate purposes. Our ability to increase our borrowings could be adversely affected by credit market conditions and the current interest rate environment, which could result in lenders reducing or limiting funds available for loans, including loans collateralized by real estate. We may also be negatively impacted by elevated interest rate levels on our unhedged variable rate debt or the timing of when we seek to refinance existing debt. As part of our variable debt hedging strategy, we have purchased interest rate caps and swaps for interest rate protection. We continue to monitor the credit markets and continue to evaluate the need and the timing for additional interest rate protection in the form of interest rate caps or swaps on unhedged variable rate debt or variable rate debt with interest rate protection scheduled to mature. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Borrowings 
 There were no borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we refinanced a mortgage loan with the existing lender that consisted of 16.1 million of indebtedness secured by five properties that had a LIBOR based benchmark rate and was scheduled to mature in February 2024. In connection with the refinancing, we also amended certain terms and transitioned the benchmark rate for the mortgage loan from LIBOR to Term SOFR effective June 30, 2023, extended the maturity date from February 2024 to February 2026 and obtained two one-year extension options. We paid the Advisor a refinance fee of approximately 0.2 million related to this transaction. We may borrow money to fund enhancements to our portfolio, as well as to cover periodic shortfalls between distributions paid and cash flows from operating activities to the extent impacted by elevated labor costs, and an elevated interest rate environment. 
 Maturity of Short-Term Securities 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had invested approximately 24.2 million of available cash in held-to-maturity securities to enhance the yield earned on cash on hand. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received approximately 15.0 million from the maturity of short-term securities and reinvested 4.9 million of these proceeds in short-term securities. All of our investments matured as of December 31, 2023, and we no longer have investments in short-term securities. 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 31.0 million and 24.6 million, respectively. The change in cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily the result of the following: 
 an increase in property NOI, related to our seniors housing properties due to higher average occupancy and rate increases subsequent to September 30, 2023; partially offset by 
 higher interest expense due to an increase in our weighted average interest costs from the refinancing of our 2023 Credit Facilities in December 2023. 
 
 Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We paid approximately 9.2 million and 10.5 million in capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We continue to invest in capital improvements to maintain and improve our properties. 
 Acquisition of Non-Controlling Interest 
 There were no acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we indirectly owned one property through a 95 controlling interest in the Watercrest at Katy Joint Venture, our only subsidiary classified as a VIE. Effective November 1, 2024, we acquired the remaining 5 interest in the subsidiary from our non-controlling interest venture partner for approximately 1.5 million and as a result, own a 100 controlling interest in the Watercrest at Katy Joint Venture. 

20 

Purchase of Interest Rate Cap 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid approximately 3.1 million to purchase a short-term interest rate cap with a notional value of 420.0 million, a strike price of 3.5 , and a maturity date in August 2023, to hedge the majority of our variable rate interest exposure relating to the Credit Facilities. In December 2023, we refinanced our Credit Facilities, entered into the 2023 Credit Facilities and in conjunction therewith, entered into an interest rate swap with respect to our 2023 Credit Facilities that matures in December 2025. In addition, in June 2024, we entered into a short-term interest rate cap to replace an interest rate cap that matured in July 2024 relating to 16 million of variable rate secured indebtedness. We paid approximately 0.1 million for the interest rate cap, with a notional value of 8.0 million, a strike price of 3.0 and a maturity date of January 2025, to hedge a portion of our variable interest rate exposure. We earned 2.6 million and 3.2 million, respectively from the interest swap and interest rate cap counterparties related to variable rate debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These amounts are included in interest expense and loan costs amortization in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Debt Repayments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid approximately 0.7 million in scheduled principal payments on our mortgages and other notes payable. In March 2024, we used cash on hand to pay down approximately 10.0 million of amounts outstanding under our 2023 Revolving Credit Facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid approximately 25.1 million of repayments on our mortgages and other notes payable, which included the repayment of a mortgage loan of approximately 22.8 million collateralized by one property in advance of its scheduled maturity of June 2023, the repayment of 1.4 million of unscheduled principal payments relating to a mortgage loan collateralized by five properties and 0.7 million of scheduled principal payments. 
 The following is a schedule of future principal payments for our total indebtedness for the remainder of 2024, each of the next four years and thereafter, in the aggregate, as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 2024 20,314 2025 308 2026 553,542 2027 2028 Thereafter 574,164 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 112.5 million of liquidity (consisting of 50.5 million cash on hand and 62.0 million available under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility) and were well positioned to manage our near-term debt maturities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 20.3 million of scheduled payments coming due during the remainder of 2024, which includes a mortgage loan of approximately 20.2 million, collateralized by one property, scheduled to mature in November 2024. We expect to borrow approximately 20.0 million under our 2023 Revolving Credit Facility to satisfy the obligation that will mature in mid-November 2024. 
 On an ongoing basis, we monitor our debt maturities, engage in dialogue with third-party lenders about various financing scenarios and analyze our overall portfolio borrowings in advance of scheduled maturity dates of the debt obligations to determine the optimal borrowing strategy. 
 The aggregate amount of long-term financing is not expected to exceed 60 of our gross asset values (as defined in our 2023 Credit Facilities agreement) on an annual basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had aggregate debt leverage ratios of approximately 30.3 and 31.0 , respectively, of the aggregate gross carrying value of our assets. 
 Generally, the loan agreements for our mortgage loans contain customary financial covenants and ratios; including (but not limited to) the following: debt service coverage ratio, minimum occupancy levels, limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness, etc. The loan agreements also contain customary performance criteria and remedies for the lenders. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants related to our mortgage loans. 
 21 

The 2023 Credit Facilities contain affirmative, negative, and financial covenants which are customary for loans of this type, including (but not limited to): (i) maximum leverage, (ii) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, (iii) minimum consolidated net worth, (iv) restrictions on payments of cash distributions except if required by REIT requirements, (v) maximum secured indebtedness, (vi) maximum secured recourse debt, (vii) minimum unsecured interest coverage, (viii) maximum unsecured indebtedness ratio, and (ix) limitations on certain types of investments and with respect to the pool of properties supporting borrowings under the 2023 Credit Facilities, minimum weighted average occupancy, and remaining lease terms, as well as property type, MSA, operator, and asset value concentration limits. The limitations on distributions generally include a limitation on the extent of allowable distributions, which are not to exceed the greater of 70 of adjusted FFO (as defined per the 2023 Credit Facilities) and the minimum amount of distributions required to maintain the Company s REIT status. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants related to its 2023 Credit Facilities. 
 Distributions 
 In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to make distributions, other than capital gain distributions, to our stockholders each year in the amount of at least 90 of our taxable income. We may make distributions in the form of cash or other property, including distributions of our own securities. While we generally expect to pay distributions from cash flows provided by operating activities, we have and may continue to cover periodic shortfalls between distributions paid and cash flows from operating activities with proceeds from other sources; such as from cash flows provided by financing activities, a component of which could include borrowings, whether collateralized by our properties or unsecured, or net sales proceeds from the sale of real estate. 
 The following table presents total cash distributions declared and cash distributions per share on a quarterly basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):

 FOOTNOTES: 
 (1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net loss attributable to common stockholders was approximately 9.5 million and 16.6 million, respectively, while total cash distributions declared were approximately 13.4 million and 13.4 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 100 of cash distributions declared to stockholders were considered to be funded with cash provided by operating activities as calculated on a quarterly basis for GAAP purposes. 
 (2) Cash flows from operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP are not necessarily indicative of the amount of cash available to pay distributions and as such our board of directors uses other measures such as FFO and MFFO in order to evaluate the level of distributions.

Results of Operations 
 Except for the impact of an elevated interest rate environment, we are not aware of other material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from the operation of properties, other than those referred to in the risk factors identified in Part II, Item 1A of this report and the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
 Quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, excluding our vacant land, we owned 69 consolidated operating investment properties, respectively. 
 Investment count as of September 30, Consolidated operating investment types: 2024 2023 Seniors housing leased 15 15 Seniors housing managed 54 54 69 69 
 Rental Income and Related Revenues. Rental income and related revenues were approximately 6.9 million and 20.5 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to approximately 6.7 million and 20.2 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Resident Fees and Services. Resident fees and services income was approximately 85.9 million and 252.2 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to approximately 79.5 million and 234.9 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in revenue during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in average occupancy and increases in rates charged to our residents. 
 Property Operating Expenses. Property operating expenses were approximately 62.6 million and 181.8 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to approximately 59.4 million and 175.7 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Property operating expenses increased during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in average occupancy. 
 General and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses were approximately 1.8 million and 6.3 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to approximately 2.0 million and 6.6 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. General and administrative expenses were comprised primarily of personnel expenses of affiliates of our Advisor, directors and officers insurance, franchise taxes, sales taxes, accounting and legal fees, and board of director fees. 
 Asset Management Fees . We incurred asset management fees of approximately 3.3 million and 10.0 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to approximately 3.5 million and 10.4 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Property Management Fees. We incurred property management fees payable to our third-party property managers of approximately 4.3 million and 12.4 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to approximately 3.9 million and 11.5 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The property management fees are based on a percentage of revenues under the property management agreement and the increase across periods is reflective of the increase in average occupancy and resident fees and service revenue over the same period as described above. 
 Financing Coordination Fees. We did not incur any financing coordination fees for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We incurred financing coordination fees of approximately 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the refinancing of the loan associated with five operating properties. 
 23 

Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately 12.6 million and 37.8 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to approximately 12.5 million and 38.7 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expenses are comprised of depreciation and amortization of the buildings, equipment, land improvements and in-place leases related to our real estate portfolio. The decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to in-place lease intangibles from the January 1, 2022 consolidation of the Windsor Manor assets becoming fully amortized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest and Other Income . Interest and other income was approximately 0.4 million and 0.9 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to approximately 0.5 million and 2.5 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest and other income included approximately 0.1 million and 1.0 million in federal/state governmental grants recognized during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the federal government and some states provided funds to providers of seniors housing communities. We recorded these grant funds as other income in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations as all conditions of the grant had been met. We did not receive or recognize grant funds during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Expense and Loan Cost Amortization . Interest expense and loan cost amortization were approximately 11.5 million and 34.6 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to approximately 10.8 million and 30.7 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in interest expense and loan cost amortization was primarily due to an increase in our weighted average interest costs from the refinancing of our 2023 Credit Facilities in December 2023 and an increase in the amortization of debt issuance cost incurred as part of the refinancing. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we were able to partially mitigate the full impact from the rise in interest rates due to the interest rate protection in place as part of our overall variable debt hedging strategy. 
 
 Net Operating Income 
 We generally expect to meet future cash needs for general and administrative expenses, debt service and distributions from NOI. We define NOI, a non-GAAP measure, as total revenues less the property operating expenses and property management fees from managed properties. We use NOI as a key performance metric for internal monitoring and planning purposes, including the preparation of annual operating budgets and monthly operating reviews, as well as to facilitate analysis of future investment and business decisions. It does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income or loss (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our operating performance or to be an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity. We believe the presentation of this non-GAAP measure is important to the understanding of our operating results for the periods presented because it is an indicator of the return on property investment and provides a method of comparing property performance over time. We aggregate NOI on a same store basis for comparable properties that we have owned during the entirety of all periods presented. The chart below presents a reconciliation of our net income to NOI for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands) and the amount invested in properties as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions): 
 Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, Change September 30, Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net loss (3,155) (5,399) (9,468) (16,563) Adjusted to exclude: General and administrative expenses 1,841 2,015 6,251 6,569 Asset management fees 3,337 3,476 10,011 10,427 Financing coordination fees 163 Depreciation and amortization 12,619 12,471 37,785 38,741 Other expense 11,171 10,256 33,619 28,170 Income tax expense 125 118 363 321 Same Store NOI 25,938 22,937 3,001 13.1 78,561 67,828 10,733 15.8 Invested in operating properties, end of period (in millions) 1,739 1,739 1,739 1,739 
 24 

Overall, our NOI for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 3.0 million and 10.7 million, respectively, as compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. NOI increased primarily due to an increase in average occupancy and increases in rates charged to our residents during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by higher operating expenses. 
 
 Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
 Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, NAREIT promulgated a measure known as funds from operations FFO ), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 
 We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, real estate asset impairment write-downs, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate related assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s policy described above. 
 The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or is requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value of the property. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income or loss. However, FFO and MFFO, as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or loss in its applicability in evaluating operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO. 
 Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses for business combinations from a capitalization/depreciation model) to an expensed-as-incurred model that were put into effect in 2009, and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO, have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, as items that are expensed under GAAP and accounted for as operating expenses. Our management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after acquisition activity ceases. Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the IPA has standardized a measure known as modified funds from operations MFFO which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we acquired our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry. 
 25 

We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: MFFO, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income or loss: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted from a GAAP accrual basis in order to reflect such payments on a cash basis of amounts expected to be received for such lease and rental payments); contingent purchase price consideration adjustments; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income or loss; gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan; and unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income or loss in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. 
 Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA s Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income or loss. These expenses are paid in cash by us. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property. 
 Our management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors. For example, acquisition costs are funded from our subscription proceeds and other financing sources and not from operations. 
 By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management s analysis of the operating performance of the properties. 
 Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different non-listed REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way and as such comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flows available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (or loss) or income (or loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations, as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods. 
 Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to FFO and MFFO for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):

 ______________________________ 
 FOOTNOTES: 
 (1) Under GAAP, rental receipts are allocated to periods using various methodologies. This may result in income or expense recognition that is significantly different than underlying contract terms. By adjusting for these items (from a GAAP accrual basis in order to reflect such payments on a cash basis of amounts expected to be received for such lease and rental payments), MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms and debt investments, providing insight on the contractual cash flows of such lease terms and debt investments, and aligns results with management s analysis of operating performance. 
 (2) Management believes that adjusting for the realized loss on the extinguishment of debt, hedges or other derivatives is appropriate because the adjustments are not reflective of our ongoing operating performance and, as a result, the adjustments better align results with management s analysis of operating performance.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 
 We may be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of the long-term debt we used to acquire properties and other permitted investments, as well as impacts of volatile credit markets and an elevated interest rate environment. Our management objectives related to interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and on operating cash flows. To achieve our objectives, we borrow at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available, and in some cases, with the ability to convert from variable rates to fixed rates. With regard to variable rate financing, we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. 
 The following is a schedule as of September 30, 2024 of our fixed and variable rate debt maturities for the remainder of 2024, and each of the next four years and thereafter (principal maturities only) (in thousands): 
 Expected Maturities 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Fair Value (1) 
 Fixed rate debt 20,239 20,239 20,239 Weighted average interest rate on fixed rate debt 3.25 3.25 Variable rate debt 75 308 553,542 553,925 553,912 Average interest rate on variable rate debt (2) 
 2.36 +Term SOFR 2.36 +Term SOFR 2.36 +Term SOFR 2.36 +Term SOFR 
 ____________ 
 FOOTNOTES: 
 (1) The estimated fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt was determined using discounted cash flows based on market interest rates as of September 30, 2024. We determined market rates through discussions with our existing lenders by pricing our loans with similar terms and current rates and spreads. 
 (2) Term SOFR is defined in the respective debt agreement. 
 Management estimates that a hypothetical one-percentage point increase in variable rates compared to variable rates as of September 30, 2024, disregarding the impact of our interest rate protection in place, would increase interest expense by approximately 5.5 million on an annualized basis based on variable rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024. This sensitivity analysis contains certain simplifying assumptions, and although it gives an indication of our exposure to changes in interest rates, it is not intended to predict future results and actual results will likely vary given that our sensitivity analysis on the effects of changes in SOFR does not factor in a potential change in variable rate debt levels or interest rate protection provided by interest rate caps and swaps. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s debt is comprised of approximately 3.5 in fixed rate debt, approximately 65.3 in variable rate debt with current interest rate protection and approximately 31.2 of unhedged variable rate debt. The remaining unhedged variable rate debt primarily relates to our 2023 Credit Facilities. Overall, we believe longer term fixed rate debt could be beneficial in a rising interest rate or rising inflation rate environment and as such we continue to evaluate the need for additional interest rate protection on our unhedged variable rate debt or variable rate debt with interest rate protection scheduled to mature.
