On April 6, 2022 (the Closing Date ), EWC Master Issuer LLC, a limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, indirect subsidiary of the Company (the Master Issuer ), completed a securitization transaction pursuant to which it issued in aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-1 Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2 (the Class A-2 Notes ). In connection with the issuance of the Class A-2 Notes, the Master Issuer also entered into (i) a revolving financing facility that allows for the issuance of up to in Variable Funding Notes Variable Funding Notes ), and certain letters of credit and (2) an advance funding facility with Bank of America, N.A. BofA ), whereby BofA and any other advance funding provider thereunder would, in certain specified circumstances, make certain debt service advances and collateral protection advances (not to exceed in the aggregate). The Variable Funding Notes were undrawn as of October 5, 2024. Fair Value

We granted and during the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023 , respectively, to certain employees and directors under the 2021 Incentive Plan. The RSUs granted generally vest in three equal installments of on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, subject in all cases to continued employment on the applicable vesting date. The total grant date fair value of the RSUs will be recognized as equity-based compensation expense over the vesting per iod. The weighted average grant date fair values of the RSUs granted during the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 were and , respectively. The weighted average grant date fair values of the RSUs granted during the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023 were and respectively.

and options during the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024, respectively, to certain employees under the 2021 Incentive Plan. The weighted average exercise prices of options granted during the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 were and per share, respectively. We granted and options during the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to certain employees under the 2021 Incentive Plan. The weighted average exercise prices of options granted during the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023 were and per share, respectively. The options granted have a contractual term and will cliff vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject in all cases to continued employment on the applicable vesting date. The weighted average grant date fair values of the options were and for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024, respectively, and and for the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The total grant date fair value of the stock options will be recognized as equity-based compensation expense over the vesting period. As these options were granted with exercise prices 20 higher than the closing price, it was determined that the options contained an implicit market condition. As such, the Company estimated the fair value of the options using a binomial lattice model. 

Expected volatility 

Risk-free rate 

Suboptimal exercise factor 
 
 x 

x 

x 

x 

A description of each of the inputs to the lattice model is as follows: Expected dividend yield - The expected dividend yield is based on our history of not paying regular dividends in the past and our current intention to not pay regular dividends in the foreseeable future. An increase in the expected dividend yield would decrease compensation expense. 

 Expected volatility - This is a measure of the amount by which the price of the equity instrument has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. The expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company as well as that of a group of guideline companies. An increase in expected volatility would increase compensation expense. 

 Risk-free interest rate - This is the U.S. Treasury rate as of the measurement date having a term approximating the contractual term of the award. An increase in the risk-free interest rate would increase compensation expense. 

 Suboptimal exercise factor - The multiple of the exercise price at which an option exercise would be expected to occur. An increase in the suboptimal exercise factor would increase compensation expense.

Accordingly, Management s Discussion and Analysis reflects the impact of those corrections. 
 Overview 
 We are the leading franchisor and operator of out-of-home ("OOH") waxing services in the United States by number of centers and system-wide sales. We delivered over 23 million waxing services in 2023 and over 22 million waxing services in 2022 generating 955 million and 899 million of system-wide sales, respectively, across our highly-franchised network. We have a leading portfolio of centers operating in 1,064 locations across 45 states as of October 5, 2024. Of these locations, 1,059 are franchised centers operated by franchisees and five are corporate-owned centers. 
 The European Wax Center brand is trusted, efficacious and accessible. Our culture is obsessed with our guest experience and we deliver a superior guest experience relative to smaller chains and independent salons. We offer guests high-quality, hygienic waxing services administered by our licensed, EWC-trained estheticians (our wax specialists ), at our accessible and welcoming locations (our centers ). Our technology-enabled guest interface simplifies and streamlines the guest experience with automated appointment scheduling and remote check-in capabilities, ensuring guest visits are convenient, hassle-free, and consistent across our network of centers. Our well-known, pre-paid Wax Pass program makes payment easy and convenient, fostering loyalty and return visits. Our core guests view us as a non-discretionary part of their personal-care and beauty regimens, providing us with a highly predictable and growing recurring revenue model. 
 Our asset-light franchise platform delivers capital-efficient growth, significant cash flow generation, and resilience through economic cycles. Our centers are 99 owned and operated by our franchisees who benefit from superior unit-level economics, with mature centers generating annual cash-on-cash returns of approximately 50 . 
 In partnership with our franchisees, we fiercely protect our points of differentiation that attract new guests, build meaningful relationships and promote lasting retention. We are so confident in our ability to delight that we have always offered all of our guests their first wax free. 
 Hair removal solutions are consistently in demand, given the recurring nature of hair growth. The OOH waxing market is the fastest-growing hair removal solution in the United States, defined by an estimated total addressable market of over 18 billion with annualized growth that is more than double other hair removal alternatives. European Wax Center has become the category-defining brand within this rapidly growing market and became so by professionalizing a highly fragmented sector where service consistency, hygiene, and customer trust were not historically offered. We are approximately six times larger than the next largest waxing-focused competitor by center count and approximately 11 times larger by system-wide sales. Our unmatched scale enables us to drive broader brand awareness, ensures our licensed wax specialists are universally trained at the highest standards and drive consistent financial performance across each center. 
 Under the stewardship of our CEO, David Berg, and the other management team members, we have prioritized building a culture of performance, success, and inclusivity. Additionally, we have intensified our focus on enhancing the guest experience and have invested significantly in our corporate infrastructure and marketing capabilities to continue our track record of sustainable growth. The foundation for our next chapter of growth is firmly in place. 
 
 17 

Growth Strategy and Outlook 
 We plan to grow our business primarily by opening new franchised centers as well as increasing our system-wide sales in existing centers while leveraging our corporate infrastructure to expand our profit margins and generate robust free cash flow. 
 We believe our franchisees track record of successfully opening new centers and consistently generating attractive unit-level economics validates our strategy to expand our footprint and grow our capacity to serve more guests. Our center count grew 11 during both fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022, and has grown each year since 2010. Our thoughtful approach to growth ensures each center is appropriately staffed with the high-quality team and licensed, highly-trained wax specialists that our brand has been known for since our initial opening. We believe that none of our existing markets are fully penetrated, and that we have a significant whitespace opportunity of more than 3,000 locations for our standard center format across the United States. Our centers have a long track record of sustained growth delivering consistent positive same-store sales growth with resilient performance through economic cycles. 
 Our straightforward, asset-light franchise platform and our proven track record of increasing profitability is expected to continue to drive EBITDA margin accretion and free cash flow generation as we expand our national footprint. We have invested in building our scalable support infrastructure, and we continually work to optimize the capabilities and systems in place to drive revenue growth and profitability across our existing and planned franchise centers. 
 
 Key Business Metrics 
 We track the following key business metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Accordingly, we believe that these key business metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. These key business metrics are presented for supplemental information purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies. 
 Number of Centers. Number of centers reflects the number of franchised and corporate-owned centers open at the end of the reporting period. We review the number of new center openings, the number of closed centers and the number of relocations of centers to assess net new center growth, and drivers of trends in system-wide sales, royalty and franchise fee revenue and corporate-owned center sales. 
 System-Wide Sales. System-wide sales represent sales from same day services, retail sales and cash collected from wax passes for all centers in our network, including both franchisee-owned and corporate-owned centers. While we do not record franchised center sales as revenue, our royalty revenue is calculated based on a percentage of franchised center sales, which are 6.0 of sales, net of retail product sales, as defined in the franchise agreement. This measure allows us to better assess changes in our royalty revenue, our overall center performance, the health of our brand and the strength of our market position relative to competitors. Our system-wide sales growth is driven by net new center openings as well as increases in same-store sales. 
 Same-Store Sales. Same-store sales reflect the change in year-over-year sales from services performed and retail sales for the same-store base. We define the same-store base to include those centers open for at least 52 full weeks. If a center is closed for greater than six consecutive days, the center is deemed a closed center and is excluded from the calculation of same-store sales until it has been reopened for a continuous 52 full weeks. This measure highlights the performance of existing centers, while excluding the impact of new center openings and closures. We review same-store sales for corporate-owned centers as well as franchisee-owned centers. Same-store sales growth is driven by increases in the number of transactions and average transaction size. 
 Net New Center Openings. The number of net new center openings reflects centers opened during a particular reporting period for both franchisee-owned and corporate-owned centers, less centers closed during the same period. Opening new centers is an integral part of our growth strategy, and we expect the majority of our future new centers to be franchisee-owned. Before we obtain the certificate of occupancy or report any revenue from new corporate-owned centers, we incur pre-opening costs, such as rent expense, labor expense and other operating expenses. Some of our centers open with an initial start-up period of higher-than-normal marketing and operating expenses, particularly as a percentage of monthly revenue. 
 Average Unit Volume AUV ). AUV consists of the average annual system-wide sales of all centers that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. This measure is calculated by dividing system-wide sales during the applicable period for all centers being measured by the number of centers being measured. AUV allows management to assess our franchisee-owned and corporate-owned center economics. Our AUV growth is primarily driven by increases in services and retail product sales as centers fill their books of reservations, which we refer to as maturation of centers. 
 18 

Wax Pass Utilization. We define Wax Pass utilization as the adoption of our Wax Pass program by guests, measured as a percentage of total transactions conducted using a Wax Pass. Wax Pass utilization allows management to better assess the recurring nature of our business model because it is an indication of the magnitude of transactions by guests who have made a longer-term commitment to our brand by purchasing a Wax Pass.

Significant Factors Impacting Our Financial Results 
 We believe there are several important factors that have impacted, and that we expect will continue to impact, our business and results of operations. These factors include: 
 New Center Openings. We expect that new centers will be a key driver of growth in our future revenue and operating profit results. Opening new centers is an important part of our growth strategy, and we expect the majority of our future new centers will be franchisee-owned. Our results of operations have been and will continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new center openings each period. As centers mature, center revenue and profitability increase significantly. The performance of new centers may vary depending on various factors such as the effective management and cooperation of our franchisee partners, whether the franchise is part of a multi-unit development agreement, the center opening date, the time of year of a particular opening, the number of licensed wax specialists recruited, and the location of the new center, including whether it is located in a new or existing market. Our planned center expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative, financial, and other resources. 
 System-Wide Sales Growth. System-wide sales growth is a key driver of our business. Various factors affect system-wide sales, including: 
 consumer preferences and overall economic trends; 

the recurring, non-discretionary nature of personal-care services and purchases; 

our ability to identify and respond effectively to guest preferences and trends; 

our ability to provide a variety of service offerings that generate new and repeat visits to our centers; 

the guest experience we provide in our centers; 

the availability of experienced wax specialists; 

our ability to source and deliver products accurately and timely; 

changes in service or product pricing, including promotional activities; 

the number of services or items purchased per center visit; 

19 

center closures in response to state or local regulations or health concerns 

Overall Economic Trends. Macroeconomic factors that may affect guest spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include employment rates, the rate of inflation, business conditions, changes in the housing market, the availability of credit, interest rates, tax rates and fuel and energy costs. However, we believe that our core guests see our services as largely non-discretionary in nature. Therefore, we believe that overall economic trends and related changes in consumer behavior have less of an impact on our core guests and business than they may have for other industries subject to fluctuations in discretionary consumer spending. 
 Guest Preferences and Demands. Our ability to maintain our appeal to existing guests and attract new guests depends on our ability to develop and offer a compelling assortment of services responsive to guest preferences and trends. We also believe that OOH waxing is a recurring need that brings guests back for services on a highly recurring basis which is reflected in the predictability of our financial performance over time. Core guests comprise approximately 75 of our system-wide sales, which reflects their ongoing commitment to their personal care routine. 
 Our Ability to Source and Distribute Products Effectively. Our revenue and operating income are affected by our ability to purchase our products and supplies in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. While we believe our vendors have adequate capacity to meet our current and anticipated demand, our level of revenue could be adversely affected in the event we face constraints in our supply chain, including the inability of our vendors to produce sufficient quantities of some products or supplies in a manner that matches market demand from our guests, leading to lost revenue. We depend on two key suppliers to source our Comfort Wax and two key suppliers to source our branded retail products and we are thus exposed to concentration of supplier risk. 
 Our Ability to Recruit and Retain Qualified Licensed Wax Specialists for our Franchised Centers. Our franchisee s ability to operate their centers is largely dependent upon their ability to attract and retain qualified, licensed wax specialists. Our unmatched scale enables us to ensure that we universally train our wax specialists at the highest standards, ensuring that our guests experience consistent level of quality, regardless of the specific center they visit. The combination of consistent service delivery, across our trained base of wax specialists, along with the payment ease and convenience of our well-known, pre-paid Wax Pass program fosters loyalty and return visits across our guest base. Over time, our ability to build and maintain a strong pipeline of licensed wax specialists is important to preserving our current brand position. 
 Seasonality. Our results are subject to seasonality fluctuations in that services are typically in higher demand in periods leading up to holidays and the summer season. The resulting demand trend has historically yielded higher system-wide sales in the second and fourth quarter of our fiscal year. In addition, our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, because of several factors, including the timing of center openings, price increases and promotions, and general economic conditions. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Product Sales: Product sales consist of revenue earned from sales of Comfort Wax, other products consumed in administering our wax services and retail merchandise to franchisees, as well as retail merchandise sold in corporate-owned centers. Revenue on product sales is recognized upon transfer of control. Our product sales revenue comprised 57.2 and 57.2 of our total revenue for the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and 56.9 and 56.7 of our total revenue for the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Royalty Fees: Royalty fees are earned based on a percentage of the franchisees gross sales, net of retail product sales, as defined in the applicable franchise agreement, and recognized in the period the franchisees sales occur. The royalty fee is 6.0 of the franchisees gross sales for such period and is paid weekly. Our royalty fees revenue comprised 24.2 and 24.0 of our total revenue for the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and 24.1 and 24.2 of our total revenue for the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Marketing Fees: Marketing fees are earned based on 3.0 of the franchisees gross sales, net of retail product sales, as defined in the applicable franchise agreement, and recognized in the period the franchisees sales occur. Additionally, the Company charges a fixed monthly fee to franchisees for search engine optimization and search engine marketing services, which is due on a monthly basis and recognized in the period when services are provided. Our marketing fees revenue comprised 13.7 and 13.5 of our total revenue for the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and 13.7 and 13.6 of our total revenue for the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Other Revenue: Other revenue primarily consists of service revenues from our corporate-owned centers and franchise fees, as well as technology fees and training, which together represent 4.9 and 5.3 of our total revenue for the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and 5.3 and 5.5 of our total revenue for the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Service revenues from our corporate-owned centers are recognized at the time services are provided. Amounts collected in advance of the period in which service is rendered are recorded as deferred revenue. Franchise fees are paid upon commencement of the franchise agreement and are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis commencing at contract inception through the end of the franchise license term. Franchise agreements generally have terms of 10 years beginning on the date 
 20 

the center is opened and the initial franchise fees are amortized over a period approximating the term of the agreement. Deferred franchise fees expected to be recognized in periods greater than 12 months from the reporting date are classified as long-term on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Technology fees and training are recognized as the related services are delivered and are not material to the overall business. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue: Cost of revenue primarily consists of the direct costs associated with wholesale product and retail merchandise sold, including distribution and outbound freight costs and inventory obsolescence charges, as well as the cost of materials and labor for services rendered in our corporate-owned centers. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages, benefits and other compensation-related costs, rent, software, and other administrative expenses incurred to support our existing franchise and corporate-owned centers, as well as expenses attributable to growth and development activities. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses are accounting, legal, marketing, operations, and other professional fees. 
 Advertising Expenses: Advertising expenses consist of advertising, public relations, and administrative expenses incurred to increase sales and further enhance the public reputation of the European Wax Center brand. 
 Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of property and equipment and capitalized leasehold improvements, as well as amortization of intangible assets, including franchisee relationships and reacquired area representative rights. Area representative rights represent an agreement with area representatives to sell franchise licenses and provide support to franchisees in a geographic region. From time to time, the Company enters into agreements to reacquire certain area representative rights. 
 Interest Expense, net: Interest expense, net consists of interest on our long-term debt, including amounts outstanding under our revolving financing facility, amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs, gains and losses on debt extinguishment as well as interest income from short-term, highly-liquid investments. 
 Other (Income) Expense: Other (income) expense consists of non-cash gains and losses related to the remeasurement of our tax receivable agreement liability and contractual cash interest paid on our tax receivable agreement liability. 
 Income Tax Expense: We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of EWC Ventures and are taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. Income tax expense includes both current and deferred income tax expense. 
 Noncontrolling Interests: We are the sole managing member of EWC Ventures. Because we manage and operate the business and control the strategic decisions and day-to-day operations of EWC Ventures and also have a substantial financial interest in EWC Ventures, we consolidate the financial results of EWC Ventures, and a portion of our net income (loss) is allocated to the noncontrolling interests to reflect the entitlement of the EWC Ventures Post-IPO Members to a portion of EWC Ventures net income (loss).

Comparison of the Thirteen Weeks Ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Total revenue decreased 0.3 million, or 0.5 , to 55.4 million during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 55.7 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in total revenue was largely due to a decrease in transactions at existing centers. The decrease in revenue was largely offset by 38 net new center openings that became operational during the period from October 1, 2023 through October 5, 2024. 
 Product Sales 
 Product sales decreased 0.2 million, or 0.6 , to 31.7 million during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 31.9 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in product sales was primarily due to a decrease in transactions at existing centers and the removal of a surcharge to franchisees that was put in place during the COVID pandemic to help offset elevated supply chain costs. This decrease in product sales was largely offset by new center openings that became operational during the period from October 1, 2023 to October 5, 2024. 
 Royalty Fees 
 Royalty fees increased 0.1 million, or 0.5 , to 13.4 million during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 13.3 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in royalty fees during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024 was the result of new center openings that became operational during the period from October 1, 2023 to October 5, 2024. 
 Marketing Fees 
 Marketing fees increased 0.1 million, or 0.7 , to 7.6 million during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 7.6 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023. Marketing fees increased as a result of new center openings that became operational during the period from October 1, 2023 to October 5, 2024. 
 23 

Other Revenue 
 Other revenue decreased 0.2 million, or 6.9 , to 2.7 million during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 2.9 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to the sale of a corporate-owned center in the first fiscal quarter of 2024. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue decreased 0.7 million, or 4.6 , to 15.0 million during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 15.7 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to negotiated cost savings. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3.1 million, or 21.6 , to 17.5 million during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 14.4 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense as well as costs associated with a debt offering the Company decided to terminate during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024. 
 The increase in payroll and benefits expense was primarily due to severance expense incurred in connection with the departure of our chief executive and commercial officers and the Company s return-to-office mandate as well as increased headcount in our corporate office to support the Company s growth. These increases in payroll and benefits expense were partially offset by the reversal of equity-based compensation expense due to forfeited awards as well as a decline in incentive compensation expense during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024. 
 Advertising 
 Advertising expenses increased 0.3 million, or 3.8 , to 8.4 million during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 8.1 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in advertising expense was attributable to marketing initiatives designed to drive more center traffic as well as the timing of expenses associated with seasonal marketing campaigns. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization for the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024 was largely consistent with the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023, decreasing 62 thousand, or 1.2 , to 5.1 million for the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense, net decreased 0.1 million, or 2.0 , to 6.3 million during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 6.5 million for the 13 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest income from the Company s short-term investments during the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 We recorded 0.8 million and 1.8 million of income tax expense for the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Income tax expense recognized in the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2024 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of non-taxable income attributable to noncontrolling interest, state taxes and the tax effects of stock compensation. Income tax expense recognized in the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of non-taxable income attributable to noncontrolling interest, state taxes and the tax effects of stock compensation. 
 
 We estimate that in future annual periods, our blended statutory tax rate will be approximately 20 of EWC Ventures income or loss before income taxes. This estimated blended statutory tax rate is based on the current capital structure, excludes discrete or other rate impacting adjustments which may impact the company s income tax provision in the future and is based on our blended federal and state statutory tax rates reduced to exclude our non-taxable noncontrolling interest percentage. We expect this estimated blended statutory tax rate to increase as EWC Ventures Units and the corresponding shares of Class B common stock are exchanged for shares of Class A common stock because our nontaxable noncontrolling interest earnings will decrease. 
 
 24 

Comparison of the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Total revenue increased 2.5 million, or 1.5 , to 167.2 million during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 164.7 million for the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in total revenue was largely due to 38 net new center openings that became operational during the period from October 1, 2023 through October 5, 2024. However, the increase in total revenue was partially offset by a decrease in transactions in existing centers. 
 Product Sales 
 Product sales increased 1.6 million, or 1.8 to 95.1 million during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 93.5 million for the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in product sales was primarily due to new center openings that became operational during the period from October 1, 2023 to October 5, 2024. This increase was partially offset by the removal of a surcharge to franchisees that was put in place during the COVID pandemic to help offset elevated supply chain costs. 
 Royalty Fees 
 Royalty fees increased 0.5 million, or 1.2 , to 40.3 million during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 39.8 million for the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in royalty fees during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 was the result of new center openings that became operational during the period from October 1, 2023 to October 5, 2024. 
 Marketing Fees 
 Marketing fees increased 0.5 million, or 2.1 , to 22.8 million during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 22.4 million for the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023. Marketing fees increased as a result of new center openings that became operational during the period from October 1, 2023 to October 5, 2024. 
 Other Revenue 
 Other revenue for the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 was largely consistent with the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023, decreasing 0.1 million or 1.3 to 8.9 million for the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue decreased 2.5 million, or 5.4 , to 44.6 million during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 47.1 million for the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to negotiated cost savings. However, this decrease was slightly offset by higher product sales in the current year period driven by new center openings which became operational during the period from October 1, 2023 to October 5, 2024. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.9 million, or 4.2 , to 43.9 million during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 45.8 million for the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in payroll and benefits expense as well as the collection of cash proceeds from a legal judgment. However, these decreases were partially offset by an increase in technology expense over the same period and costs associated with a debt offering the Company decided to terminate during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024. 
 The decrease in payroll and benefits expense was primarily due to additional expense recognized during the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023 resulting from the modification of certain equity awards in that period. Payroll and benefits expense also decreased due to the reversal of equity-based compensation expense associated with forfeited awards as well as a decline in incentive compensation expense during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024. These decreases in payroll and benefits expense were partially offset by severance expense incurred in connection with the departure of our chief executive and commercial officers and the Company s return-to-office mandate as well as increased headcount in our corporate office to support the Company s growth. 
 Advertising 
 Advertising expenses increased 4.1 million, or 16.6 , to 28.7 million during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 24.6 million for the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The increase in advertising expense was attributable to new marketing initiatives designed to drive more center traffic as well as the timing of expenses associated with seasonal marketing campaigns. 
 25 

Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization for the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 was largely consistent with the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023, decreasing 0.2 million, or 1.2 , to 15.2 million for the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense, net decreased 1.1 million, or 5.2 , to 19.0 million during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024, compared to 20.1 million for the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest income from the Company s short-term investments during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 We recorded 3.8 million and 4.0 million in income tax expense for the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Income tax expense recognized in the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of non-taxable income attributable to noncontrolling interest, state taxes and the tax effects of stock compensation. Income tax expense recognized in the 39 weeks ended September 30, 2023 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of non-taxable income attributable to noncontrolling interest, state taxes and the tax effects of stock compensation. 
 
 We estimate that in future annual periods, our blended statutory tax rate will be approximately 20 of EWC Ventures income or loss before income taxes. This estimated blended statutory tax rate is based on the current capital structure, excludes discrete or other rate impacting adjustments which may impact the company s income tax provision in the future and is based on our blended federal and state statutory tax rates reduced to exclude our non-taxable noncontrolling interest percentage. We expect this estimated blended statutory tax rate to increase as EWC Ventures Units and the corresponding shares of Class B common stock are exchanged for shares of Class A common stock because our nontaxable noncontrolling interest earnings will decrease. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to our GAAP financial results, we believe the non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful in evaluating our performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental information purposes only and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP and a further discussion of how we use non-GAAP financial measures is provided below. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that EBITDA, which eliminates the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance, provides useful information to investors to assess the performance of our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain additional non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of our core operations. These items include non-cash equity-based compensation expense, non-cash gains and losses on remeasurement of our tax receivable agreement liability, contractual cash interest on our tax receivable agreement liability, transaction costs and other one-time expenses and/or gains. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance in addition to EBITDA because it eliminates the impact of other items that we believe reduce the comparability of our underlying core business performance from period to period and is therefore useful to our investors in comparing the core performance of our business from period to period. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and debt service with cash flows from operations and other sources of funding. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, proceeds from our Class A-2 Notes and Variable Funding Notes and proceeds from the issuance of equity to our stockholders. We had cash and cash equivalents of 48.0 million as of October 5, 2024. 
 Future payments under the TRA with respect to the purchase of EWC Ventures Units which occurred as part of the IPO and through October 5, 2024 are currently expected to be 201.3 million. Such amounts will be paid when such deferred tax assets are realized as a reduction to income taxes due or payable. That is, payments under the TRA are only expected to be made in periods following the filing of a tax return in which we are able to utilize certain tax benefits to reduce our cash taxes paid to a taxing authority. The impact of any changes in the projected obligations under the TRA as a result of changes in the geographic mix of the Company s earnings, changes in tax legislation and tax rates or other factors that may impact the Company s tax savings will be reflected in other expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change occurs. During the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 there were no material changes in our contractual obligations from those described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 6, 2024. 
 We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations and growth strategy for at least the next twelve months. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, capital expenditures to grow our network of centers, debt servicing costs, and general corporate needs. We have in the past, and may in the future, refinance our existing indebtedness with new debt arrangements and utilize a portion of borrowings to return capital to our stockholders. 
 Our assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and our future capital requirements could vary because of many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to acquire new centers and expand into new markets, and the 
 27 

expansion of sales and marketing activities. We may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. 
 Securitized Financing Facility 
 On April 6, 2022, the Master Issuer completed a securitization transaction pursuant to which it issued 400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Class A-2 Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Class A-2 Notes were used to repay our previous term loan, fund certain reserve amounts under the securitized financing facility, pay the transaction costs associated with the securitized financing facility, and fund a one-time special dividend to stockholders. 
 
 In connection with the issuance of the Class A-2 Notes, the Master Issuer also entered into (i) a revolving financing facility that allows for the issuance of up to 40.0 million in Variable Funding Notes, and certain letters of credit and (2) an advance funding facility with BofA, whereby BofA and any other advance funding provider thereunder will, in certain specified circumstances, make certain debt service advances and collateral protection advances. The Variable Funding Notes were undrawn as of October 5, 2024. The Class A-2 Notes and the Variable Funding Notes are referred to collectively as the Notes. 
 
 The Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Class A-2 Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the transfers of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Base Indenture, dated April 6, 2022 (the Indenture ), including events tied to failure to maintain a stated debt service coverage ratio, the sum of system-wide sales being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events (including in certain cases a change of control of EWC Ventures, LLC), an event of default and the failure to repay or refinance the Notes on the applicable anticipated repayment date. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments. 
 
 For additional information regarding our long-term debt activity, see the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements (Note 5 Long-term debt) contained elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 Generally, we are required under the TRA, which is described more fully in Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 6, 2024 in the section entitled Risks Relating to Our Organization and Structure We are required to pay the EWC Ventures pre-IPO members for certain tax benefits we may claim, and the amounts we may pay could be significant to make payments to the EWC Ventures pre-IPO members that are generally equal to 85 of the applicable cash tax savings, if any, that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize, calculated using certain assumptions) as a result of (i) increases in our allocable share of certain existing tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company and adjustments to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company, in each case as a result of (a) the purchases of EWC Ventures Units (along with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock) from certain of the EWC Ventures Post-IPO Members using a portion of the net proceeds from the initial and secondary public offerings or in any future offering or (b) Share Exchanges and Cash Exchanges by the EWC Ventures pre-IPO members (or their transferees or other assignees) in connection with or after the initial public offering, (ii) our utilization of certain tax attributes of certain affiliates of General Atlantic (the Blocker Companies (including the Blocker Companies allocable share of certain existing tax basis of EWC Ventures assets) and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. 
 Subject to the discussion in the following paragraph below, payments under the TRA will occur only after we have filed our U.S. federal and state income tax returns and realized the cash tax savings from the favorable tax attributes. Future payments under the TRA in respect of future purchases of EWC Ventures Units, Share Exchanges and Cash Exchanges would be in addition to these amounts. Payments under the TRA are computed by reference to realized tax benefits from attributes subject to the TRA and are expected to be funded by tax distributions made to us by our subsidiaries similar to how cash taxes would be funded to the extent these attributes did not exist. To the extent we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason (including because the Company s securitized 
 28 

financing facility restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us), under the terms of the TRA such payments will be deferred and accrue interest until paid. If we are unable to make payments due to insufficient funds, such payments may be deferred indefinitely while accruing interest until paid, which could negatively impact our results of operations and could also affect our liquidity in future periods in which such deferred payments are made. 
 Under the TRA, as a result of certain types of transactions and other factors, including a transaction resulting in a change of control, we may also be required to make payments to the EWC Ventures pre-IPO members in amounts equal to the present value of future payments we are obligated to make under the TRA. If the payments under the TRA are accelerated, we may be required to raise additional debt or equity to fund such payments. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason (including because the Company s securitized financing facility restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us), under the terms of the TRA Agreement such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. If we are unable to make payments due to insufficient funds to make such payments, such payments may be deferred indefinitely while accruing interest until paid, which could negatively impact our results of operations and could also affect our liquidity in future periods in which such deferred payments are made.

Operating Activities 
 During the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 40.0 million and 38.9 million, respectively, an increase of 1.1 million. This increase was primarily due to an improvement in cash flows generated by our operations as well as a decrease in working capital during the first 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024. 
 The decrease in working capital in 2024 was primarily attributable to decreases of 1.7 million and 0.2 million in inventory and accounts receivable, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of 1.6 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in inventory was largely due to the timing of inventory receipts from our vendors. The decrease in accounts receivable was mostly the result of higher billings at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 relative to those at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2024. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was largely driven by the payment of accrued bonuses partially offset by an increase in accrued advertising expenses. 
 Investing Activities 
 In the first 39 weeks of fiscal year 2024, we received proceeds of 0.1 million from the sale of a corporate-owned center. During the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we used 0.3 million and 0.8 million of cash for capital expenditures, respectively. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities was 44.5 million and 18.4 million during the 39 weeks ended October 5, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Financing activities during the 39 weeks of 2024 consisted of the following payments: 
 30.1 million used to repurchase 3,976,621 shares of Class A common stock 

6.5 million in payments made pursuant to the TRA 

3.6 million in tax distribution payments to EWC Ventures members 

3.0 million repayment on the Class A-2 Notes 

0.8 million in dividend equivalents paid to holders of EWC Ventures Units and 

0.5 million in taxes on vested RSUs paid by withholding shares.

Financing activities during the 39 weeks of 2023 consisted of the following payments: 
 
 3.2 million in payments made pursuant to the TRA 

2.8 million in dividend equivalents paid to holders of EWC Ventures Units 

3.0 million repayment on the Class A-2 Notes 

2.5 million in tax distributions to EWC Ventures members 

6.4 million used to repurchase 377,484 shares of Class A common stock and 

0.5 million in taxes on vested RSUs paid by withholding shares. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. With the exception of the immaterial error described in Note 2 - Immaterial restatement of prior period financial statements, there have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and use of estimates from those described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 6, 2024. 
 In relation to our indefinite-lived intangible trade name, significant assumptions inherent in the relief-from-royalty method include estimates of future projected business results (principally system-wide sales), long-term growth rates, royalty rates and the discount rate. We performed sensitivity analyses by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of long-term growth rate, royalty rate and discount rate estimates. Significant assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis included a discount rate of 12.8 , a royalty rate of 5.0 and a terminal growth rate of 4.0 . Based on the sensitivity analysis performed on these three key assumptions in the relief-from-royalty model, a 100 basis point decrease in the long-term growth factor and royalty rate assumptions, or a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would not have resulted in a fair value below the trade name s carrying value . 
 
 JOBS Act 
 The Company is an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 JOBS Act and may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with those standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This may make it difficult to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption and our assessment, to the extent we have made one, of the potential impact of the pronouncements on our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. 
 Item 3. Quantit ative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our Variable Funding Notes bear interest at a variable rate. 
 Our Class A-2 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50 , and therefore our interest expense related to these notes would not be affected by an increase in market interest rates. Our Variable Funding Notes bear interest at a variable index rate plus an applicable margin. 
 30 

Accordingly, increases in the variable index rate could increase our interest payments under the Variable Funding Notes. However, as the Variable Funding Notes were undrawn as of October 5, 2024 an increase in the variable index rate would not impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We are not currently exposed to significant market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; however, we have contracted with and may continue to contract with foreign vendors. Our operations may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in commodity prices. Our primary exposure to commodity price risk is the pricing of our wax purchased from our significant suppliers, which may be adjusted upwards or downwards based on changes in prices of certain raw materials used in the production process. 
 Item 4. Co ntrols and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 5, 2024. We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 5, 2024, Management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of that date due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as further described below. 
 Notwithstanding the existence of this material weakness, management has concluded that the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended October 5, 2024 are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. 
 Material weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 We identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the fair value assigned to the trade name, franchise relationships, and goodwill. Specifically, we did not design and maintain controls that operated at the level of precision required to appropriately review the valuation methodology applied by the third-party specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This material weakness resulted in an error that understated trade name and franchise relationships in the amount of 285,657 and 3,782, respectively. The error also resulted in an overstatement of goodwill for 289,439. See further discussion of this error in Note 2 of the financial statements. 
 Remediation Plan for Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The Company, with oversight from its Audit Committee, is in the process of implementing measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation plan includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
 Design and implement enhanced controls over the review of the valuation methodology used by third-party specialists including alignment with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Although the Company believes that these actions will remediate the material weakness, additional time is required to complete the design, implementation, and to test such actions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Company s remediation efforts. The material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 31 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 Except for the identification of the material weakness described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended October 5, 2024, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 32 

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Pro ceedings 
 We may be the defendant from time to time in litigation arising during the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, employment-related claims, claims based on theories of joint employer liability, data privacy claims, claims involving anti-poaching allegations and claims made by former or existing franchisees or the government. In the ordinary course of business, we are also subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information requests and subpoenas, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal actions and proceedings. Although the outcomes of potential legal proceedings are inherently difficult to predict, the Company does not expect the resolution of these occasional legal proceedings to have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flow. 
 Item 1A. R isk Factors 
 Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 6, 2024. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in our 10-K and the other information set forth in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. There have been no material changes in our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 6, 2024, except as set forth below: 
 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of this material weakness is not effective, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock. 
 
 In connection with the review of our consolidated financial statements for the period ended October 5, 2024, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective due to the existence of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the fair value assigned to the Company s trade name, franchise relationships, and goodwill. See Item 4 Controls and Procedures in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional detail. 
 
 If we are unable to timely and effectively remediate this and any other material weakness, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.
