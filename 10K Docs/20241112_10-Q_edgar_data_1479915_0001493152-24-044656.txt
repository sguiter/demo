Effective
August 22, 2023, the Company entered into an Intellectual Property License Agreement with XTEN Capital Group Inc. XTEN ),
the Company s majority shareholder which is controlled by Alexander Chong, Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of
Directors of the Company. Under the terms and conditions of the License Agreement, the Company has granted to XTEN a license for certain
Company intellectual property (the IP for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing and marketing a consumable containing
cannabis (the Alternative Market and distributing and marketing an exclusively conformed device consistent with the IP
within the United States of America (the Territory ). In lieu of royalties, XTEN will be required to purchase Company authorized
devices and to lease and/or purchase the necessary equipment and supplies to manufacture consumables from the Company at prices to be
mutually agreed upon which shall be at fair market and mutually acceptable. Furthermore, the license grants XTEN the right to sublicense
the IP rights in the Territory for the Alternative Market provided the sublicensee agrees to purchase Company authorized devices and
to lease and/or purchase the necessary equipment and supplies to manufacture consumables from the Company at prices to be mutually agreed
upon which shall be at fair market. The term of the License Agreement is for a period of three years and automatically renews every three
years, unless terminated by mutual agreement or by notice by either party of no less than six months. The License Agreement may also
be terminated for cause (as defined under the License Agreement) by either party upon 30 day notice, with an opportunity to cure. 

paid in monthly installments of . We have an option to extend for an additional five-year period. Annual increases are
tied to the U.S. Consumer Price Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor for all Urban Consumers for San Francisco-Oakland-San
Jose area. Based on the aforementioned consumer price index, the annual increase to rent beginning May 1, 2023 was bringing monthly
installments to and the annual rate to . On June 1, 2024, the monthly increase was bringing monthly installments to

We
account for our leases under ASC 842, Leases, which requires all leases to be reported on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and
lease obligations. We elected the expedients permitted under the transition guidance that retained lease classification and initial direct
costs for any leases that existed prior to adoption of the standard. 

We
categorized leases with terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that
would allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are
recorded in property and equipment, net. All other leases are categorized as operating leases. We did not have any finance leases as
of September 30, 2024. Our lease for property is for three years. We elected the accounting policy to include both the lease and non-lease
components of our agreements as a single component and account for them as a lease. 

Lease
liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings
available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives,
plus any direct costs from executing the lease. Lease assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets used in
operations. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term. When we have
options to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is
reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider these options in determining the classification and measurement of the
lease. Costs associated with the operating lease are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the
lease.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 should
be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this
report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such
as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Cautionary Statements
Regarding Forward-Looking Information appearing earlier in this report, Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors appearing in our 2023 10-K,
and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We use words such as anticipate, estimate, 
 plan, project, continuing, ongoing, expect, believe, 
 intend, may, will, should, could, and similar expressions to identify
forward looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated
growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such
statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this
report. 

Overview 

We
are a technology company. We design and develop innovative methods to heat plant-based and/or medicant-infused formulations to produce
aerosols for the efficient and efficacious inhalation of the plant and medicant constituents contained therein. We have two ways of accomplishing
this: 1) at high temperatures via induction without combustion or the constituents of combustion; and 2) at low temperatures, where we
heat an inert carrier, producing inhalable, medicant-infused aerosols while maintaining the integrity of the active ingredient(s). 

Our
high-temperature non-combusting technology is supported by 44 U.S. and international patents and pending patents. Among the applications
of our patented and patent-pending technology are those for Heat-not-Burn HnB devices. Independent tests performed by
an accredited lab on our system s prototypes supported the benefits of rapid heating, confirmed non-combustion, even at high temperatures,
and produced better toxicology results, greater than 99 better, when compared to products requiring combustion and compared to other
non-combusting technologies currently on the market. 

Our
low-temperature, aerosolizing technology is supported by 31 U.S. and international patents and pending patents. This portfolio includes
intellectual property around device designs and formulations containing a wide variety of herbal and pharmaceutical preparations. The
development stage devices feature the ability to verify the user, validate the medicant or pharmaceutical preparation and measure, meter
and monitor the proper, prescribed dosage. 

We
define our target market as the international inhalation market, a market that includes herbal, pharmaceutical, medical,
recreational and lifestyle products and ingredients. Industry experts, like Nielsen, Grand View Research, Fior Markets, published reports
in 2022 and 2023 that we have consolidated; these consolidated estimates support that this is a 950 billion USD annual market currently
and it s expected to grow to 1.1 trillion USD by 2025. The largest category within this market is the combustible tobacco market,
comprising 92 of the total. Our near term focus is on this segment, which represents the greatest opportunity for growth and the greatest
opportunity to positively impact public health and wellness. 

We
believe our HnB technologies have applications to the international tobacco industry and the growing hemp/CBD and cannabis industries.
HnBs represent the latest in tobacco and inhalable technologies, and it s likely to supplant the electronic vapor system (EVS)
technologies that include e-cigarettes and electronic nicotine delivery systems. We believe HnBs, if properly designed, will avoid many
of the issues that have proved troublesome for EVS including thermal decomposition, heating irregularities and the formation and
presence of high levels of acrolein and formaldehyde. In late 2019 Philip Morris International sought to introduce its HnB product to
U.S. markets. This product, which was sold in more than 40 countries before entering U.S. markets, like other HnB technologies, is a
device that heats a tobacco stick, rather than burning it, and testing by an independent accredited lab supports claims that the product
can potentially reduce the number of noxious chemicals found in cigarette smoke by 95 . The Philip Morris product received the approval
of the US FDA in 2019, via both a Pre-market Tobacco Authorization PMTA and in 2020 with a Modified Risk Tobacco Product MRTP designation to market the product in the US. However, the International Trade Commission ruled on September 29,
2021 that the Philip Morris product violated certain British American Tobacco patents and ruled that the Philip Morris product could
not be imported to or sold in the US. In 2023 Phillip Morris and British American Tobacco settled their patent litigation, but, as of
the date of this report, there are no HnB products on the market in the US. 

13 

Since
late 2019 we have focused our efforts on commercializing our HnB technology. This entry began with the December 31, 2019 transaction
pursuant to which we acquired the following assets from Xten Capital Group, Inc., formerly known as Chong Corporation Xten ),
a related party: 1) all patent applications and patent related documents and materials that had been assigned, owned, or held by Xten
in the field of HnB methods and designs, the backbone of the CQENS HnB system, 2) all documents and files related to device and tobacco
consumable development, 3) all versions of prototyped embodiments, consisting of both device and tobacco consumable embodiments, and
4) all files, correspondence, communications and testing related to toxicology test results and consumer focus groups. On September 30,
2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Xten pursuant to which we acquired a portfolio of 29 U.S. and international patents
and patent applications in the areas of devices and technologies for aerosolizing certain remedies and pharmaceutical preparations, as
well as the solutions and preparation for inhaled delivery. This transaction effectively terminated all prior licensing agreements and
resulting with the portfolio being assigned to the Company. 

On
September 30, 2020, we also entered into a second Asset Purchase Agreement with Xten pursuant to which we acquired certain assets including,
but not limited to, a custom-built plume and inhalation testing machine, oscilloscope with probe, multiple pieces of laboratory and workshop
equipment, computers, monitors and accessories. 

On
July 24, 2020, we entered into an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement (the Operating Agreement of Leap Technology
LLC Leap Technology with Zong Group Holdings LLC Zong and Leap Management LLC LM ). Under
the terms of the Operating Agreement and the related Contribution Agreement dated July 24, 2020 (the Contribution Agreement ),
we acquired a 55 membership interest in Leap Technology in exchange for the contribution of an exclusive, royalty-free license (the
 Leap License Agreement for the use in the Asia Pacific countries listed in the Contribution Agreement of certain of our
intellectual property, patents pending and patents related to our heated tobacco product technology. It is expected that Leap Technology
will form additional business entities to commercialize our propriety technology in those Asia Pacific countries which include China,
India, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. The goal of the joint venture is the market
development of the Company s intellectual property in the Asia Pacific region together with other initiatives and the formation
business relationships with tobacco companies who operate in the Asia Pacific region. As of the date of this report, the joint venture
is still in a pre-formative stage expected to be formalized consistent with the completion of a Restated Operating Agreement sometime
in 2024. 

On
August 17, 2021, as a result of a previously executed Memorandum of Understanding with the Barker Group of Companies, we entered into
a Joint Venture Agreement (the JV Agreement with Firebird Manufacturing, LLC Firebird ), a Barker Group
company. Under the terms of the JV Agreement the parties have agreed to organize, negotiate, and establish a limited liability company
joint venture entity (the Joint Venture Entity for the purposes of developing, manufacturing, and distributing HnB products
in the United States for an initial term of four years, subject to an automatic renewal for successive one-year terms provided certain
conditions are met. The Joint Venture Entity will be owned equally by the Company and Firebird. The Company will license its intellectual
property to the Joint Venture Entity, receiving a 10 royalty on direct consumable sales and will be responsible for designing and coordinating
the manufacture of an HnB device exclusively conformed to heat but not combust. Firebird will be responsible for manufacturing the consumable
and distributing both the device and consumables to the retail locations where the product can be lawfully sold. 

Pursuant
to the JV Agreement, the Company and Firebird will each receive on a monthly basis a distribution out of the Joint Venture profits, if
any, equal to 30 after payment of expenses. The remaining profits, if any, will be distributed annually. The JV Agreement also provides
that the parties will be prohibited from marketing a competing product for two years following the termination of the Joint Venture Entity,
subject to penalty in the amount of 5 million. The JV Agreement also sets forth in general terms the respective contributions of the
parties, including equipment, manufacturing facilities, intellectual property, and expertise. Under the terms of the JV Agreement, there
will be five managers of the Joint Venture Entity, three of whom will be designated by the Company and two of whom will be designated
by Firebird. In the event the parties formalize and enter into a Joint Venture Entity Operating Agreement, Jay Barker, an affiliate of
Firebird, may be appointed to the Company s board of directors. The JV Agreement contains customary representations and warranties. 

14 

The
execution of the Joint Venture Entity Operating Agreement is subject to formalizing the definitive Joint Venture Operating Agreement
and the execution of additional agreements, including a license agreement for the use of intellectual property, certain product development
agreements, supply agreements and such other agreements as may be necessary to further the purpose of the JV Agreement. The parties anticipate
completing all of the relevant agreements in 2024 although there are no assurances that the parties will complete and formalize these
agreements. 

On
July 13, 2022, we announced that we completed R D stages for the module for the automated manufacture of consumables for its proprietary,
patented and patent pending Heat-not-Burn system. The system heats plant-based and/or medicant-infused formulations to produce aerosols
for the inhalation of the plant and medicant constituents without combustion or the constituents of combustion, although there are no
assurances its products can be commercialized. Contemporaneous with the completion of these R D stages, effective July 13, 2022,
the Company entered into a manufacturing contract with Montrade S.p.A., Montrade a company based in Bologna, Italy, for
Montrade to manufacture and install the module. The Company made an initial payment of 589,265 USD and is required to make additional
payments of up to 1,086,465 USD for the module as certain stages are completed. Montrade is an industry leading designer and manufacturer
of machines for a wide range of products, including heated tobacco products. 

On
February 23, 2023, the Company made a payment of 138,386 for completion of the design phase. On March 29, 2023, the Company signed Amendment
1 to the manufacturing contract for additional design work and paid 12,465 of the additional 36,809 cost. As Amendment 1 was for design
work, the 12,465 was expensed. On October 18, 2023, the Company signed Amendment 2 to the manufacturing contract to modify certain components
and paid 40,091 of the 114,546 cost. 

In
2022, 130,948 of the initial payment was expensed for design services completed by Montrade. The remaining payment of 458,317 and
the additional payment on October 24, 2023, for Amendment 2 of 40,091 for a combined total of 498,408 are related to the
manufacturing of the module for the automated manufacture of consumables for the Company s proprietary, patented and patent
pending Heat-not-Burn system. The 498,408 payment is recorded as Prepaid expenses noncurrent portion. With the two
amendments added and with payments made in 2023 the Company will be required to pay up to 1,046,878. On February 26, 2024, the
Company signed Amendment 3 to the manufacturing contract, for a change to a component with a cost of 27,845 and made payment in
full on March 6, 2024 for this change. There were no financial transactions with Montrade in the second and third quarters of 2024
however manufacturing restarted this quarter with an anticipation of completion in early 2025. 

On
December 20, 2023 we entered into a Shareholder Agreement with Asahi Corporation to establish CQENS Electronics (Hong Kong) Limited CEL ),
a Hong Kong company, for design, development and manufacture of our heat-not-burn device Device ). CQENS acquired 50 membership
of CEL and holds majority of the board seats including the chair. Pursuant to the establishment of CEL, CQENS entered into an exclusive,
worldwide License Agreement with CEL for designing and manufacturing a consumer device consistent with our IP. Although the activities
of CEL in the first nine months of 2024 are minimal and are reflective of its set-up, CEL is included in our consolidated financial statements. 

Going
concern 

For
the first nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported a net loss of 7,600,197 and net cash used in operations of 1,767,595 compared
to a net loss of 3,294,441 and net cash used in operations of 1,915,537 for the first nine months of 2023. At September 30, 2024, we
had cash on hand of 3,774,365 and an accumulated deficit of 31,451,841. The report of our independent registered public accounting
firm on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue
as a going concern based upon our limited cash and no source of revenues which may not be sufficient to cover our operating costs. These
factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and pay our obligations as they become
due over the next year. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Results
of operations 

We
did not generate any revenues from our operations in the first nine months of 2024 or 2023. 

Our
total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 465.5 over those reported for the same period in 2023.
This is attributable primarily to an increase of 1015.2 in professional fees and 50.2 in research and development. The issuance of
our common shares in exchange for services contributed significantly to the professional fees accounting for 92.0 of the total.
The increase in research and development expenses in the third quarter is due to the increase in engineering services related to product
prototype configuration and development. General and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 6.0 over this same
period in 2023. 

For
the first nine months of 2024 total operating expenses increased 131.5 over those reported in the first nine months of 2023. The increase
is principally attributable to the common stock issuance for services realized in the first nine months of 2024 versus 2023 . The
decrease in general and administrative expenses of 36.1 was partially offset by an increase in research and development of 23.7 . Professional
fees increased 438.5 during the first nine months of 2024 over the first nine months of 2023. 

We
expect that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to develop our business and we devote additional resources towards promoting
that growth, most notably reflected in anticipated increases in research and development, general overhead, salaries for personnel and
technical resources, as well as increased costs associated with our SEC reporting obligations. However, as set forth elsewhere in this
report, our ability to continue to develop our business and achieve our operational goals is dependent upon our ability to raise significant
additional working capital. As the availability of this capital is unknown, we are unable to quantify at this time the expected increases
in operating expenses in future periods. 

Liquidity
and capital resources 

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its needs for cash. As of September 30, 2024, we had 3,774,365
in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital surplus of 2,151,358 compared to 350,565 in cash and cash equivalents and a
working capital deficit of 921,732 at December 31, 2023. Our current liabilities increased 518,489 from December 31, 2023,
reflecting a 22,229 increase in accounts payable, a 105,011 increase in accrued expenses, a 112,359 increase in our borrowing
from a related party, and 300,000 increase in investor deposits offset by a decrease of 21,111 in the current portion of our lease
liability. Our source of operating capital in the first nine months of 2024 came from the cash on hand at the end of 2023; 100,000
in advances from Xten, a related party; 12,359 from Mei Liu Chong, a related party and 5,308,000 of proceeds from the sale of our
common stock. Our source of operating capital in the first nine months of 2023 came from cash on hand at the end of 2022; 900,000
in advances from Xten, a common control entity; and 1,920,000 of proceeds from the sale of our common stock. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses
until it becomes profitable. As the company is not generating revenues, continued activities and expenditures to bring product(s) to
market as soon as we are able is important. Management believes the currently available funding will be insufficient to finance the Company s
operations for a year from the date of these financial statements and to satisfy our obligations as they become due. 

On
January 15, 2023, we entered into an agreement to borrow up to 1,000,000 from our largest shareholder, Xten, on an as needed basis.
Such borrowings will be for operations, interest free and due upon demand. At September 30, 2024, and as of the date of this filing,
we have borrowed the full amount. On March 5, 2024, we sold 1,400 shares of our common stock for 28,000 in a private transaction. On
March 25, 2024, we sold 14,250 shares of our common stock for 285,000 in a private transaction. On May 7, 2024, we sold 25,000 shares
of our common stock for 500,000 in a private transaction. On May 24, 2024, we sold 50,000 shares of our common stock for 1,000,000
in private transactions. On June 27, 2024, we issued 113,000 shares of our common stock for 2,260,000 in private transactions. On July
8, 2024, we sold 25,000 shares of our common stock for 500,000 in private transactions. On July 25, 2024, we sold 18,750 shares of our
common stock for 375,000 in private transactions. On August 8, 2024 we sold 7,500 shares of our common stock for 150,000 in a private
transaction. On September 3, 2024, we sold 10,000 shares of our common stock for 200,000 in a private transaction. On September 18, 2024,
we sold 500 shares of our common stock for 10,000 in a private transaction. 

16 

We
did not pay a commission or finder s fees for these transactions and are using the proceeds for working capital. We raised 1,235,000
from the private sale of our common stock during the third quarter of 2024. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we owe 1,000,000 to Xten. At the end of the first nine months of 2023, we owed Xten 900,000. 

As
of the date of this report we still will need to raise 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 in additional capital during the next 12 months. There
are no assurances we will have sufficient funds to fund our operating expenses and continued development of our products and to satisfy
our obligations as they become due over the next 12 months. In that event, our ability to continue as a going concern is in jeopardy.
There are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional capital, develop a source of revenues, report profitable
operations or to continue as a going concern, in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our company.

a related party. 

Critical
accounting policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition, accounts
receivable allowances and impairment of long-lived assets. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates,
judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated
financial statements appearing later in this report and Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing in our 2023
10-K. 

Off
balance sheet arrangements 

As
of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or
future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means
any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have
any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in
assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures,
no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls
and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure
controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Based
on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information relating to our company required
to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure due to the presence of continuing material weakness in our internal control over
financial reporting as reported in our 2023 10-K. These material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting result from
limited segregation of duties and limited multiple level of review in the financial close process. 

The
existence of the continuing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting increases the risk that a future restatement
of our financials is possible. In order to remediate these material weaknesses, we will need to expand our accounting resources. We will
continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis, however, we do not expect that the deficiencies in our disclosure controls will be remediated until such
time as we have remediated the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Subject to the availability of sufficient
capital, we expect to expand our accounting resources during 2024 in an effort to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting..
