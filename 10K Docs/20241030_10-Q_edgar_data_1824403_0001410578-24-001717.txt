Introduction We are a holding company that conducts substantially all of our business operations through Reservoir Media Management, Inc. RMM and RMM s subsidiaries. Our activities are generally organized into two operating segments: Music Publishing and Recorded Music. Operations of the Music Publishing segment involve the acquisition of interests in music catalogs from which royalties are earned as well as signing songwriters to exclusive agreements, which gives us an interest in the future delivery of songs. Operations of the Recorded Music segment involve the acquisition of sound recording catalogs as well as the discovery and development of recording artists and the marketing, distribution, sale and licensing of the music catalogs. Business Overview We are an independent music company operating in music publishing and recorded music. We represent over 150,000 copyrights in our publishing business and over 36,000 master recordings in our recorded music business. Both of our business areas are populated with hit songs dating back to the early 1900s representing an array of artists across genre and geography. Consistent with how we classify and operate our business, our company is organized in two operating and reportable segments: Music Publishing and Recorded Music. A brief description of each segment s operations is presented below. Music Publishing Segment Music Publishing is an intellectual property business focused on generating revenue from uses of the musical composition itself. In return for promoting, placing, marketing and administering the creative output of a songwriter or engaging in those activities for other rightsholders, our Music Publishing business garners a share of the revenues generated from use of the musical compositions.

Table of Contents 
 The operations of our Music Publishing business are conducted principally through RMM, our global music publishing company headquartered in New York City, with operations in multiple countries through various subsidiaries, affiliates and non-affiliated licensees and sub-publishers. We own or control rights to more than 150,000 musical compositions, including numerous pop hits, American standards, folk songs and motion picture and theatrical compositions. Assembled over many years, our current award-winning active songwriters exceed 100, while the catalog includes over 5,000 clients representing a diverse range of genres, including pop, rock, jazz, classical, country, R B, hip-hop, rap, reggae, Latin, folk, blues, symphonic, soul, Broadway, techno, alternative and gospel. Music Publishing revenues are derived from five main sources: Digital the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to musical compositions embodied in recordings distributed in streaming services, download services and other digital music services; Performance the rightsholder receives revenues if the musical composition is performed publicly through broadcast of music on television, radio and cable and in retail locations e.g. , bars and restaurants), live performance at a concert or other venue e.g. , arena concerts and nightclubs), and performance of music in staged theatrical productions; Synchronization the rightsholder receives revenues for the right to use the musical composition in combination with visual images such as in films or television programs, television commercials and video games; Mechanical the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to musical compositions embodied in recordings sold in any machine-readable format or configuration such as vinyl, CDs and DVDs; and Other the rightsholder receives revenues for use in sheet music and other uses. 
 The principal costs associated with our Music Publishing business are as follows: Writer Royalties and Other Publishing Costs the artist and repertoire A R costs associated with (i) paying royalties to songwriters, co-publishers and other copyright holders in connection with income generated from the uses of their works and (ii) signing and developing songwriters; and Administration Expenses the costs associated with general overhead, and other administrative expenses, as well as selling and marketing. 
 Recorded Music Segment Our Recorded Music business consists of three primary areas of sound recording ownership. First is the active marketing, promotion, distribution, sale and licensing of newly created frontline sound recordings from Current Artists that we own and control. This is a new area of focus for us and does not yet produce significant revenue. The second is the active marketing, promotion, distribution, sale and license of previously recorded and subsequently acquired Catalog recordings. The third is acquisition of full or partial interests in existing record labels, sound recording catalogs or income rights to a royalty stream associated with an established recording artist or producer contract in connection with existing sound recordings. Acquisition of these income participation interests are typically in connection with recordings that are owned, controlled, and marketed by other record labels. Our Current Artist and Catalog recorded music businesses are both primarily managed by our Chrysalis Records label based in London and our Tommy Boy record label based in New York City.

Net Income (Loss) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net income was 152 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 682 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was driven primarily by the loss on fair value of swaps, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of the Recoupable legal fee write-off and related interest associated with the Royalty Dispute, improved gross margin and an income tax benefit in the current period. Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net loss was 301 thousand during the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the net income of 847 thousand during the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was driven primarily by the loss on fair value of swaps, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of the Recoupable legal fee write-off and related interest associated with the Royalty Dispute, improved gross margin and an income tax benefit in the current period. Non-GAAP Reconciliations We use certain financial information, such as OIBDA, OIBDA Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, which means they have not been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reservoir s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations, measure its performance and make strategic decisions. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors and others in understanding our

Table of Contents 
 results of operations and trends in the same manner as our management and in evaluating our financial measures as compared to the financial measures of other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by our management about which items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income or any other operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Using such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation to analyze our business would have material limitations because the calculations are based on the subjective determination of our management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances. In addition, although other companies in our industry may report measures titled OIBDA, OIBDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, or similar measures, such non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from how we calculate such non-GAAP financial measures, which reduces their overall usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered alongside other financial performance measures and other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of OIBDA to operating income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) are provided below. We consider operating income before non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and non-cash amortization of intangible assets OIBDA to be an important indicator of the operational strengths and performance of our businesses and believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors because it removes the significant impact of amortization from our results of operations and represents our measure of segment income. However, a limitation of the use of OIBDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses and other non-operating income (loss). Accordingly, OIBDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, operating income, net income attributable to us and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our definition of OIBDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. OIBDA Margin is defined as OIBDA as a percentage of revenue. EBITDA is defined as earnings (net income or loss) before net interest expense, income tax expense, non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and non-cash amortization of intangible assets and is used by management to measure operating performance of the business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude items or expenses such as, among others, (1) any non-cash charges (including any impairment charges), (2) any net gain or loss on foreign exchange, (3) any net gain or loss resulting from interest rate swaps, (4) equity-based compensation expense and (5) certain unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. However, certain limitations on the use of Adjusted EBITDA include, among others, (1) it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue for our business, (2) it does not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness and (3) it does not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA measure adds back certain non-cash, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income however, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had 324,463 thousand of debt (net of 4,365 thousand of deferred financing costs) and 21,068 thousand of cash and cash equivalents. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our historical cash flows (in thousands). 

For the Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs.2023 2024 2023 Change Change Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities 21,872 18,857 3,015 16 Investing activities (10,702) (32,516) 21,814 (67) Financing activities (8,338) 19,573 (27,911) (143) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was 21,872 thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 18,857 thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers of the 3,015 thousand increase in cash provided by operating activities were an increase in earnings and royalty advance recoupments, partially offset by the timing of collection of accounts receivable and payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses and royalties payable. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities was 10,702 thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 32,516 thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in acquisitions of music catalogs. Financing Activities Cash (used for) provided by financing activities was (8,338) thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19,573 thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash (used for) provided by financing activities primarily reflects an 17,000 thousand decrease in borrowings used for investing activities and a 10,000 thousand repayment towards the secured line of credit.

 Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our subsidiaries operations, available cash and cash equivalents and funds available for drawing under our Senior Credit Facility (as described below). These sources of liquidity are needed to fund our debt service requirements, working capital requirements, strategic acquisitions and investments, capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities we may elect to make in the future. We believe that our primary sources of liquidity will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next twelve months. Existing Debt as of September 30, 2024 As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding debt consisted of 328,828 thousand borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, remaining borrowing availability under the Senior Credit Facility was 121,172 thousand. We use cash generated from operations to service outstanding debt, consisting primarily of interest payments through maturity, and we expect to continue to refinance and extend maturity on the Senior Credit Facility for the foreseeable future. Debt Capital Structure RMM is party to a credit agreement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the RMM Credit Agreement governing RMM s 450,000 thousand senior secured revolving credit facility (the Senior Credit Facility ). The Senior Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature that permits RMM to seek additional commitments in an amount not to exceed 150,000 thousand. The maturity date of the loans advanced under the Senior Credit Facility is December 16, 2027. The interest rate on borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility is equal to, at our option, either (i) the sum of a base rate plus a margin of 1.00 or (ii) the sum of a SOFR rate plus a margin of 2.00 , in each case subject to a 0.25 increase based on a consolidated net senior debt to library value ratio. RMM is also required to pay an unused fee in respect of unused commitments under the Senior Credit Facility, if any, at a rate of 0.25 per annum. Subject to market conditions, we expect to continue to take opportunistic steps to extend our maturity dates and reduce related interest expense. From time to time, we may incur additional indebtedness for, among other things, working capital, repurchasing, redeeming or tendering for existing indebtedness and acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Certain terms of the Senior Credit Facility are described below. Guarantees and Security The obligations under the Senior Credit Facility are guaranteed by us, RHI and subsidiaries of RMM. Substantially all of our, RHI s, RMM s and other subsidiary guarantors tangible and intangible assets are pledged as collateral to secure the obligations of RMM under the Senior Credit Facility, including accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents, deposit accounts, securities accounts, commodities accounts, inventory and certain intercompany debt owing to us or our subsidiaries. Covenants, Representations and Warranties The Senior Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants contained in the Senior Credit Facility limit the ability our, RHI s, RMM s and certain of its subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur debt or liens, merge or consolidate with others, make investments, make cash dividends, redeem or repurchase capital stock, dispose of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates or enter into certain restrictive agreements. Events of Default The Senior Credit Facility includes customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal when due, nonpayment of interest or other amounts, inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, violation of covenants, certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, certain ERISA events and certain material judgments, in each case, subject to customary thresholds, notice and grace period provisions.

Table of Contents 
 Covenant Compliance The Senior Credit Facility contains financial covenants that requires us, on a consolidated basis with our subsidiaries, to maintain, (i) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10:1.00 for each four fiscal quarter period, and (ii) a consolidated senior debt to library value ratio of no greater than 0.45:1.00, subject to certain adjustments. Non-compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated senior debt to library value ratio could result in the lenders, subject to customary cure rights, requiring the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with both of the financial covenants under the Senior Credit Facility. Interest Rate Swaps As of September 30, 2024, RMM had the following interest rate swaps outstanding, under which it pays a fixed rate and receives a floating interest payment from the counterparty based on SOFR with reference to notional amounts adjusted to match the amended scheduled principal repayments pursuant to the Senior Credit Facility (in thousands): 

Notional Amount at Pay Fixed Effective Date September 30, 2024 Rate Maturity September 30, 2024 100,000 2.946 December 2027 September 30, 2024 50,000 3.961 December 2027 On September 30, 2024, three previous interest rate swaps expired with original notional amounts of 8,875 thousand, 88,098 thousand and 53,030 thousand, respectively. Through the expiration date of these previous interest rate swaps, RMM paid fixed rates of 1.53 , 1.422 and 0.972 , respectively, to the counterparty and received a floating interest payment from the counterparty based on SOFR with reference to notional amounts adjusted to match the original scheduled principal repayments pursuant to the indenture agreement. Dividends Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by covenants in the Senior Credit Facility. We did not pay any dividends to stockholders during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Summary Management believes that funds generated from our operations, borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility and available cash and equivalents will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements, working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. However, our ability to continue to fund these items and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other industry-specific factors such as the ability to control music piracy and the continued transition from physical to digital formats in the recorded music and music publishing industries. It could also be affected by the severity and duration of natural or human-made disasters, including pandemics. We and our affiliates continue to evaluate opportunities to, depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, prepay outstanding debt or repurchase or retire our outstanding debt or to pay dividends. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material and may be funded from available cash or from additional borrowings or equity raises. In addition, from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity, and other factors, we may seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facility with existing cash and/or with funds provided from additional borrowings. Contractual and Other Obligations As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes, outside the ordinary course of business, in our contractual obligations since March 31, 2024. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual and Other Obligations in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 30, 2024 for information regarding our contractual obligations.

 Critical Accounting Policies As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies since March 31, 2024. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 30, 2024 for information regarding our critical accounting policies. We believe that our accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. We believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 3, Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act. As a result of the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, as previously disclosed under Part II Item 9A, Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 (the Annual Report ), our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that during the period covered by this Quarterly Report our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. Notwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Remediation Plan and Status of Material Weaknesses We continue to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses described in our Annual Report. We continue to retain third party experts on complex technical accounting issues and taxes and are seeking to hire additional accounting personnel with the requisite experience to improve our accounting processes. We are actively improving our risk assessment activities, implementing corrective actions to support our remediation of the material weaknesses previously reported. This includes, but is not limited to, providing training to process and control owners, enhancing relevant policies, procedures, guidelines and documentation templates, implementing new controls and improving documentation supporting existing controls, and enhancing segregation of duties by reducing access to our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. The evaluation over whether these improved control activities have been designed and are operating effectively, is ongoing. In future periods, we will ensure that the improved processes and controls have been designed and implemented effectively, and we will also evaluate the operating effectiveness of the new and redesigned controls.

Table of Contents 
 We will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we have concluded, through testing, that the newly implemented and enhanced controls are operating effectively. Our management will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our remediation plans in future periods and will make changes we determine to be appropriate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except as disclosed above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Controls and Procedures Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all cases of error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We may, from time to time, become involved in various legal and administrative proceedings, claims, lawsuits and/or other actions incidental to the conduct of our business. Some of these legal and administrative proceedings, claims, lawsuits and/or other actions may be material and involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties and could result in damages, fines, penalties, non-monetary sanctions or relief. We recognize provisions for claims or pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherently uncertain nature of litigation, the ultimate outcome or actual cost of settlement may materially vary from estimates. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are not involved in any legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes in the Company s risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A to the Company s Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2024.
