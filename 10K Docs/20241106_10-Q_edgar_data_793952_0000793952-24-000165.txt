 Wholesale finance receivables Allowance for credit losses ) ) ) 
 The Company s finance receivables are reported at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. Amortized cost includes the principal outstanding, accrued interest, and deferred loan fees and costs. The Company's allowance for credit losses reflects expected lifetime credit losses on its finance receivables. Based on differences in the nature of the finance receivables and the underlying methodology for calculating the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments its finance receivables into the retail and wholesale portfolios. The Company further disaggregates each portfolio by credit quality indicators. As the credit risk varies between the retail and wholesale portfolios, the Company utilizes different credit quality indicators for each portfolio. 
 The retail portfolio primarily consists of a large number of small balance, homogeneous finance receivables. The Company performs a collective evaluation of the adequacy of the retail allowance for credit losses. The Company utilizes a vintage-based loss forecast methodology that includes decompositions for probability of default, exposure at default, attrition rate, and recovery balance rate. Reasonable and supportable economic forecasts for a period are incorporated into the methodology to reflect the estimated impact of changes in future economic conditions, such as unemployment rates, household obligations or other relevant factors, over the reasonable and supportable period. For periods beyond the Company s reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to its average historical loss experience using a mean-reversion process over a period. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, or term as well as other relevant factors. 
 The wholesale portfolio is primarily composed of large balance, non-homogeneous loans. The Company s evaluation for the wholesale allowance for credit losses is first based on a loan-by-loan review to determine whether the loans share similar risk characteristics. The Company individually evaluates loans that do not share risk characteristics. Loans identified as those for which foreclosure is probable are classified as Non-Performing, and a specific allowance for credit losses is established when appropriate. The specific allowance is determined based on the amortized cost of the related finance receivable and the estimated fair value of the collateral, less selling costs and the cash that the Company expects to receive. Finance receivables in the wholesale portfolio not individually assessed are aggregated, based on similar risk characteristics, according to the Company s internal risk rating system and measured collectively. The related allowance for credit losses is based on factors such as the specific borrower s financial performance and ability to repay, the Company s past credit loss experience, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, and the value of the underlying collateral and expected recoveries. 
 The Company considers various third-party economic forecast scenarios as part of estimating the allowance for expected credit losses and applies a probability-weighting to those economic forecast scenarios. Each quarter, the Company's outlook on economic conditions impacts the Company's retail and wholesale estimates for expected credit losses. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, the Company's probability weighting of its economic forecast scenarios was weighted towards more pessimistic scenarios given continued challenging macro-economic conditions including a persistently high interest rate environment, ongoing elevated inflation levels and muted consumer confidence. 
 Additionally, the historical experience incorporated into the portfolio-specific models does not fully reflect the Company's comprehensive expectations regarding the future. As such, the Company incorporated qualitative factors to establish an appropriate allowance for credit losses balance. These factors include motorcycle recovery value considerations, delinquency adjustments, specific problem loan trends, and changes in other portfolio-specific loan characteristics. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company experienced increased retail credit losses driven by several factors connected to the macro-economic environment and related customer and industry dynamics, including the impact of higher motorcycle payments and general inflationary pressures on customers. Additionally, the Company experienced downward pressure on recovery values at auction during the first nine months of 2024. 
 Due to the use of projections and assumptions in estimating the losses, the amount of losses incurred by the Company in either portfolio could differ from the amounts estimated. Further, the Company s allowance for credit losses incorporates known conditions at the balance sheet date and the Company s expectations surrounding the economic forecasts. The

 The Company manages retail credit risk through its credit approval process and ongoing collection efforts. The Company uses FICO scores, a standard credit rating measurement, to differentiate the expected default rates of retail credit applicants, enabling the Company to better evaluate credit applicants for approval and to tailor pricing according to this assessment. For the Company s U.S. and Canadian retail finance receivables, the Company determines the credit quality indicator for each loan at origination and does not update the credit quality indicator subsequent to the loan origination date. 
 As loan performance by credit quality indicator differs between the U.S. and Canadian retail loans, the Company s credit quality indicators vary for the portfolios. For U.S. retail finance receivables, those with a FICO score of 740 or above at origination are generally considered super prime, loans with a FICO score between 640 and 740 are generally categorized as prime, and loans with FICO score below 640 are generally considered sub-prime. For Canadian retail finance receivables, those with a FICO score of 700 or above at origination are generally considered super prime, loans with a FICO score between 620 and 700 are generally categorized as prime, and loans with FICO score below 620 are generally considered sub-prime.

 The Company's credit risk on the wholesale portfolio is different from that of the retail portfolio. Whereas the retail portfolio represents a relatively homogeneous pool of retail finance receivables that exhibit more consistent loss patterns, the wholesale portfolio exposures are less consistent. The Company utilizes an internal credit risk rating system to manage credit risk exposure consistently across wholesale borrowers and individually evaluates credit risk factors for each borrower. The Company uses the following internal credit quality indicators, based on an internal risk rating system, listed from highest level of risk to lowest level of risk for the wholesale portfolio: Doubtful, Substandard, Special Mention, Medium Risk and Low Risk. Based upon the Company s review, the dealers classified in the Doubtful category are the dealers with the greatest likelihood of being charged-off, while the dealers classified as Low Risk are least likely to be charged-off. Additionally, the Company classifies dealers identified as those in which foreclosure is probable as Non-Performing. The internal rating system considers factors such as the specific borrower's ability to repay and the estimated value of any collateral. Dealer risk rating classifications are reviewed and updated by the Company on a quarterly basis.

 Retail finance receivables are contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date. Retail finance receivables at amortized cost, excluding accrued interest, are generally charged-off when the receivable is 120 days or more delinquent, the related asset is repossessed, or the receivable is otherwise deemed uncollectible. The Company reverses accrued interest related to charged-off accounts against HDFS interest income when the account is charged-off. The Company reversed million and million of accrued interest against HDFS interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30,2023, respectively. All retail finance receivables accrue interest until either collected or charged-off. Due to the timely write-off of accrued interest, the Company made the election provided under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses to exclude accrued interest from its allowance for credit losses. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, all retail finance receivables were accounted for as interest-earning receivables. 
 Wholesale finance receivables are delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the contractual due date. Wholesale finance receivables are written down once the Company determines that the specific borrower does not have the ability to repay the loan in full. Interest continues to accrue on past due finance receivables until the date the Company determines that foreclosure is probable, and the finance receivable is placed on non-accrual status. The Company will resume accruing interest on these accounts when payments are current according to the terms of the loans and future payments are reasonably assured. While on non-accrual status, all cash received is applied to principal or interest as appropriate. Once an account is charged-off, the Company will reverse the associated accrued interest against HDFS interest income. As the

 The Company is exposed to credit loss risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to its derivative financial instruments. Although no assurances can be given, the Company does not expect any of the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations. To manage credit loss risk, the Company evaluates counterparties based on credit ratings and, on a quarterly basis, evaluates each hedge s net position relative to the counterparty s ability to cover their position.

 On-Balance Sheet Asset-Backed Securitization VIEs The Company transfers U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables to SPEs that in turn issue secured notes to investors, with various maturities and interest rates, secured by future collections of the purchased U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables. Each on-balance sheet asset-backed securitization SPE is a separate legal entity, and the U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables included in the asset-backed securitizations are only available for payment of the secured debt and other obligations arising from the asset-backed securitization transactions and are not available to pay other obligations or claims of the Company s creditors until the associated secured debt and other obligations are satisfied. Restricted cash balances held by the SPEs are used only to support the securitizations. There are no amortization schedules for the secured notes; however, the debt is reduced monthly as available collections on the related U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables are applied to outstanding principal. The secured notes currently have various contractual maturities ranging from 2025 to 2032. 
 The Company is the primary beneficiary of its on-balance sheet asset-backed securitization VIEs because it retains servicing rights and a residual interest in the VIEs in the form of a debt security. As the servicer, the Company is the variable interest holder with the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. As a residual interest holder, the Company has the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits which could potentially be significant to the VIE.

 On-Balance Sheet Asset-Backed U.S. Commercial Paper Conduit Facility VIE In November 2023, the Company renewed its billion revolving facility agreement (the U.S. Conduit Facility) with third-party banks and their asset-backed U.S.

 million at the lenders discretion. Prior to the November 2022 renewal, the Company drew against the million of uncommitted additional borrowings that were allowed prior to the renewal. The Company repaid the remaining balance of these uncommitted additional borrowings in full during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Availability under the U.S. Conduit Facility is based on, among other things, the amount of eligible U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables held by the SPE as collateral. 
 Under the U.S. Conduit Facility, the assets of the SPE are restricted as collateral for the payment of the debt or other obligations arising in the transaction and are not available to pay other obligations or claims of the Company s creditors. The terms for this debt provide for interest on the outstanding principal based on prevailing commercial paper rates if funded by a conduit lender through the issuance of commercial paper. The interest rate on all outstanding debt and future borrowings, if not funded by a conduit lender through the issuance of commercial paper, is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), with provisions for a transition to other benchmark rates in the future, if necessary. In addition to interest, a program fee is assessed based on the outstanding debt principal balance. The U.S. Conduit Facility also provides for an unused commitment fee based on the unused portion of the total aggregate commitment. Prior to November 2022, when calculating the unused fee, the aggregate commitment did not include any unused portion of the million uncommitted additional borrowings allowed. There is no amortization schedule; however, the debt is reduced monthly as available collections on the related finance receivables are applied to outstanding principal. Upon expiration of the U.S. Conduit Facility, any outstanding principal will continue to be reduced monthly through available collections. The expected remaining term of the related receivables held by the SPE is approximately years. Unless earlier terminated or extended by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, as of September 30, 2024, the U.S. Conduit Facility had an expiration date of November 20, 2024. 
 The Company is the primary beneficiary of its U.S. Conduit Facility VIE because it retains servicing rights and a residual interest in the VIE in the form of a debt security. As the servicer, the Company is the variable interest holder with the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. As a residual interest holder, the Company has the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits which could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company transferred million of U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables to an SPE which, in turn, issued million of debt under the U.S. Conduit Facility. There were finance receivable transfers under the U.S. Conduit Facility during the second or third quarter of 2024 or during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 On-Balance Sheet Asset-Backed Canadian Commercial Paper Conduit Facility In June 2024, the Company renewed and amended its revolving facility agreement (Canadian Conduit) with a Canadian bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper conduit. Under the renewed and amended agreement, the Canadian Conduit is contractually committed, at the Company's option, to purchase eligible Canadian retail motorcycle finance receivables for proceeds up to C million, which was a C million increase in the total commitment. The transferred assets are restricted as collateral for the payment of the associated debt. The terms for this debt provide for interest on the outstanding principal based on prevailing market interest rates plus a specified margin. The Canadian Conduit also provides for a program fee and an unused commitment fee based on the unused portion of the total aggregate commitment. There is no amortization schedule; however, the debt is reduced monthly as available collections on the related finance receivables are applied to outstanding principal. Upon expiration of the Canadian Conduit, any outstanding principal will continue to be reduced monthly through available collections. The expected remaining term of the related receivables is approximately years. Unless earlier terminated or extended by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, as of September 30, 2024, the Canadian Conduit had an expiration date of June 30, 2025. 
 The Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Canadian bank-sponsored, multi-seller conduit VIE; therefore, the Company does not consolidate the VIE. However, the Company treats the conduit facility as a secured borrowing as it maintains effective control over the assets transferred to the VIE and, therefore, does not meet the requirements for sale accounting. 
 As the Company participates in and does not consolidate the Canadian bank-sponsored, multi-seller conduit VIE, the maximum exposure to loss associated with this VIE, which would only be incurred in the unlikely event that all the finance receivables and underlying collateral have no residual value, was million at September 30, 2024. The maximum exposure is not an indication of the Company's expected loss exposure.

 Finance Receivables, net The carrying value of retail and wholesale finance receivables is amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses. The fair value of retail finance receivables is generally calculated by discounting future cash flows using an estimated discount rate that reflects current credit, interest rate and prepayment risks associated with similar types of instruments. Fair value is determined based on Level 3 inputs. The amortized cost basis of wholesale finance receivables approximates fair value because they are generally either short-term or have interest rates that adjust with changes in market interest rates. 
 Deposits, net The carrying value of deposits is amortized cost, net of fees. The fair value of deposits is estimated based upon rates currently available for deposits with similar terms and maturities. Fair value is calculated using Level 3 inputs. 
 Debt The carrying value of debt is generally cost, net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. The fair value of unsecured commercial paper is calculated using Level 2 inputs and approximates carrying value due to its short maturity. The fair value of debt provided under the U.S. Conduit Facility and the Canadian Conduit Facility is calculated using Level 2 inputs and approximates carrying value since the interest rates charged under the facilities are tied directly to market rates and fluctuate as market rates change. The fair values of the medium-term notes and senior notes are estimated based upon rates currently available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities (Level 2 inputs). The fair value of the fixed-rate debt related to on-balance sheet asset-backed securitization transactions is estimated based on pricing currently available for transactions with similar terms and maturities (Level 2 inputs). The fair value of the floating-rate debt related to on-balance sheet asset-backed securitization transactions is calculated using Level 2 inputs and approximates carrying value since the interest rates charged are tied directly to market rates and fluctuate as market rates change.

 million in damages to the plaintiffs in a product lawsuit against the Company. The Company intends to appeal the matter and has recorded a liability for its estimated loss, which is lower than the amount awarded based on the Company's legal assessment of likely outcomes upon appeal. The Company has also recorded an asset reflecting its estimate of the insurance proceeds related to the estimated loss recognized for this matter. Given the remaining uncertainties associated with the resolution of this matter and the amount of the initial award, it is reasonably possible that the Company could incur a loss in excess of the liability recorded to date. The Company will pursue insurance recoveries for the ultimate loss related to this matter, including any loss amounts incurred in excess of the liability recorded to date. 
 Supply Matters During the second quarter of 2022, the Company received information from a Tier 2 supplier, Proterial Cable America, Inc. ("PCA" f/k/a Hitachi Cable America, Inc.), concerning a potential regulatory compliance matter relating to PCA's brake hose assemblies. As a result, out of an abundance of caution, the Company suspended all vehicle assembly and shipments for approximately two weeks during the second quarter of 2022. Since then, the Company has been working through the regulatory compliance matter with PCA, the Company s relevant Tier-1 suppliers, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the agency responsible for brake hose assembly compliance in the United States. 
 In connection with this matter, in July 2022, PCA notified NHTSA of a population of brake hose assemblies manufactured between May and July of 2022 that were non-compliant with select NHTSA laboratory test standards. Based on that filing, in August 2022, the Company notified NHTSA of the corresponding population of Harley-Davidson motorcycles containing those brake hose assemblies. In October 2022, PCA amended its original notification, expanding its population of non-compliant brake hose assemblies to include units produced by PCA for use in Harley-Davidson motorcycles beginning as early as model year 2008. In December 2022, the Company amended its August notification, expanding the population to also include Harley-Davidson motorcycles that contained PCA's newly identified brake hose assemblies. In March 2023, PCA again amended its NHTSA notification, identifying additional compliance issues with the previously identified brake hose assemblies. The Company followed PCA's March amendment with a derivative amended notification to NHTSA in May 2023. 
 In June 2023, the Company received a letter from PCA advising that PCA was investigating a new, separate potential quality issue with brake hose assemblies produced by PCA after the Company s 2022 production suspension. Due to this issue, the Company was forced to suspend production of most of the motorcycles manufactured at its York facility and run limited motorcycle manufacturing operations there for approximately two weeks. The Company continued to manufacture, among other motorcycles, the 2023 CVO Road Glide and Street Glide, which do not use PCA's brake hose assemblies. It also continued its normal motorcycle manufacturing operations at its international facilities. In connection with this matter, in late June 2023, PCA filed a new and separate NHTSA notification, identifying certain brake hose assemblies produced between June of 2022 and June of 2023 as noncompliant with select NHTSA laboratory test standards. The Company followed PCA s June 2023 notification by filing a derivative notification with NHTSA in early July 2023. 
 As permitted by federal law, both PCA and the Company have utilized NHTSA s standard process to petition the agency to determine that these compliance issues are inconsequential to motor vehicle safety ("Inconsequentiality Determinations"). If NHTSA makes the Inconsequentiality Determinations requested, the Company will be exempt from conducting a field action or recall of its motorcycles related to these matters. 
 In its inconsequentiality petitions, the Company has presented NHTSA with: (1) extensive independent, third-party and internal testing demonstrating that the brake hose assemblies at issue are robust to extreme conditions - which far exceed maximum expected motorcycle lifetime demands - with no impact to brake performance; and (2) real-world field safety data showing no documented crashes or injuries attributable to the identified compliance issues for the relevant affected populations. The Company believes its petitions are closely comparable to inconsequentiality petitions that have resulted in successful inconsequentiality determinations in the past. The Company is also confident that its position that the compliance issues are inconsequential to motor vehicle safety is strong and, therefore, no field action or recall will be necessary. 
 Based on its expectation that NHTSA will make Inconsequentiality Determinations, the Company does not expect that these regulatory noncompliance matters will result in material costs in the future, and no costs have been accrued to date.

 million to million. The Company continues to evaluate and update its estimates as it learns more about these regulatory matters, including the variables and uncertainties discussed above. The Company also continues to maintain its expectation that NHTSA will make the requested Inconsequentiality Determinations and that these regulatory matters will not result in any material field action or recall costs. If a material field action or recall were to result, the Company would seek full recovery of those amounts.

 Overview (1) 
 Net income attributable to Harley-Davidson, Inc. was 119.0 million, or 0.91 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 198.6 million, or 1.38 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, HDMC segment operating income was 55.1 million, down 120.1 million from the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in operating income from the HDMC segment for the third quarter of 2024 was driven primarily by lower motorcycle shipments as dealers adjusted inventory levels for the current retail environment. HDMC operating income was also impacted by unfavorable mix partially offset by favorable impacts related to pricing and lower promotional costs, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower operating expenses compared to the same quarter last year. Operating loss from the LiveWire segment in the third quarter of 2024 was 26.1 million compared to an operating loss of 25.3 million in the prior year quarter due primarily to lower electric balance bike volumes partially offset by lower operating expenses. Operating income from the HDFS segment in the third quarter of 2024 was 76.7 million, up 17.4 million compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to higher interest income and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher interest expense. 
 Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the third quarter of 2024 declined 13.2 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Retail sales in North America were down 10.1 . Retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles continued to be impacted by a challenging macroeconomic environment, including high interest rates adversely impacting consumer discretionary spending. Retail sales were down 22.8 in EMEA and 16.5 in Asia-Pacific driven by softness in Japan with other countries contributing to the decline, partially offset by increases in Australia and New Zealand. Refer to the Harley-Davidson Motorcycles Retail Sales and Registration Data section for further discussion of retail sales results.

Since then, the Company has been working through the regulatory compliance matter with PCA, the Company s relevant Tier-1 suppliers, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the agency responsible for brake hose assembly compliance in the United States. 
 In connection with this matter, in July 2022, PCA notified NHTSA of a population of brake hose assemblies manufactured between May and July of 2022 that were non-compliant with select NHTSA laboratory test standards. Based on that filing, in August 2022, the Company notified NHTSA of the corresponding population of Harley-Davidson motorcycles containing those brake hose assemblies. In October 2022, PCA amended its original notification, expanding its population of non-compliant brake hose assemblies to include units produced by PCA for use in Harley-Davidson motorcycles beginning as early as model year 2008. In December 2022, the Company amended its August notification, expanding the population to also include Harley-Davidson motorcycles that contained PCA's newly identified brake hose assemblies. In March 2023, PCA again amended its NHTSA notification, identifying additional compliance issues with the previously identified brake hose assemblies. The Company followed PCA's March amendment with a derivative amended notification to NHTSA in May 2023. 
 In June 2023, the Company received a letter from PCA advising that PCA was investigating a new, separate potential quality issue with brake hose assemblies produced by PCA after the Company s 2022 production suspension. Due to this issue, the Company was forced to suspend production of most of the motorcycles manufactured at its York facility and run limited motorcycle manufacturing operations there for approximately two weeks. The Company continued to manufacture, among other motorcycles, the 2023 CVO Road Glide and Street Glide, which do not use PCA's brake hose assemblies. It also continued its normal motorcycle manufacturing operations at its international facilities. In connection with this matter, in late June 2023, PCA filed a new and separate NHTSA notification, identifying certain brake hose assemblies produced between June of 2022 and June of 2023 as noncompliant with select NHTSA laboratory test standards. The Company followed PCA s June 2023 notification by filing a derivative notification with NHTSA in early July 2023. 
 As permitted by federal law, both PCA and the Company have utilized NHTSA s standard process to petition the agency to determine that these compliance issues are inconsequential to motor vehicle safety ("Inconsequentiality Determinations"). If NHTSA makes the Inconsequentiality Determinations requested, the Company will be exempt from conducting a field action or recall of its motorcycles related to these matters. 
 In its inconsequentiality petitions, the Company has presented NHTSA with: (1) extensive independent, third-party and internal testing demonstrating that the brake hose assemblies at issue are robust to extreme conditions - which far exceed maximum expected motorcycle lifetime demands - with no impact to brake performance; and (2) real-world field safety data showing no documented crashes or injuries attributable to the identified compliance issues for the relevant affected populations. The Company believes its petitions are closely comparable to inconsequentiality petitions that have resulted in successful inconsequentiality determinations in the past. The Company is also confident that its position that the compliance issues are inconsequential to motor vehicle safety is strong and, therefore, no field action or recall will be necessary. 
 Based on its expectation that NHTSA will make Inconsequentiality Determinations, the Company does not expect that these regulatory noncompliance matters will result in material costs in the future, and no costs have been accrued to date. However, it is possible that a field action or recall could be required that could cause the Company to incur material costs. There are several variables and uncertainties associated with any potential field action or recall that are not yet fully known including, but not limited to, the population of brake hose assemblies and motorcycles, the specific field action or recall required, the complexity and cost of the required repair, the need for and availability of replacement parts, the suppliers of replacement parts and the number of motorcycle owners that would participate. The Company estimates, based on its available information and assumptions, that the cost of a potential field action or recall in the aggregate, if any were to occur, could range from approximately 100 million to 400 million. The Company continues to evaluate and update its estimates as it learns more about these regulatory matters, including the variables and uncertainties discussed above. The Company also continues to maintain its expectation that NHTSA will make the requested Inconsequentiality Determinations and that these regulatory matters will not result in any material field action or recall costs. If a material field action or recall were to result, the Company would seek full recovery of those amounts.

 Interest Rates - Interest rates increased significantly during 2022 and into 2023 as central banks attempted to reduce inflation. The current higher interest rate environment has adversely impacted HDFS' interest income margin due to a higher cost of funds that is only partially offset by increased interest rates on financing products sold by HDFS. Additionally, higher interest rates have adversely impacted consumer discretionary purchases, like purchases of the Company's motorcycles, as higher borrowing costs have made these purchases less affordable or impacted the consumer's ability to obtain financing. Interest rates declined during the third quarter of 2024 and the Company expects interest rates to continue to moderate. However, interest rates remained heightened during the first nine months of 2024. 
 Suspension of Additional European Union Tariffs In April 2021, the Company received notification from the Economic Ministry of Belgium that, following a request from the European Union (EU), the Company would be subject to revocation of the Binding Origin Information (BOI) decisions that allowed it to supply its EU markets with certain motorcycles produced at its Thailand manufacturing facility at tariff rates of 6 . As a result of the revocation, all non-electric motorcycles that Harley-Davidson imported into the EU, regardless of origin, were subject to a total tariff rate of 31 from April 19, 2021 through the end of 2021. On October 30, 2021, the U.S. and EU announced an agreement related to the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum that were implemented in 2018 by the U.S. and the subsequent rebalancing tariff measures taken by the EU. This agreement suspended the additional tariffs initially imposed by the EU on the Company's motorcycles, reducing the total EU tariff rate on the Company s motorcycles from 31 to 6 , effective January 1, 2022. The lower 6 tariff rate applies to all motorcycles imported by the Company into the EU, regardless of origin. Under the initial agreement between the U.S. and the EU, the lower tariff rate remained in effect until December 31, 2023. In December 2023, the EU extended its suspension of the additional tariffs through March 31, 2025 and the U.S. extended its suspension of the additional tariffs through December 31, 2025. The U.S. and EU will monitor and review the operation of the extended agreement, seeking to conclude the negotiations on steel and aluminum tariffs by March 31, 2025. These negotiations are ongoing, and there are no assurances the U.S. and EU will reach a resolution that concludes the trade conflict on steel and aluminum tariffs beyond March 31, 2025. 
 To date, the Company continues to pursue its appeals of the revocation of the BOI decisions and the denial of its application for temporary extended reliance on the 6 tariff rate (for motorcycles produced in Thailand and ordered prior to April 19, 2021), although there is no assurance that these appeals will continue or be successful. 
 
 Guidance (1) 
 On October 24, 2024, the Company updated its expectations for 2024 as follows: 
 Given the lower than expected results for the first nine months of 2024 and sales expectations for the remainder of the year, the Company now expects HDMC revenue to be down 14 to down 16 in 2024 compared to 2023. The Company's previous expectation was for HDMC revenue to be down 5 to down 9 compared to 2023. The Company continues to expect that, for the full-year 2024, wholesale unit shipments of Harley-Davidson motorcycles will be in balance with dealer retail unit sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles resulting in a dealer inventory level of new motorcycles at the end of 2024 that is similar to the end of 2023. Therefore, the Company now expects both wholesale shipments and retail sales to be within a range of approximately 149,000 to 153,000 units for the full year of 2024, down from its previous expectation for wholesale shipments and retail sales that were within a range of approximately 163,000 to 168,000 units in 2024. Based on these updated unit expectations for 2024, retail unit sales in 2024 are expected to be down 6 to 8 compared to 2023, which is down from the previous expectation of flat to up 3 , and wholesale unit shipments are expected to be down 16 to 17 compared to 2023, which is down from the previous expectation of down 7 to 10 . 
 Based on the updated expectations for revenue and wholesale unit shipments as well as its results for the first nine months of 2024, the Company now expects HDMC operating margin as a percent of revenue to be 7.5 to 8.5 in 2024, which is lower than its previous expectation of 10.6 to 11.6 in 2024. 
 The Company now expects LiveWire motorcycle sales of 600 to 1,000 units in 2024 and continues to expect LiveWire's operating loss for 2024 to be 105 million to 115 million. The Company's previous expectation was for LiveWire motorcycle sales of 1,000 to 1,500 units in 2024. 
 The Company now expects HDFS operating income to be up 5 to up 10 in 2024 compared to 2023. The Company's previous expectation was for HDFS operating income to be flat to up 5 in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 In 2022, the Company set a productivity target to eliminate 400 million of incremental cost incurred since 2020 by the end of 2025. This target originally included a positive impact from manufacturing leverage of approximately 50 million to 70 million based on an anticipated reduction in the fixed cost per motorcycle associated with increasing production volumes. Given the decrease in production volumes in 2023 and the expected decrease in 2024, the Company has adjusted the target by removing the impact of manufacturing leverage and increasing productivity objectives in other areas. The total productivity target remains at 400 million. Excluding the impact of manufacturing leverage, the Company achieved approximately 24 million in productivity savings in 2022 and approximately 123 million in 2023. The previously reported productivity savings, 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 which included the impact of manufacturing leverage (whether positive or negative), were approximately 50 million and 70 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The Company remains focused on production efficiency, logistics network optimization and supplier cost optimization. The Company continues to expect approximately 100 million of cost productivity savings in 2024 and achieved savings of approximately 84 million during the first nine months of 2024. 
 The Company continues to expect capital investments in 2024 of between 225 and 250 million. The Company's focus remains on core product innovation, investments in manufacturing to automate and reduce costs to improve productivity as well as planned investments for LiveWire. 
 The Company's capital allocation priorities remain to fund profitable growth through The Hardwire initiatives, to pay dividends, and to execute share repurchases on a discretionary basis. In July 2024, the Company announced plans to repurchase approximately 1 billion of shares on a discretionary basis in aggregate starting in the third quarter of 2024 through the end of 2026 and remains committed to this plan. The Company now plans to repurchase up to 450 million of shares in 2024 which has been revised from its previous plan of up to 500 million. The Company believes its capital allocation priorities highlight its operating discipline, its overall cash flow generation and long-term earnings power as reflected by its continued commitment to deliver a 15 HDMC operating income margin by the end of 2025 which it would sustain for the full year 2026.

 The Company reported operating income of 105.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 209.3 million in the same period last year. The HDMC segment reported operating income of 55.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 120.1 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Operating loss from the LiveWire segment increased 0.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Operating income from the HDFS segment increased 17.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Refer to the HDMC Segment, LiveWire Segment and HDFS Segment sections for a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting operating results. 
 Other income in the third quarter of 2024 was lower than in the third quarter of 2023, impacted by a smaller benefit related to a decrease in the fair value of LiveWire's warrant liability in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 as well as lower non-operating income related to the Company's defined benefit plans. 
 The Company's effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 12.8 compared to 17.7 for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the third quarter was attributable to changes in the mix of earnings for foreign jurisdictions that are taxed at rates that differ from the U.S. statutory rate and the benefit of increased income tax credits on lower taxable income.

 (a) Data source for retail sales figures shown above is new sales warranty and registration information provided by dealers and compiled by the Company. The Company must rely on information that its dealers supply concerning new retail sales, and the Company does not regularly verify the information that its dealers supply. This information is subject to revision. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, retail sales in North America were down 10.1 driven by a 10.3 decline in the United States with additional reductions in international markets, including a 16.5 decrease in Asia Pacific as well as a 22.8 decrease in Europe. 
 U.S. retail sales were negatively impacted by a continued challenging macroeconomic environment, which included high interest rates adversely impacting consumer discretionary spending. Retail sales declines in Asia Pacific, Canada and Europe were also primarily due to challenging macroeconomic conditions. In Asia Pacific, the decline included lower sales in Japan with other countries contributing to the decline, partially offset by higher sales in Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, the level of decline on a country-by-country basis was mixed during the quarter. 
 Worldwide retail inventory of new motorcycles was approximately 60,000 units at the end of the third quarter of 2024, which is down approximately 13 from the end of the second quarter of 2024 and up approximately 20 compared to the end of the third quarter of 2023. The Company plans to continue its support of dealer efforts to reduce inventory during the remainder of 2024. (1) Retail inventory of new motorcycles is based on dealer inventory units at the end of each quarter.

 The estimated impact of significant factors affecting the comparability of net revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 were as follows (in millions): Net Revenue Cost of Goods Sold Gross Profit Three months ended September 30, 2023 1,297.0 886.3 410.7 Volume (418.8) (274.2) (144.6) Price and sales incentives 19.3 19.3 Foreign currency exchange rates and hedging (3.0) (20.6) 17.6 Shipment mix (18.1) 15.2 (33.3) Raw material prices (2.8) 2.8 Manufacturing and other costs 8.7 (8.7) (420.6) (273.7) (146.9) Three months ended September 30, 2024 876.4 612.6 263.8 
 Factors affecting the comparability of net revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 were as follows: 
 The decrease in volume was primarily due to lower motorcycle shipments. 
 Revenue was positively impacted by lower promotional activity compared to the prior year, partially offset by the elimination of the pricing surcharge late in 2023 and a fine-tuned pricing strategy for 2024. 
 Revenue was unfavorably impacted by weaker average foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared to the same quarter last year. Gross profit was favorably impacted by balance sheet remeasurement and favorable net foreign currency gains associated with hedging recorded in cost of goods sold. 
 Changes in the shipment mix had an unfavorable impact on gross profit. During the third quarter of 2024, the positive impact of changes in mix between motorcycle families was more than offset by the unfavorable impacts of model mix changes within motorcycle families and a higher mix of shipments to lower margin markets as shipments during the third quarter of 2024 declined from the same period last year at a faster rate in the U.S. than in other less profitable markets. 
 Raw material costs were lower compared to the prior year. 
 Manufacturing and other costs were negatively impacted by continued moderate inflation and unfavorable manufacturing leverage related to higher fixed costs per unit resulting from lower production volumes. These negative impacts were partially offset by supply-chain productivity gains. 
 Operating expenses were lower in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year primarily related to lower people costs, including the cost of compensation and benefits, and decreases in other discretionary spending as the Company continued to focus on cost discipline and increased productivity. 
 
 LiveWire Segment

 units sold during the quarter as compared to the same period last year. Cost of sales decreased by 1.1 million, or 15.1 , during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to lower electric balance bike volumes. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, selling, administrative and engineering expense decreased 1.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 largely as a result of cost reduction initiatives. 

HDFS Segment 
 Segment Results 
 Condensed statements of operations for the HDFS segment were as follows (in thousands): Three months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Increase (Decrease) Change Revenue: Interest income 232,990 207,673 25,317 12.2 Other income 36,492 36,261 231 0.6 269,482 243,934 25,548 10.5 Expenses: Interest expense 94,463 84,123 10,340 12.3 Provision for credit losses 57,977 60,854 (2,877) (4.7) Operating expense 40,298 39,582 716 1.8 192,738 184,559 8,179 4.4 Operating income 76,744 59,375 17,369 29.3 
 Interest income was higher for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher average outstanding finance receivables at a higher average yield. Interest expense increased due to higher average interest rates on higher average outstanding debt and deposits. 
 
 The provision for credit losses decreased 2.9 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 driven by a favorable change in the allowance for credit losses partially offset by higher actual credit losses. The favorable change in the allowance for credit losses was due to a decrease in retail receivables and a smaller increase in the retail reserve rate compared to the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by an increase in the wholesale reserve. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses considers current economic conditions and the Company s outlook on future conditions. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, the Company's outlook on economic conditions and its probability weighting of its economic forecast scenarios was weighted toward more pessimistic scenarios given continued challenging macro-economic conditions, including a persistently high interest rate environment and muted consumer confidence. Refer to the Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 for a discussion of 2024 annualized credit losses. 
 Operating expenses increased 0.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 due in part to increased insurance-related expenses, partially offset by lower employee-related costs.

 The Company reported operating income of 610.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 800.2 million in the same period last year. HDMC segment operating income was 491.5 million in the first nine months of 2024, down 213.8 million compared to the same period last year. Operating loss from the LiveWire segment increased 1.6 million compared to the first nine months of 2023. Operating income from the HDFS segment increased 25.2 million compared to the first nine months of 2023. Refer to the HDMC Segment, LiveWire Segment and HDFS Segment discussions for a more detailed analysis of the factors affecting operating income. 
 Other income in the first nine months of 2024 was higher than the same period last year impacted by a benefit related to LiveWire's warrant liability, which decreased in fair value, partially offset by lower non-operating income related to the Company's defined benefit plans. 
 The Company's effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 18.0 compared to 22.1 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was attributable to changes in the mix of earnings for foreign jurisdictions that are taxed at rates that differ from the U.S. statutory rate and the benefit of increased income tax credits on lower taxable income. 
 Diluted earnings per share was 4.27 in the first nine months of 2024, down from diluted earnings per share of 4.65 for the same period last year. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased from 146.3 million in the first nine months of 2023 to 134.0 million in the first nine months of 2024, driven by the Company's discretionary repurchases of common stock.

 Worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 5.3 during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year driven primarily by declines in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Retail sales in the United States were negatively impacted by a continued challenging macroeconomic environment, which included high interest rates adversely impacting consumer discretionary spending, partially offset by a benefit to retail sales from promotions focused on the sale of model year 2023 carryover inventory at dealers. Retail sales in Asia Pacific and Europe were soft also primarily due to challenging macroeconomic conditions. In Asia Pacific, the decline in retail sales was primarily due to lower sales in Japan and China, while lower retail unit sales in Europe were driven by declines in most of the Company's larger markets.

 Factors affecting the comparability of net revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit from the first nine months of 2023 to the first nine months of 2024 were as follows: 
 The decrease in volume was primarily due to lower motorcycle shipments. 
 Revenue was adversely impacted by the elimination of the pricing surcharge late in 2023 and a fine-tuned pricing strategy for 2024. 
 Revenue and gross profit were negatively impacted by weaker average foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar partially offset by favorable net foreign currency gains associated with hedging recorded in cost of goods sold. 
 Changes in the shipment mix of motorcycles had a favorable impact on gross profit due primarily to a higher proportion of Grand American Touring models shipped in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Raw material costs were lower than in the prior year. 
 Manufacturing and other costs were negatively impacted by unfavorable manufacturing leverage related to higher fixed costs per unit resulting from lower production volumes, continued moderate inflation and a ratification bonus related to the new collective bargaining agreements with hourly employees in Wisconsin. These negative impacts were partially offset by supply-chain productivity gains. 
 Operating expenses were lower in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year primarily due to lower people costs, including the cost of compensation and benefits, and decreases in other discretionary spending as the Company continued to focus on cost discipline and increased productivity.

 During the first nine months of 2024, revenue decreased by 7.0 million, or 30.4 , compared to the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower electric balance bike volumes partially offset by an increase in electric motorcycle volumes sold during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period last year. Cost of sales decreased by 0.7 million, or 2.8 , during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 due primarily to lower electric balance bike volumes. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, selling, administrative and engineering expense decreased 4.7 million, or 5.8 , compared to the first nine months of 2023 largely as a result of cost reduction initiatives.

 Interest income was higher for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to higher average outstanding finance receivables at a higher average yield. Other income decreased largely due to lower licensing revenue and investment income, partially offset by higher insurance-related revenue. Interest expense increased due to higher average interest rates on higher average outstanding debt and deposits. 
 The provision for credit losses was 4.5 million higher in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher actual credit losses partially offset by a favorable change in the allowance for credit losses. The favorable change in the allowance for credit losses was largely due to a smaller increase in the retail reserve rate and slower receivables growth, partially offset by a larger increase in the wholesale reserve, as compared to the first nine months of

 2023. The Company's outlook on economic conditions and its probability weighting of its economic forecast scenarios at the end of the third quarter of 2024 were weighted towards more pessimistic scenarios given continued challenging macro economic conditions, including a persistently high interest rate environment and muted consumer confidence. The Company s expectations surrounding its economic forecasts may change in future periods as additional information becomes available. 
 Annualized credit losses on the Company's retail motorcycle loans were 3.07 at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.69 at the end of the third quarter of 2023. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans at September 30, 2024 increased to 4.61 from 4.23 at September 30, 2023. The unfavorable retail credit loss and delinquency performance were driven by several factors connected to the macro-economic environment and related customer and industry dynamics, including the impact of higher motorcycle payments and general inflationary pressures on customers. Additionally, the Company continues to experience downward pressure on recovery values at auction. 
 Operating expenses increased 11.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 due in part to higher insurance-related expenses, repossession costs, and tax-related expenses.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s strategy is to maintain a minimum of twelve months of its projected liquidity requirements through a combination of cash and cash equivalents and availability under its credit facilities. The Company believes its current cash, cash equivalents and availability under its credit facilities are sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements, consistent with this strategy. 
 The Company expects to fund its on-going operations (excluding the origination of finance receivables) and its capital allocation priorities including capital expenditures, dividends and discretionary share repurchases primarily with cash flows from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents on hand. (1) The Company expects to fund the origination of finance receivables primarily with unsecured debt, unsecured commercial paper, asset-backed commercial paper conduit facilities, committed unsecured bank facilities, asset-backed securitizations and brokered certificates of deposit.

 To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. Generally, lower credit ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw the Company's ratings based on its assessment of the Company's current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. The Company s short-term debt ratings affect its ability to issue unsecured commercial paper. The Company s short- and long-term debt ratings, as of September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 Short-Term Long-Term Outlook Moody s P3 Baa3 Stable Standard Poor s A3 BBB- Stable Fitch F2 BBB+ Stable 
 The Company recognizes that it must continue to monitor and adjust its business to changes in the lending environment. The Company intends to continue with a diversified funding profile through a combination of short-term and long-term funding vehicles and to pursue a variety of sources to obtain cost-effective funding. (1) HDFS segment results could be negatively affected by higher costs of funding and increased difficulty of raising, or potential unsuccessful efforts to raise, funding in the short-term and long-term capital markets.

 Operating Activities 
 Cash flow provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 benefited from changes in working capital and lower net cash outflows related to wholesale finance receivables, partially offset by lower net income. Working capital was positively impacted primarily by larger decreases in inventory and accounts receivable in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to same period last year. 
 The Company's ongoing operating cash requirements include those related to existing contractual commitments which it expects to fund with cash inflows from operating activities. The Company's purchase orders for inventory used in manufacturing generally do not become firm commitments until 90 days prior to expected delivery. The Company's material contractual operating cash commitments at September 30, 2024 relate to leases, retirement plan obligations and income taxes. The Company's long-term lease obligations and future payments are discussed further in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . There are no required qualified pension plan contributions in 2024. The Company s expected future contributions and benefit payments related to its defined benefit retirement plans are discussed further in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company has a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 19.0 million and related accrued interest and penalties of 8.7 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement for either the liability for unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties. The Company continues to expect that it will fund its ongoing operating cash requirements related to the origination of finance receivables with the issuance of debt. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 The Company s most significant investing activities consist of capital expenditures and retail finance receivable originations and collections. Capital expenditures were 140.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 138.9 million in the same period last year. The Company's 2024 plan includes estimated capital investments between 225 million and 250 million, all of which the Company expects to fund with net cash flow generated by operations. (1) 
 Net cash outflows for finance receivables during the first nine months of 2024 were 27.5 million lower compared to the same period last year due to lower retail finance receivable originations, partially offset by lower finance receivable collections. The Company funds its finance receivables net lending activity through the issuance of debt, discussed in "Financing Activities" below. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 The Company s financing activities consist primarily of dividend payments, share repurchases, and debt activity. 
 The Company paid dividends of 0.5175 and 0.495 per share totaling 69.5 million and 72.8 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Cash outflows for share repurchases were 359.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 239.4 million in the same period last year. Share repurchases during the first nine months of 2024 include 350.0 million or 9.5 million shares of common stock related to discretionary repurchases and 9.8 million or 0.3 million shares of common stock employees surrendered to satisfy withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares.

As of September 30, 2024, there were 24.6 million shares remaining on a board-approved share repurchase authorization. In July 2024, the Company announced plans to repurchase approximately 1 billion of shares on a discretionary basis in aggregate starting in the third quarter of 2024 through the end of 2026. As a result, the Company now plans to repurchase up to 450 million of shares in 2024 which has been revised from its previous plan of up to 500 million. The Company expects to fund the share repurchases with cash flow from operations. 
 Financing cash flows related to debt and brokered certificates of deposit activity resulted in net cash inflows of 0.7 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to net cash inflows of 0.6 billion in the same period last year. The Company s total outstanding debt and liability for brokered certificates of deposit consisted of the following (in thousands): September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Outstanding debt: Unsecured commercial paper 497,373 815,081 Asset-backed Canadian commercial paper conduit facility 94,142 79,755 Asset-backed U.S. commercial paper conduit facility 378,968 272,766 Asset-backed securitization debt, net 2,244,742 2,138,684 Medium-term notes, net 3,836,572 3,257,396 Senior notes, net 746,618 745,900 7,798,415 7,309,582 Deposits, net 549,010 478,933

 Deposits HDFS offers brokered certificates of deposit to customers indirectly through contractual arrangements with third-party banks and/or securities brokerage firms through its bank subsidiary. The Company had 549.0 million and 478.9 million, net of fees, of interest-bearing brokered certificates of deposit outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The deposits are classified as short- and long-term liabilities based upon the term of each brokered certificate of deposit issued. Each separate brokered certificate of deposit is issued under a master certificate, and as such, all outstanding brokered certificates of deposit are considered below the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance coverage limits. 
 
 Credit Facilities In April 2024, the Company extended its existing 710.0 million five-year credit facility that was due to mature in April 2025 so that it now matures in April 2029 and amended the language of its existing 710.0 million five-year credit facility that matures in April 2027 so that it conforms in all respects to the April 2029 credit facility other than maturity date. The five-year credit facilities (together, the Global Credit Facilities) bear interest at variable rates, which may be adjusted upward or downward depending on certain criteria, such as credit ratings. The Global Credit Facilities also require the Company to pay a fee based on the average daily unused portion of the aggregate commitments. The Global Credit Facilities are committed facilities primarily used to support the Company's unsecured commercial paper program. 
 Unsecured Commercial Paper Subject to limitations, the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper of up to 1.42 billion as of September 30, 2024 supported by the Global Credit Facilities, as discussed above. Outstanding unsecured commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the Global Credit Facilities. Maturities may range up to 365 days from the issuance date. The Company intends to repay unsecured commercial paper as it matures with additional unsecured commercial paper or through other means, such as borrowing under the Global Credit Facilities, borrowing under its asset-backed U.S. commercial paper conduit facility or through the use of operating cash flow and cash on hand.

 The U.S. dollar-denominated medium-term notes provide for semi-annual interest payments and the foreign currency-denominated medium-term notes provide for annual interest payments. Principal on the medium-term notes is due at maturity. Unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs on the medium-term notes reduced the outstanding balance by 14.8 million and 17.3 million at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. There were no medium-term note maturities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the third quarter of 2023. During the second quarter of 2023, 706.7 million of 4.94 medium-term notes matured, and the principal and accrued interest were paid in full.

The Company used the proceeds from the debt to repurchase shares of its common stock in 2015. 
 On-Balance Sheet Asset-Backed Canadian Commercial Paper Conduit Facility In June 2024, the Company renewed and amended its revolving facility agreement (Canadian Conduit) with a Canadian bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper conduit. Under the renewed and amended agreement, the Canadian Conduit is contractually committed, at the Company's option, to purchase eligible Canadian retail motorcycle finance receivables for proceeds up to C 165.0 million, which was a C 40.0 million increase in the total commitment. The transferred assets are restricted as collateral for the payment of the associated debt. The terms for this debt provide for interest on the outstanding principal based on prevailing market interest rates plus a specified margin. The Canadian Conduit also provides for a program fee and an unused commitment fee based on the unused portion of the total aggregate commitment. There is no amortization schedule; however, the debt is reduced monthly as available collections on the related finance receivables are applied to outstanding principal. Upon expiration of the Canadian Conduit, any outstanding principal will continue to be reduced monthly through available collections. T he expected remaining term of the related receivables is approximately 5 years. Unless earlier terminated or extended by mutual agreement between the Company and the lenders, as of September 30, 2024, the Canadian Conduit had an expiration date of June 30, 2025.

 On-Balance Sheet Asset-Backed U.S. Commercial Paper Conduit Facilities VIE In November 2023, the Company renewed its 1.50 billion revolving facility agreement (the U.S. Conduit Facility) with third-party banks and their asset-backed U.S. commercial paper conduits. Under the revolving facility agreement, the Company may transfer U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables to an SPE, which in turn may issue debt to those third-party banks and their asset-backed U.S. commercial paper conduits. From November 2020 through November 2022, the U.S. Conduit Facility allowed for uncommitted additional borrowings of up to 300.0 million at the lenders discretion. Prior to the November 2022 renewal, the Company drew against the 300.0 million of uncommitted additional borrowings that were allowed prior to the renewal. The Company repaid the 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 remaining balance of these uncommitted additional borrowings in full during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Availability under the U.S. Conduit Facility is based on, among other things, the amount of eligible U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables held by the SPE as collateral. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company transferred 334.8 million of U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables to an SPE which, in turn, issued 306.0 million of debt under the U.S. Conduit Facility. There were no finance receivable transfers under the U.S. Conduit Facility during the second or third quarter of 2024 or during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The terms for this debt provide for interest on the outstanding principal based on prevailing commercial paper rates if funded by a conduit lender through the issuance of commercial paper. The interest rate on all borrowings, if not funded by a conduit lender through the issuance of commercial paper, is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), with provisions for a transition to other benchmark rates in the future, if necessary. In addition to interest, a program fee is assessed based on the outstanding debt principal balance. The U.S. Conduit Facility also provides for an unused commitment fee based on the unused portion of the total aggregate commitment. There is no amortization schedule; however, the debt is reduced monthly as available collections on the related finance receivables are applied to outstanding principal. Upon expiration of the U.S. Conduit Facility, any outstanding principal will continue to be reduced monthly through available collections. The expected remaining term of the related receivables held by the SPE is approximately 5 years. Unless earlier terminated or extended by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, as of September 30, 2024, the U.S. Conduit Facility had an expiration date of November 20, 2024. 
 Asset-Backed Securitization VIEs For all of its asset-backed securitization transactions, the Company transfers U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables to separate VIEs, which in turn issue secured notes with various maturities and interest rates to investors. All of the notes held by the VIEs are secured by future collections of the purchased U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables. The U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables included in the asset-backed securitization transactions are not available to pay other obligations or claims of the Company's creditors until the associated debt and other obligations are satisfied. Restricted cash balances held by the VIEs are used only to support the securitizations. 
 The accounting treatment for asset-backed securitizations depends on the terms of the related transaction and the Company s continuing involvement with the VIE. The Company's current outstanding asset-backed securitizations do not meet the criteria to be accounted for as a sale because, in addition to retaining servicing rights, the Company retains a financial interest in the VIE in the form of a debt security. These transactions are treated as secured borrowings, and as such, the retail motorcycle finance receivables remain on the balance sheet with a corresponding obligation reflected as debt. There is no amortization schedule for the secured notes; however, the debt is reduced monthly as available collections on the related retail motorcycle finance receivables are applied to outstanding principal. The secured notes currently have various contractual maturities ranging from 2025 to 2032. 
 Quarterly transfers of U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables to SPEs, the respective proceeds, and the respective proceeds, net of discounts and issuance costs were as follows (in millions):

Table of Contents 

 principal under the Convertible Term Loan bears interest at a floating rate per annum, as calculated on the date of each advance and as of each June 1 and December 1 thereafter. The interest rate is calculated based on the sum of (i) the forward-looking term rate based on SOFR for a six-month interest period, plus (ii) 4.00 . The Convertible Term Loan does not include affirmative covenants impacting the operations of LiveWire. The Convertible Term Loan includes negative covenants restricting the ability of LiveWire to incur indebtedness, create liens, sell assets, make investments, make fundamental changes, make dividends or other restricted payments and enter into affiliate transactions. The Convertible Term Loan has a maturity date of the earlier of (i) 24 months from the date of the first draw on the loan or (ii) October 31, 2026. In the event that the Convertible Term Loan cannot be settled in cash by LiveWire at maturity, unless otherwise agreed between Harley-Davidson, Inc. and LiveWire, the Convertible Term Loan will be converted to equity of LiveWire Group, Inc. at a conversion price per share of LiveWire Group, Inc. common stock equal to 90 of the volume weighted average price per share of common stock for the 30 trading days immediately preceding the conversion date. As of September 30, 2024, there had been no draws and there was no outstanding balance under the Convertible Term Loan. 
 Operating and Financial Covenants Harley-Davidson Financial Services Inc. and the Company are subject to various operating and financial covenants related to the credit facilities and various operating covenants under the medium-term and senior notes and the U.S. and Canadian asset-backed commercial paper conduit facilities. The more significant covenants are described below.

 Purchase or hold margin stock. 
 Under the current financial covenants of the Global Credit Facilities, the ratio of Harley-Davidson Financial Services Inc. s consolidated debt, excluding secured debt, to Harley-Davidson Financial Services' consolidated allowance for credit losses on finance receivables plus Harley-Davidson Financial Services Inc s consolidated shareholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL), cannot exceed 10.0 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the ratio of the Company's consolidated debt to the Company's consolidated debt and consolidated shareholders equity (where the Company's consolidated debt in each case excludes that of Harley-Davidson Financial Services Inc. and its subsidiaries, and the Company's consolidated shareholders equity excludes AOCL), cannot exceed 0.7 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. No financial covenants are required under the medium-term or senior notes or the U.S. or Canadian asset-backed commercial paper conduit facilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Harley-Davidson Financial Services Inc. and the Company remained in compliance with all of the then existing covenants.

 HDFS' retail credit losses have normalized in recent quarters to higher levels after a period of historically low levels of credit losses. Further, the Company believes that HDFS's retail credit losses will continue to change over time due to changing consumer credit behavior, macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of inflation and HDFS's efforts to increase prudently structured loan approvals to sub-prime borrowers. In addition, HDFS s efforts to adjust underwriting criteria based on market and economic conditions and the actions that the Company has taken and could take that impact motorcycle values may impact HDFS's retail credit losses. 
 The Company's operations, demand for its products, and its liquidity could be adversely impacted by work stoppages, facility closures, strikes, natural causes, widespread infectious disease, terrorism, war or other hostilities, including the conflict in Ukraine and the Red Sea conflict, or other factors.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To reduce such risks, the Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Sensitivity analysis is used to manage and monitor foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks. Further disclosure relating to the fair value of the Company's derivative financial instruments is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated financial statements . 
 HDMC Segment 
 The Company sells its motorcycles and related products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign country s local currency. As a result, the HDMC segment operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. The Company s most significant foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from the sale of motorcycles and related products relates to the Euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese yuan, Singapore dollar, Thai baht and Pound sterling. The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts to mitigate the effect of certain currencies' fluctuations on HDMC segment operating results. The foreign currency contracts are entered into with banks and allow the Company to exchange currencies at a future date, based on a fixed exchange rate. There have been no material changes to the foreign currency exchange rate market risk information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The Company purchases commodities for the use in the production of motorcycles. As a result, HDMC segment operating income is affected by changes in commodity prices. The Company uses derivative financial instruments on a limited basis to hedge the prices of certain commodities. There have been no material changes to the commodity market risk information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 LiveWire Segment 
 LiveWire sells its electric motorcycles, electric balance bikes and related products internationally, and in most markets, those sales are made in the foreign country s local currency. As a result, LiveWire s operating results are affected by fluctuations in the values of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies; however, the impact of such fluctuations on LiveWire s operations to date have not been material given the majority of LiveWire s sales are currently in the U.S. LiveWire plans to expand its business and operations internationally and expects its exposure to currency rate risk to increase as it grows its international presence. 
 HDFS Segment 
 The Company has interest rate-sensitive financial instruments including financial receivables, debt and interest rate derivative financial instruments. As a result, HDFS operating income is affected by changes in interest rates. The Company utilizes interest rate caps to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on its asset-backed securitization transactions. There have been no material changes to the interest rate market risk information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 HDFS also has short-term commercial paper and debt issued through the commercial paper conduit facilities that is subject to changes in interest rates, which it does not hedge. There have been no material changes to the interest rate market risk information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The Company has foreign denominated medium-term notes, and as a result, HDFS operating income is affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies and interest rates. At September 30, 2024, this exposure related to the Euro. The Company utilizes cross-currency swaps to mitigate the effect of the foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations related to foreign denominated debt. There have been no material changes to the foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate market risk information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further information concerning the Company's market risk.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon their evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The information required under this Item 1 of Part II is contained in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated financial statements , and such information is incorporated herein by reference in this Item 1 of Part II. 
 
 H-D Japan Matter - The Fair Trade Commission in Japan has an on-going investigation into Harley-Davidson Japan KK, a subsidiary of the Company. This matter is discussed further in Item 1. Legal Proceedings of the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 An investment in Harley-Davidson, Inc. involves risks, including the risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which have not materially changed except as set forth below. This risk factor has been updated to reflect the expiration date of the new collective bargaining agreements with hourly employees in Wisconsin. 
 The Company's motorcycle operations are dependent upon unionized labor. A substantial portion of the hourly production employees working in the Company's motorcycle operations are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company is currently a party to three collective bargaining agreements with local affiliates of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the United Steelworkers of America. The current collective bargaining agreement with hourly employees in Pennsylvania will expire on October 15, 2027 and the agreements with employees in Wisconsin will expire on March 31, 2029. There is no certainty that the Company will be successful in negotiating new agreements with these unions that extend beyond the current expiration dates or that these new agreements will be on terms that will allow the Company to be competitive. The Company's decisions regarding opening, closing, expanding, contracting or restructuring its facilities may require changes to existing or new bargaining agreements. Failure to renew agreements when they expire or to establish new collective bargaining agreements on terms acceptable to the Company and the unions could result in the relocation of production facilities, work stoppages or other labor disruptions, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company s business and results of operations. 
 The Company disclaims any obligation to update these risk factors or any other forward-looking statements. The Company assumes no obligation, and specifically disclaims any such obligation, to update these risk factors or any other forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward-looking statements.

 Under the share repurchase authorization, the Company s common stock may be purchased through any one or more of a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan and discretionary purchases on the open market, block trades, accelerated share repurchases or privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authority has no expiration date but may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. 
 The Company maintains a capital allocation policy to (i) fund The Hardwire strategic initiatives, including the associated capital expenditures, (ii) pay dividends and (iii) exercise discretionary share repurchases. This policy is designed to support the investment required to enhance the long-term value of the Company and to return any excess cash to shareholders. 
 The amount of capital to be allocated to share repurchases is approved periodically by the Company s Board of Directors, taking into account the Company s expected cash flow over time. The specific number of shares repurchased, if any, and the timing of repurchases are determined by Company management from time to time and will depend on a number of factors, including share price, trading volume, and general market conditions, as well as on working capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors. 
 The Harley-Davidson, Inc. 2020 Incentive Stock Plan and the 2022 Aspirational Incentive Stock Plan (Incentive Plans) and predecessor stock plans permit participants to satisfy all or a portion of the statutory federal, state, and local withholding tax obligations arising in connection with plan awards by electing to (a) have the Company withhold shares otherwise issuable under the award, (b) tender back shares received in connection with such award, or (c) deliver other previously owned shares, in each case having a value equal to the amount to be withheld. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company acquired 3,852 shares of common stock that employees presented to the Company to satisfy withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares.
