 Revenues 
 The decrease in revenue of 14,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was driven by the net decline in revenue of 3,850 in our existing retail and wholesale operations and a decline of 11,145 from the sale or closure of certain operations. This was partly offset by the expansion of new retail facilities which contributed to a revenue growth of 595 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior period. 
 Cost of Sales 
 The decrease in cost of sales of 21,068 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was driven by a cost of sales decreased of 14,585 in our existing retail and wholesale operations, including from inventory impairment, and from the sale or closure of certain operations of 6,685. This was partly offset by an increase of 202 from the expansion of new retail facilities, as compared to the prior period. 
 Gross Profit 
 The increase in gross profit of 6,668 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was directly attributable to the decline in revenues and decline cost of sales as described above. The increase in gross margin (percent) was primarily driven by maturation of production facilities as well as the adult use conversion of specific markets. 
 Operating Expenses 
 The decrease of 7,036 in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was primarily attributable to a decrease in salary and benefits expenses of 6,898, depreciation and amortization of 3,703, advertisement and promotion expense 472, professional fees of 317. This was partially offset by an increase in operating office and general expenses of 3,221, operating facilities costs of 124, and other fees and expenses of 888, and fixed asset impairment of 121. 
 Other Income, Net 
 The increase in other income, net of 40,254 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was primarily due to a gain on disposal group of 40,444, interest expense on debt of 3,906, change in fair value of the derivative liability of 25, and other income (expense), net of 1,208. This was partially offset by a decrease in change in fair value of investments of 4,195, restructuring expense 639, rental income of 536.

 Non-GAAP Measures 
 We use certain non-GAAP measures, referenced in this MD A. These measures are not recognized measures under GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation from nor as a substitute for our financial information reported under GAAP. We use non-GAAP measures including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin which may be calculated differently by other companies. These non-GAAP measures and metrics are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and liquidity and thus highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented. We also recognize that securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties frequently use non-GAAP measures in the evaluation of companies within our industry. Finally, we use non-GAAP measures and metrics in order to facilitate evaluation of operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of executive compensation. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss for the period to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023: 
 Three months ended 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net loss (1,763) (36,180) (49,974) (101,789) Income tax 21,838 2,297 40,348 19,291 Depreciation and amortization 11,767 17,929 39,314 47,607 Interest expense, net and debt amortization 13,127 14,500 38,728 41,956 EBITDA (Non-GAAP measure) 44,969 (1,454) 68,416 7,065 Adjustments: Share-based compensation 2,374 8,321 (2,588) 18,304 Transaction and other non-core costs, including costs associated with the Cresco Labs Inc. transaction, litigation expenses and other costs related to restructuring 1,720 (1,108) 4,502 Fair-value changes on investments and derivative liabilities 4,195 25 6,524 55 Adjustments for acquisition and other non-core costs 2,393 10,364 4,795 Restructuring expense 1,207 11,147 5,749 14,391 Fixed asset impairment 121 121 Net (gain) / loss on deconsolidation (40,444) 694 (39,821) 3,167 Impairment on disposal group 40 9,689 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP measure) 14,815 20,493 47,657 57,173 Revenue 114,783 129,183 362,584 382,962 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP measure) 14,815 20,493 47,657 57,173 Adjusted EBITDA margin (Non-GAAP measure) 12.9 15.9 13.1 14.9 Revenue 114,783 129,183 362,584 382,962 Gross profit 43,810 37,142 134,399 136,345 Gross margin 38.2 28.8 37.1 35.6 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, was primarily driven by declines in gross profit in the ongoing wholesale and retail operations and through restructuring and disposal activity, partially offset by improved leverage of revenues across selling, general, and administrative expenses such as facility costs, salary costs, and benefit costs.

Our future financial results are subject to significant potential fluctuations caused by, among other things, growth of sales volume in new and existing markets and our ability to control operating expenses. In addition, our financial results may be impacted significantly by changes to the regulatory environment in which we operate, on a local, state, and federal level. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our business, capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. Historically, we have relied on external financing as our primary source of liquidity. Our ability to fund our operations and to make capital expenditures depends on our ability to successfully secure financing through issuance of debt or equity, as well as our ability to improve our future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
 We are currently meeting our obligations and are earning revenues from our operations. However, we have sustained losses since inception and may require additional capital in the future. We estimate that based on our current business operations and working capital, we will continue to meet our obligations in the short term. As we continue to focus on profitability, we endeavor to remain opportunistic on growth through expansion or acquisition, therefore our cash flow requirements and obligations could materially change. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any significant external capital requirements. 
 Recent Financing Transactions

provided that the February Exchange is completed and the daily volume weighted average price of the Common Shares on Cboe is greater than C 0.87 for 5 consecutive trading days, provided that, the trading volume of the Common Shares on Cboe was equal to or greater than 600,000 Common Shares on the applicable trading dates, from the period commencing on January 1, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2024, transfer in three separate equal tranches, an aggregate of 15 million principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes in consideration of Common Shares issued at a price per Common Share equal to the greater of C 0.57 per Common Share and the 12.5 discount to the 5-day volume weighted average price of the Common Shares on Cboe prior to receipt of a Transfer notice, in each case, subject to adjustment in certain instances, on or prior to December 31, 2024. 
 
 In the event the conditions are fulfilled and the Holders fail to Transfer their 2025 Convertible Notes in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to require the Holders to Transfer some or all of the portion of the 25 million principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes still held by the Holders. Assuming all of the conditions are fulfilled, and the entire 25 million principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes are Transferred for Common Shares issued at the minimum prices set out in the Exchange Agreement, a maximum of 68,564,698 Common Shares would be issued in connection with the Repurchase. Through September 30, 2024, 10 million of the potential 25 million exchange has been completed, with 15 million remaining available for exchange, 5 million principal amount of Notes were separately exchanged into the Company 2027 Notes, as described immediately below. 
 2027 Convertible Notes 
 On March 19, 2024, the Company closed a private placement (the March 2024 Private Placement of 25,750 aggregate principal amount of 9.0 senior-secured first-lien notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes and received aggregate gross proceeds of 15,600. The 2027 Notes are senior secured obligations of the Company and were issued at 80.0 of face value. The 2027 Notes accrue interest in arrears which is payable semi-annually and mature on March 19, 2027. In connection with the offering of the 2027 Notes, the Company exchanged 5,000 of the Company s existing 6.0 2025 Convertible Notes. 
 The Company determined that the 2027 Notes represent an obligation to issue a fixed number of shares for a fixed amount of liability. In accordance with ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, a conversion feature within a financial instrument to issue a variable number of equity units fails to meet the definition of equity. Accordingly, such a conversion feature must be accounted for as an embedded derivative liability and measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon initial recognition, the Company recorded a derivative liability of 2,362 within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and a corresponding debt premium and debt issuance costs of 5,952, reflected as a reduction to the carrying value of the 2027 Notes. The Company fair values the derivative liability at each balance sheet date. Changes in fair value of the embedded derivative are recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The debt premium and debt issuance costs is amortized over the term of the 2027 Notes. 
 Mortgages 
 On August 10, 2023, the Company entered into two term loans and security agreements with a bank as follows: 
 The first agreement provides for a 6,250 mortgage on real property in Maryland and carries interest at a variable rate per annum equal to the Index plus 2.25 . The debt is repayable in 59 monthly installments and a final balloon payment due on September 1, 2028, which is estimated at 5,937 as of September 30, 2024. In connection with this mortgage, the Company incurred financing costs of 195 and netted 2,903 after the repayment of a prior outstanding mortgage on the property. 
 The second agreement provides for a 1,800 mortgage on real property in Delaware and carries interest at a variable rate per annum equal to the Index plus 2.25 . The debt is repayable in 59 monthly installments and a final balloon payment due on September 1, 2028, which is estimated at 1,710 as of September 30, 2024. In connection with this mortgage, the Company incurred financing costs of 77 and netted 1,723.

 The above table excludes purchase orders for inventory in the normal course of business. 
 Effects of Inflation 
 Rising inflation rates have had a substantial impact on our financial performance to date and may have an impact on our financial performance in the future as our ability to pass on an increase in costs is not entirely within our control. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the future that affect assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the review affects both current and future periods. 
 Judgements, estimates, and assumptions with the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are described below. 
 
 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, deposits and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, current taxes payable and other current liabilities like interest payable and payroll liabilities, derivative liability, debt, and lease liabilities. The fair values of cash and restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable, deposits, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities like interest payable and payroll liabilities, short-term debt and lease liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the relatively short-term to maturity or because of the market rate of interest used on initial recognition. The Cannabist Company classifies its derivative liability as fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). 
 Financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs to fair value measurements. The three levels of fair value contained within the hierarchy are: 
 Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
 Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and 
 Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 
 Our assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include investments, assets and liabilities held for sale, long-lived assets, and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We review the carrying amounts of such assets whenever events or changes in 
 28 

Table of Contents 

circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable or at least annually, for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Any resulting asset impairment would require that the asset be recorded at its fair value. The resulting fair value measurements of the assets are considered Level 3 measurements. 
 Financial Risk Management 
 We are exposed, in varying degrees, to a variety of financial instrument related risks. Our risk exposures and the impact on our financial instruments is summarized below: 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the risk of a potential loss to us if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The maximum credit exposure at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, is the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, subscription receivable, accounts receivable and notes receivable. We do not have significant credit risk with respect to our customers. All cash deposits are with regulated U.S. financial institutions. 
 We provide credit to our customers in the normal course of business and have established credit evaluation and monitoring processes to mitigate credit risk but have limited risk as the majority of our sales are transacted with cash. Through our Cannabist Company National Credit program, we provide credit to customers in certain markets in which we operate. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations associated with financial liabilities. We manage liquidity risk through the management of our capital structure. Our approach to managing liquidity is to estimate cash requirements from operations, capital expenditures and investments and ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our ongoing operations and to settle obligations and liabilities when due. 
 To date, we have incurred significant cumulative net losses and we have not generated positive cash flows from our operations. We have therefore depended on financing from the sale of our equity and from debt financing to fund our operations. Overall, we do not expect the net cash contribution from our operations and investments to be positive in the near term, and we therefore expect to rely on financing from equity or debt. 
 Market Risk 
 In addition to business opportunities and challenges applicable to any business operating in a fast-growing environment, our business operates in a highly regulated and multi-jurisdictional industry, which is subject to potentially significant changes outside of our control as individual states as well as the U.S. federal government may impose restrictions on our ability to grow our business profitably or enact new laws and regulations that open up new markets. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of our financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Our cash deposits bear interest at market rates. 
 Currency Risk 
 Our operating results and financial position are reported in thousands of U.S. dollars. We may enter into financial transactions denominated in other currencies, which would result in your operations and financial position becoming subject to currency transaction and translation risks. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had no hedging agreements in place with respect to foreign exchange rates. We have not entered into any agreements or purchased any instruments to hedge possible currency risks at this time. 
 Price Risk 
 Price risk is the risk of variability in fair value due to movements in equity or market prices. We are subject to the risk of price variability pursuant to our products due to competitive or regulatory pressures. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There have been no significant material changes to the market risks as disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. See also Financial Risk Management in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q.

 The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that it is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 As of the date of this filing, except as noted below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference herein. 
 The Company s efforts to obtain needed capital resources and sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to support its business operations and future growth strategies. 
 The Company s efforts to obtain needed capital resources and sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to support its business operations and future growth strategies. In addition, the Company is required to make certain interest payments on existing debt and to meet certain cash requirements, including, without limitation, maintaining 10,000 in unrestricted cash. If the Company is unable to satisfy its liquidity and capital resource requirements, the Company may be forced to restructure its obligations to creditors, pursue work-out options or other protective measures. 
 The Company s ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms or at all is subject to a variety of uncertainties. Adequate alternative financing may not be available or, if available, may only be available on unfavorable terms or subject to covenants that the Company may not be able to satisfy. There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the capital it requires. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to fund its liquidity needs, future operations or growth strategies. Furthermore, the Company may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs.
