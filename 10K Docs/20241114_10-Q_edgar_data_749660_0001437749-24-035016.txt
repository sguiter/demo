The transition services agreement expired during the first quarter of 2024 in accordance with the terms. 
 
 The Purchase Agreement contains certain representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions, including for breaches of covenants and for losses resulting from the Company s liabilities specifically excluded from the Transaction.

Products. Product revenue consists of sales of cancer detection systems and perpetual licenses. The Company also sells cancer detection systems in the form of term licenses which generally commit the customer to a three year, non cancellable subscription with annual billing at the start of each year. The Company transfers control and recognizes a sale when the product is shipped from the manufacturing or warehousing facility to the customer. 
 
 Service Contracts . The Company sells service contracts in which the Company provides professional services including product installations, maintenance, training and service repairs. The service contracts range from months to months. The Company typically receives payment at the inception of the contract and recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. 
 
 As discussed in Note 2, the Company completed the sale of its Xoft (Therapy) business line on October 23, 2023. 
 
 Contract Balances 
 
 Contract liabilities are a component of deferred revenue, current contract assets are a component of prepaid and other assets and non-current contract assets are a component of other assets. The following table provides information about receivables, current and non-current contract assets, and contract liabilities from contracts with customers.

Timing of revenue recognition may differ from timing of invoicing of customers. The Company records a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to receipt of cash payment and the Company has the unconditional right to such consideration, or unearned revenue when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. For multi-year agreements, the Company generally invoices customers annually at the beginning of each annual service period. 
 
 The Company records net contract assets or contract liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis. The Company records a contract asset for unbilled revenue when the Company s performance is in excess of amounts billed or billable. The Company classifies the net contract asset as either a current or non-current based on the expected timing of the Company s right to bill under the terms of the contract. The current contract asset balance primarily relates to a net unbilled revenue balance, which the Company expects to be able to bill for within one year. The non-current contract asset balance consists of net unbilled revenue balances with several customer which the Company expects to be able to bill for in more than one year. 
 
 Changes in deferred revenue from contracts with customers were as follows:

 In January 2024, in anticipation of the March 2024 end date of its leased warehouse in Nashua, NH, the Company entered into a month lease for a new warehouse beginning February 1, 2024 through 2027. The new warehouse space, also in Nashua, NH, is for approximately square feet with annual rent payments totaling approximately thousand for the duration of the lease.

In July 2024, the Company executed a sublease for the space. The sublease commences August 15, 2024 and ends on May 31, 2026. The sublease will provide the Company with monthly income of approximately thousand and specifies that the sublessee shall reimburse the Company for all CAM expenses, electricity, and natural gas. The Company exited the space in August 2024. The sublease caused the Company to assess the fair value of its existing right of use asset related to the 98 Spit Brook Road facility.

Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of million at that time which is reflected in the General and administrative caption in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded incremental stock-based compensation of approximately million as a result of modifications of certain stock option awards. The modifications related to extending the contractual life of certain stock options by five years for four grantees whose awards were scheduled to expire during 2023. In addition, the amount of time to exercise vested stock options upon termination for one grantee was extended from days to months. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 
 
 Options granted under the Company s stock incentive plans were valued utilizing the Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions and had the following fair values: 

Expected dividend yield None None None None 
 Expected life (average, in years) 
 Expected volatility - to - to 
 Weighted average exercise price 
 Weighted average fair value 

The Company s 2024 and 2023 average expected volatility and average expected life is based on the average of the Company s historical information. The risk-free rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury zero -coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of option grants. The Company has paid no dividends on its common stock in the past and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the future. 
 
 The Company did not grant any shares of restricted stock during the three -months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 .

The grant date fair value for restricted stock awards is based on the quoted market value of Company stock on the grant date.

 Litigation 
 
 The Company may be a party to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of the ordinary course of its business. Although the final results of all such matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that there are no current proceedings or claims pending against it the ultimate resolution of which would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, should the Company fail to prevail in any legal matter or should several legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, such matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operating results and cash flows for that particular period. In all cases, at each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or not a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable under ASC 450 , Contingencies.

 Overview 
 
 iCAD, Inc. is a global leader in AI-powered cancer detection on a mission to create a world where cancer can t hide. Cancer wins when it hides. Remaining undetected, cancer poses one of the greatest threats to life. The Company s ProFound Breast Health Suite enables medical providers and professionals to accurately and reliably identify where cancer may be hiding and when it might make its move. The ProFound Breast Health Suite offers solutions for breast cancer detection, density assessment, one or two years breast cancer risk evaluation, and cardiovascular risk related to elevated levels of breast arterial calcifications. As discussed in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein, the Company completed the sale of its Xoft business line on October 23, 2023. Unless otherwise indicated, all disclosures and amounts in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein relate to the Company s continuing operations, or its Detection segment. 
 
 Powered by the latest innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), and built on one of the largest, most diverse US-based and global data sets, the ProFound Suite uniquely offers 360-degree solutions for cancer detection, density assessment, and personalized risk evaluation, all based on a 2D or 3D mammogram s collection of images. The ProFound Detection solution scores cases and suspicious lesions, helping radiologists identify and focus on areas of most concern and highest suspicion of cancer. The ProFound Density Assessment standardizes and simplifies breast density reporting, algorithmically examining a woman s breast anatomy from the mammogram image. The ProFound Risk solution provides a near-term probability for developing breast cancer in the next one or two years, making it more actionable and relevant than generalized lifetime risk scores. The ProFound Heart Health solution identifies the presence and quantity of breast arterial calcification which is proven to correlate with calcifications elsewhere in the body, raising concern for cardiovascular or heart health concerns. 
 
 The ProFound Breast Health Suite is cleared by the US Food Drug Administration (FDA) and has received CE mark and Health Canada licensing. In November 2024, the Company announced that its ProFound Detection Version 4.0 for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis received clearance from the FDA. Used by thousands of providers serving millions of patients, ProFound is available in over 50 countries. iCAD estimates that ProFound has been used for more than 40 million mammograms worldwide in the last five years. 
 
 The Company s headquarters is located in Nashua, New Hampshire, with a manufacturing facility also located in Nashua, New Hampshire and an office in Lyon, France. 
 
 COVID-19 Impact 
 
 On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the United States and most countries of the world imposed some level of unprecedented restrictions such as travel bans and business closures which caused substantial reductions in economic activity. While the worst of the disruptions seem to have subsided as of September 30, 2024, and the pandemic emergency has been deemed to be over, we continue dealing with the impact of slowness in the overall economic recovery. Our expected results for the year ended December 31, 2024, including any interim or future periods, could reflect a continuing negative impact from continuing negative economic conditions.

Table of Contents 

We believe that our current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to sustain operations through at least the next 12 months, primarily due to cash on hand of 18.8 million at September 30, 2024 and anticipated revenue and cash collections as well as cost savings actions taken. 
 
 Global Conflicts Impact 
 
 In late February 2022, Russian military forces launched significant military action against Ukraine. In early October 2023, an armed conflict between Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups and Israeli military forces broke out with a Hamas attack on southern Israel, to which Israeli military forces retaliated. Sustained conflict and disruption in each region has continued and is likely to continue further. Economic, civil, military and political uncertainty may arise or increase in regions where the Company operates or derives revenue. Further, countries from which we derive revenue may experience military action and/or civil and political unrest; may be subject to government export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes, or trade restrictions; and experience currency, inflation, and interest rate uncertainties. While the impact of the aforementioned global conflicts to us has been limited to date, it is not possible to predict the potential outcome should such conflicts continue or expand and/or additional sanctions be imposed. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 16 and 14 , respectively, of the Company's revenue was derived from customers located outside the United States. 
 
 Xoft Sale 
 
 The Company completed the sale of its Xoft business line on October 23, 2023. The results of its operations for all periods presented are reflected as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Unless otherwise indicated, all disclosures and amounts relate to the Company s continuing operations. In addition, the Company now has one reporting segment, Detection. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if the estimate is complex in nature, requires judgment, and if different estimates were used, the results could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and the application of its policies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. See the section entitled "Critical Accounting Estimates" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024 for further discussion. 
 
 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its lingering impact, global armed conflicts and related political uncertainty, as well as dramatic inflation, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These estimates may change, as new events occur, and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Other than as described herein, there have been no additional material changes to our critical accounting estimates as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. For a comprehensive list of our critical accounting estimates, reference should be made to the 2023 10-K.

Total revenue increased by approximately 0.1 million or 3.5 , from 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is due primarily to higher product revenue as we have seen an increase in customer demand for subscription licenses and our cloud model, which currently remains a small portion of the Company s total revenue. We believe this trend could accelerate and we have begun to shift our marketing efforts to a subscription and cloud model.

The increase results from higher invested balances at similar interest rates in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 
 Other income (expense), net . Other expense was 9 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to income of 10 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was driven primarily by foreign currency transactional gains.

The difference between the Company s effective tax rates in 2024 and 2023 compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21 is primarily due to changes in valuation allowances associated with the Company s assessment of the likelihood of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. The Company has valuation allowances against substantially all of its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (in thousands, except as noted) 
 
 The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents balance of 18.8 million as of September 30, 2024, and projected cash balances are sufficient to sustain operations through at least the next 12 months. The Company s ability to generate cash adequate to meet its future capital requirements will depend primarily on operating cash flow. If sales or cash collections are reduced from current expectations, or if expenses and cash requirements are increased, the Company may require additional financing, although there are no guarantees that the Company will be able to obtain the financing if necessary. We will continue to closely monitor liquidity and the capital and credit markets. 
 
 The Company had net working capital of 19.6 million as of September 30, 2024. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 4.02 and 4.40, respectively.

Net cash used for operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.6 million, compared to 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement in net cash used for operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from the Company s focus on cost saving initiatives. We expect that net cash used for or provided by operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the timing of when we recognize revenue, collections of accounts receivable, inventory expansion due to supply chain risk, and the timing of other payments. Included in these figures are the cash flows from our discontinued Xoft business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the impact on cash flows from operating activities related to the Xoft business was cash inflows of approximately 0.1 million when excluding previously allocated marketing expenses. 
 
 Net cash used for investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 263 thousand, compared to 675 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash used for investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to the completion of the ProFound Cloud software project. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1.9 million related to sales of our common stock as well as stock option exercises by employees. 
 
 The Company is obligated to pay approximately 1.7 million for firm purchase obligations to suppliers for future product and service deliverables and 0.4 million for minimum royalty obligations. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we determined that, through an administrative error, a marketing certificate in the European Union (the EU for one of our non-breast products was not renewed. Sales of such product in the EU have constituted an immaterial amount of our total sales over the relevant five-year period. In addition, we do not expect future sales from this product to materially contribute to our total revenue. Working with relevant authorities, we resolved the administrative error during the third quarter of 2024. Sales of the non-breast product have commenced and we do not anticipate disruption to our business.

 The Company s management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) were effective at a reasonable level of assurance. 
 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. The Company conducts periodic evaluations to enhance, where necessary, its controls and procedures. 
 
 There were no changes to the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or which are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting.
