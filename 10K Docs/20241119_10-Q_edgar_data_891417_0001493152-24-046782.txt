to the recoverability and/or classification of the recorded asset amounts and/or the classification of the liabilities that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

30, 2023, an increase of 965,299 or 48 . 

Income
(loss) from investment in subsidiary 

As
a result of the sale of a majority interest in ANI, we report our share of ANI s income or loss as an investment in a subsidiary.
For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a loss of 2,155 and income of 7,969, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 there was a loss
of 21,267, and income of 19,671, respectively. 

Gain from sale of investment in subsidiary 

During the three-month period ended September 30,
2024, we sold a portion of our investment in ANI, reducing our interest from 30 to 25 . The gain on that sale is reflected in other income
for the quarter, totaling 56,067. 

Loss from sale of note receivable 

In the first two quarters of 2024, the company sold
its note receivable with ANI to various parties for a cash discount, resulting in a loss of 41,782. 

Interest
expense 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 interest expense was 12,211 as compared to 12,068 in the prior year, and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 interest expense was 37,676 up from 34,011 in the prior year. The increases for the three- and nine-month
comparative periods was due to accrued interest on convertible notes outstanding. 

Interest and other income 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest and other income was 845 as compared to other expense of 3,192 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest and other income was 8,385 as compared to
 20,010 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases are due to less interest income from ANI resulting from the sales of the notes receivable with ANI. 

Net
loss 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was 1,409,093 as compared to a loss of 699,675 for the three months ended

 2,003,577 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Liquidity
is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had a working
capital deficit of 889,966 and 38,688 of unrestricted cash as of September 30, 2024 and working capital of 454,969 and 527,462
of unrestricted cash as of December 31, 2023.

The
following table sets forth a summary of changes in our working capital from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024: 

December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024

 Working capital:

The
decrease in current assets was primarily due to a reduction in cash; a reduction in inventory and in prepaid expenses also contributed.
The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

Net
cash used by operating activities was (1,634,053) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net cash used by
operating activities of (1,057,794) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a net change of 576,259 or an increase of 54 .
Net cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from net loss from operations
of 2,979,965 adjusted for add-backs of 995,702 and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 350,208. 

Net
cash provided by investing activities was 383,036 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 10,648 for
the same period in 2023. The change was due in substantial part to gain on the sale of the note receivable from ANI and the sale of a
portion of our stock in that subsidiary. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 762,243 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting 787,500 in proceeds
from sales of common stock, warrants and convertible notes, as compared to net cash provided by continuing financing activities of 911,096
for the same period in 2023. 

Future
Liquidity and Capital Needs . 

Our
principal future uses of cash are for working capital requirements, including working capital to support increased product sales, sales
and marketing expenses and reduction of accrued liabilities. Application of funds among these uses will depend on numerous factors including
our sales and other revenues and our ability to control costs. 

Equipment
Financing and Loans 

See
note 5 to our unaudited condensed financial statements regarding our equipment loan and financing leases. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties.
We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder s equity or that
are not reflected in our condensed unaudited financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest
in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have

ITEM
3. Quantitative and Qualitative disclosures about market risk 

Not
applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM
4. Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of
the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date ). This evaluation included consideration of past practices
and new resources, the scope of which is for disclosure controls only and not the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.
Based upon this evaluation, our disclosure controls were determined not to be effective. 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. 

Changes
in Internal Control 

There
were no changes identified in connection with our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30,
2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

4. Adjustment

 the product by the Exercise Price resulting from the adjustment. 

4.1 Subdivisions,
 Combinations and Dividends. If the Company (x) pays a dividend or makes a distribution,
 in shares of Stock, on any all or substantially all shares of Stock, (y) splits or subdivides
 its outstanding Stock into a greater number of shares, or (z) combines its outstanding Stock
 into a smaller number of shares, then in each case the Exercise Price in effect immediately
 prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the Holder shall be entitled to receive the number

 immediately after the close of business on the dividend or distribution date in the case
 of a dividend or distribution and will be effective immediately after the close of business

 be. If as a result of an adjustment under this Section 4.1, the Holder is entitled to receive
 any shares of the Company other than shares of Stock, thereafter the number of other shares
 receivable upon exercise of this Option shall be subject to adjustment on terms as nearly
 equivalent as practicable to the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to the Stock. 
 
 4.2 Reclassification. 
 If any reclassification of the capital stock of the Company, by merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise,

 have the right to purchase and receive (in lieu of the shares of Stock purchasable and receivable upon the exercise
 of this Option immediately prior to the reclassification) the shares of stock, securities or other assets or property
 as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of Stock equal to
 the number of shares of Stock purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of this Option immediately prior to the
 reclassification. If the Company is acquired in an all cash transaction, the Holder shall have the right to receive
 cash equal to the value of the Option Shares issuable upon a cashless exercise of this Option immediately prior
 to the closing of the transaction. In any reclassification described above, appropriate provision shall be made
 with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder so that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation,
 provisions for adjustments of the Exercise Price and of the number of shares purchasable and receivable upon the
 exercise of this Option) shall continue to apply in relation to any shares of stock, or other securities or assets
 thereafter deliverable upon the exercise hereof. 
 
 4.3 Pro Rata Distributions.
 If the Company, at any time while this Option is outstanding, distributes to all holders of Stock for no consideration
 (w) evidences of its indebtedness, (x) any security (other than a distribution of Stock covered by the preceding
 paragraphs), (y) rights or options to subscribe for or purchase any security, or (z) any other asset, including
 cash (in each case, Distributed Property ), then, upon any exercise of this Option that occurs
 after the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution, the Holder shall be
 entitled to receive, in addition to the Option Shares, the Distributed Property that the Holder would have been
 entitled to receive if the Holder been the record holder of the Option Shares immediately prior to the record date. 

4.4 Notice
 of Adjustment. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price or any increase or decrease
 in the number of Options Shares purchasable, the Company shall give notice to the Holder.
 The notice shall state the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment and the increase
 or decrease, if any, in the number of Option Shares purchasable setting forth in reasonable
 detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which the calculation is based. 
 
 4.5 Other Notices. If
 at any time: (1) the Company declares any cash dividend upon its shares of Stock; (2) there is any capital reorganization
 or reclassification of the capital stock of the Company; (3) the Company is acquired in an all cash transaction;
 or (4) there is a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company, then the Company

 record date for the dividend, cash payment or for determining rights to vote in respect of any the reorganization
 or reclassification, and (b) if a reorganization or reclassification, at least ten days prior to the date when the
 same shall take place. 

5. No Voting
 or Dividend Rights. Nothing contained in this Option shall be construed as conferring upon the Holder
 the right to vote or to consent to receive notice as a stockholder of the Company or any other matters
 or any rights whatsoever as a stockholder of the Company prior to the purchase of Option Shares and
 then only as to the shares purchased in accordance with its terms. No dividends or interest shall be
 payable or accrued in respect of this Option or the interest represented hereby or the shares purchasable
 hereunder until, and only to the extent that, Option Shares are purchased hereunder. 

6. Transfer.
 This Option and the rights granted to Holder are not transferable by the Holder and may not be transferred,
 in whole or in part, except that vested Tranches may be exercised by the legal representative of the
 Holder for a period of 30 days after his death or disability. 

7. Lost or
 Mutilated Options. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss,
 theft, destruction, or mutilation of this Option and, in the case of any loss, theft or destruction,
 upon receipt of an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or in the case of any mutilation
 upon surrender and cancellation of the Option, the Company, at its expense, will make and deliver a
 new Option, of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Option. 

8. Modification
 and Waiver. Any term of this Option may be amended by a writing signed by the Company and the Holder.
 The observance of any term of this Option may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance
 and either retroactively or prospectively) only by a writing signed by the party against whom the waiver
 is to be enforced. 

9. Successors
 and Assigns. Subject to applicable securities laws, this Option and the rights and obligations evidenced
 hereby shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors of the Company and of the Holder. 

10. Severability.

 under applicable law, but if any provision of this Option shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable
 law, the provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating
 the remainder of the provisions or the remaining provisions of this Option.

 All notices, requests and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given
 and shall be delivered personally or via a messenger service (notice given upon receipt), or mailed
 with confirming e-mail (notice deemed given upon earlier of e-mail receipt or receipt of hard copy)
