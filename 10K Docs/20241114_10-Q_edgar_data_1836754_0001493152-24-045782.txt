the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present
value of the lease payments. The Company has elected the practical expedient to use the risk-free rate as its incremental borrowing rate.

and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical information, this discussion
and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially
from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified
below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2024 as may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC. All amounts
in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 

Throughout
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q references to we, our, us, the Company, or
 Legacy, refer to Legacy Education Inc. 

Overview 

We
provide career-focused, post-secondary education services to students at all stages of adult life, from recent high school graduates
to working parents, through our accredited academic institutions: High Desert Medical College, which we acquired in July 2010, Central
Coast College, which we acquired in January 2019, and Integrity College of Health. On December 31, 2019, we entered into a Membership
Interest Purchase Agreement with the sole member of Integrity. We purchased from the sole member of Integrity on that date 24.5 of her
interest and obtained an exclusive option to acquire her remaining membership interest upon payment of 100, which was exercised on September
15, 2020. For purposes of our financial statements, the acquisition of Integrity is deemed to have been effective as of December 31,
2019.

Recent Developments 

Regulatory Updates 

Acquisition
Agreement with Contra Costa Medical Career College 

As
previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC, on October 22, 2024, Legacy Education Antioch, LLC, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Legacy LLC (as defined herein) (the Buyer entered into an asset purchase agreement (the APA with Legacy Education Inc. (the Company ), Legacy Education, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Legacy
LLC and together with the Company and the Buyer, the Buyer Parties ), Contra Costa Medical Career College, Inc. CCMCC ),
Contra Costa Medical Career College Online, Inc. CCMCC Online and together with CCMCC, Sellers and, solely
with respect to certain portions of the APA, Stacey Orozco and Bulmaro Orozco, the sole owners CCMCC and CCMCC Online (the CCMCC
Transaction ). 

When
a company acquires an institution that is eligible to participate in the Title IV Programs, like CCMCC, the acquisition generally will
result in the institution undergoing a change of ownership resulting in a change of control as defined by ED and under the rules of other
educational agencies and accreditors. Upon such a change, an institution s eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs
is generally suspended until it has applied for recertification by ED as an eligible school under its new ownership, which requires that
the school also re-establish its state authorization and accreditation. ED may temporarily and provisionally certify an institution seeking
approval of a change of control under certain circumstances while ED reviews the institution s application. The temporary provisional
certification typically remains in effect on a month-to-month basis during ED s review of the application as long as the school
timely submits certain documentation during the course of ED s review. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of ED s review
of the change of ownership of CCMCC. 

The
time required for ED to act on such an application may vary substantially. ED recertification of an institution following a change
of control will be on a provisional basis if ED approves the institution s application and could contain restrictions or
conditions depending on the outcome of its review of the institution under the new ownership including its administrative capability
and financial stability. Under ED regulations that took effect July 1, 2023, an institution must submit certain information and
documentation at least 90 days in advance of the change in ownership including, for example, notice to current and prospective
students of the planned change in ownership. The parties have submitted this documentation to ED. If ED contends that the
documentation is insufficient and we are unable to take timely corrective action, we could be required to delay the closing of the
transaction. 

The
approval processes for state and accrediting agencies vary in scope and timing with some agencies requiring approval prior to the acquisition
and others not conducting their review until after the acquisition has taken place. With regard to the agencies that accredit CCMCC and
CCMCC Online, authorize them to operate in the state of California, or approve their programs: 

California
 Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education BPPE : Institutions
 that are licensed by BPPE by means of accreditation, like CCMC, are required to notify BPPE of the change within 30 days of the change and demonstrate
 that the substantive change was made in accordance with the institution s accreditation standards. 

2 

Accrediting
 Council for Continuing Education and Training ACCET : ACCET accreditation standards require that institutions
 undergoing a change in ownership or control submit notice at least ten days prior to a prospective agreement for the change. ACCET
 also requires submission of an application for approval of the change in ownership or control within ten days following the change.

California
 State Approving Agency for Veterans Education CSAAVE : CSAAVE requires approved institutions to make a
 post-change submission to CSAAVE for approval of the change when there has been a material change to the institution s current
 approval. 

Accreditation
 Bureau of Health Education Schools ABHES : ABHES requires institutions that hold ABHES programmatic
 accreditation to notify it of any change in organizational oversight or legal structure, and to submit a completed application for
 change in legal status, ownership, or control within five days after the change. 

California
 Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians BVNPT : The parties plan to provide notice
 to BVNPT after the transaction occurs and to respond to any subsequent instructions from the agency. 

California
 Department of Public Health, Laboratory Field Services CDPH : CDPH requires certain training programs
 undergoing a change of ownership to notify CDPH within 30 days after the change has occurred and submit a new application package. 

If
agencies require us to obtain approvals in connection with the CCMCC Transaction, we will be required to undergo an application process
for approvals from the applicable agencies and could be subject to conditions or restrictions (or loss of approval) depending on the
outcome of the approval process. We will be required to make or obtain notices and/or approvals prior to the CCMCC Transaction from those
agencies that require notice and/or approval to be made or obtained prior to the occurrence of a change in ownership or control. If we
move forward with the CCMCC Transaction without making or obtaining required pre-closing notices and approvals, we could be subject to
sanctions by the applicable agencies including loss of CCMCC s approvals from these agencies. 

Key
Financial Metrics 

Revenue 

Tuition
revenue is primarily derived from postsecondary education services provided to students. Generally, tuition and other fees are paid upfront
and recorded in contract liabilities in advance of the date when education services are provided to the student. A tuition receivable
is recorded for the portion of tuition not paid in advance. In some instances, installment billing is available to students which reduces
the amount of cash consideration received in advance of performing the service. The contractual terms and conditions associated with
installment billing indicate that the student is liable for the total contract price, therefore mitigating the Company s exposure
to losses associated with nonpayment. Tuition revenue is recognized ratably over the instruction period. The Company generally uses the
time elapsed method, an input measure, as it best depicts the simultaneous consumption and delivery of tuition services. Revenue associated
with distinct course materials is recognized at the point of time when control transfers to the student, generally when the materials
are delivered to the student. Revenue associated with lab services is recognized over the period of time when the service is performed. 

Enrollments 

Enrollments
are a function of the number of continuing students at the beginning of each period and new enrollments during the period, offset by
students who either graduated or withdrew during the period. 

Costs
and expenses 

Educational
service. This expense consists primarily of costs related to the administration and delivery of educational programs by our academic
institutions. This expense category includes salaries, benefits, share-based compensation, student books, student supplies and occupancy
costs. 

3 

General
and administrative. This expense includes bad debt expense, share-based compensation, legal and professional fees, insurance, accreditation
fees, and travel of employees engaged in corporate management, finance, human resources, compliance and other corporate functions. This
expense also includes marketing and advertising costs, which are expensed in the fiscal year incurred. 

Depreciation
and amortization . This expense reflects depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, amortization of assets under capital
leases and amortization of intangible assets. 

Interest
expense 

This
expense reflects interest paid under notes issued to our investors, IRS interest, non-cash interest related to unit option grants, interest
related to notes associated with CCC, and other debt related interest. 

Interest
income 

This
income relates to interest received from investments. 

Factors
Affecting Comparability 

We
believe the following factors have had, or can be expected to have, a significant effect on the comparability of recent or future results
of operations: 

Seasonality 

Our
operations are generally subject to seasonal trends. We generally experience a seasonal increase in new enrollments during the first
quarter of our fiscal year, as well as during the third quarter each year, when most other colleges and universities begin their fall
semesters and subsequent to holiday break. While we enroll students throughout the year, our second quarter revenue generally is lower
than other quarters due to the holiday season. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

The
preparation of the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions
on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the evaluation of the Company s distinct performance obligations, the valuation
of equity instruments and valuation allowances for credit losses related to accounts receivable. 

Allowance
for credit losses 

We
record an allowance for doubtful credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of our students
to make required payments, which includes the recovery of financial aid funds advanced to a student for amounts in excess of the student s
cost of tuition and related fees. We determine the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an analysis of our historical
bad debt experience, current economic trends, and the aging of the accounts receivable and student status. We apply reserves to our receivables
based upon an estimate of the risk presented by the age of the receivables and student status. We write off account receivable balances
of inactive students at the earlier of the time the balances were deemed uncollectible, or one year after the revenue is generated. Bad
debt expense is recorded as a general and administrative expense in the income statement. The Company performs an analysis annually to
determine which accounts are uncollectable and write them off. 

4 

Impairment
of long-lived assets 

We
evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets for impairment, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison
of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered
to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair
value of the assets. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows. We
had [no long-lived asset impairments as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.] 

Income
taxes 

GAAP
requires management to evaluate tax positions taken by us and recognize a tax liability if we have taken an uncertain position that is
more likely than not would be sustained upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Management has analyzed our tax positions and
believes there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability or disclosure in
the financial statement. 

Corporate
tax applies to corporations and limited liability companies that elect to be treated as corporations. The federal income tax rate for
c-corporations is 21 and the state tax rate is 8.84 , and it applies to net taxable income from business activity in California. 

Corporations
are not subject to the state s franchise tax, but they are subject to the alternative minimum tax AMT of 6.65 ,
which limits the effectiveness of a business writing off expenses against income to lower its corporate tax rate. C-corporations pay
the state corporate tax of 8.84 or AMT of 6.65 , depending on whether they claim net taxable income. 

We
account for income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences
of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be realized. 

Share
Based Compensation 

The
Company utilizes ASC 718, Stock Compensation, related to accounting for share-based payments and, accordingly, records compensation
expense for share-based awards based upon an assessment of the grant date fair value for stock options and restricted stock awards. The
Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of
the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the Company s
consolidated statements of operations. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation awards using the Black-Scholes
model. This model requires the Company to estimate the expected volatility and value of its common stock and the expected term of the
stock options, all of which are highly complex and subjective variables. The expected life was calculated based on the simplified method
as described by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, Share-Based Payment. The Company s estimate of expected volatility was
based on the volatility of peers. The Company has selected a risk-free rate based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury securities
with a maturity equivalent to the expected term of the options. The Company accounts for forfeitures upon occurrence. 

Goodwill
and Other Indefinite-lived Assets 

We
test goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the asset may be impaired. There were no goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments for the periods
presented, and based on current qualitative impairment tests, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not as risk of
failing.

Revenue .
Our revenue was approximately 14.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 10.4 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 3.6 million, or approximately 35.1 . The increase is primarily
due to a 25.4 increase in ending enrollment from 2,024 to 2,539 supported by a 23.3 increase in starts from 627 to 773 in the quarter compared to prior year.
Additionally, we experienced favorable program mix to higher earning programs within the quarter. 

Educational
services . Our educational services expense was approximately 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to approximately 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 1.5 million, or approximately
25.7 . The increase was primarily attributable to the increased instructional and staffing required to support the increase in enrollments
as well as increased rent and externship fees. 

General
and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expense was approximately 4.0 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024 compared to approximately 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 0.8 million,
or approximately 25.7 . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing expense, professional fees and bad debt expense.
Of the total general and administrative expense, 1.2 million and 1.1 million relate to marketing expense relate for the first quarter
of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. 

Depreciation
and amortization. Our depreciation and amortization expense was approximately 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30,
2024 compared to approximately 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest
expense . Our interest expense was approximately 0.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 0.0
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Income
tax expense. Our income tax expense was approximately 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately
 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 0.4 million, or approximately 90.9 . The increase
is primarily attributable to increase in income. 

Net
Income. Our net income was approximately 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 1.1
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 1.0 million, or approximately 95.5 , due to the
reasons mentioned above.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
cash and cash equivalents were approximately 21.5 million and 10.4 million as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

We
are not party to a revolving line of credit or other debt facility. 

Based
on our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that our cash flow from operations, the proceeds from our initial
public offering and other sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations,
planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. 

Capital
expenditures were approximately 0.2 million and 0.2 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

Title
IV and other government funding 

A
significant portion of our revenue is derived from student tuition payments funded by the Title IV Programs. As such, the timing of disbursements
under the Title IV Programs is based on federal regulations and our ability to successfully and timely arrange financial aid for our
students. Title IV Program funds are generally provided in multiple disbursements before we earn a significant portion of tuition and
fees and incur related expenses over the period of instruction. Students must apply for new Title IV Program loans and grants each academic
year. These factors, together with the timing of our students beginning their programs, affect our operating cash flow. 

Financial
responsibility 

Based
on the most recent fiscal year-end financial statements, we satisfied the composite score requirement of the financial responsibility
test which institutions must satisfy in order to participate in the Title IV Programs. 

Cash
Flow Activities for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Operating
activities 

Net
cash provided by operating activities was approximately 3.2 million and 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
and 2023, respectively. The increase of approximately 1.0 million is primarily attributable to an increase in earnings and an increase
of approximately 2.7 million related to deferred unearned tuition. 

Investing
activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was approximately 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and approximately 0.2
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 0.1 million. 

Financing
activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was approximately 8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and net cash used
of approximately 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 8.4 million due to the net
proceeds of 7.9 million from our initial public offering IPO ). 

Financings 

From
 July 2021 to September 2021, the Company issued 108,333 shares of common stock to investors at a purchase price of 3.00 per share
 for total proceeds of 325,000. 

From

Impact of Inflation 

We
believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and
2023. There can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 

Segment Information 

We
operate in one reportable segment as a single educational delivery operation using a core infrastructure that serves the curriculum and
educational delivery needs of our institution s students regardless of geography. Our chief operating decision maker, our CEO and
President, manages our operations as a whole, and our chief operating decision maker does not evaluate expenses or operating income information
on a component level. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations
by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under current
GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use
asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2021, using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted
ASU 2016-02 on July 1, 2022. The Company has elected to apply the short-term scope exception for leases with terms of 12 months or less
at the inception of the lease and will continue to recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis. As a result of the adoption, on July
1, 2022, the Company recognized a lease liability of approximately 5.7 million, which represented the present value of the remaining
minimum lease payments using an estimated incremental borrowing rate of 3.98 . As of July 1, 2022, the Company recognized a right-to-use
asset of approximately 5.3 million. Lease expense did not change materially as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-02. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 provides guidance for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on
an estimate of current expected credit losses model. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
Recently, the FASB issued the final ASU to delay adoption for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2022. We adopted ASU 2016-13 on July 1, 2023 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures. 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts
in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity.
This ASU amends the guidance on convertible instruments and the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity s own equity,
and also improves and amends the related earnings per share guidance for both Subtopics. The ASU will be effective for smaller reporting
companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within those annual periods and early adoption
is permitted. We adopted 2020-06 on July 1, 2024 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures.

JOBS Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take
advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those
standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We
have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act.
As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

We
are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS
Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain
of these exemptions, including, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls
over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report
providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will
remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual
gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more, as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the Securities and Exchange Commission
to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers during its most recently completed fiscal year; (ii) the last
day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on
which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed
to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The
Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures 
as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including
its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and recognizes that any control and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance
that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control 

There
have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.
In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may be subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to
any material legal proceedings and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have
a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 as filed with the SEC on October 1, 2024 Annual Report ). There have been
no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report. You should carefully consider the risks
described in our Annual Report which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described
in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the
risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected.

discounts and commissions and offering expenses We also received net proceeds of approximately 1.4 million, which includes 375,000 shares
of common stock issued pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and offering expenses.

None
of the expenses incurred by us were direct or indirect payments to any of (i) our directors or officers or their associates, (ii) persons
owning 10 or more of our common stock, or (iii) our affiliates. Northland Securities, Inc., acted as book-running manager and representative
of the underwriters for the IPO.
