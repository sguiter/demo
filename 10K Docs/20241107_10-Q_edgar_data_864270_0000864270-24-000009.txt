 Credit Quality Indicators 
 Credit losses are an expected cost of extending credit. The majority of our credit risk is with consumer financing and to a lesser extent with dealer financing. Exposure to credit risk in retail loans is managed through regular monitoring and adjusting of underwriting standards, pricing of contracts for expected losses, and focusing collection efforts to minimize losses. Exposure to credit risk for dealers is managed through ongoing review of their financial condition and payment performance. 
 Retail Loan Segment 
 The Company utilizes proprietary credit scoring systems to evaluate the credit risk of applicants and assign internal credit grades at origination. Factors used to develop a customer s credit grade include the terms of the contract, the loan-to-value ratio, the customer s debt ratios, and credit bureau attributes such as the number of trade lines, utilization ratio, and number of credit inquiries. Different scorecards are utilized depending on the type of product financed. The Company regularly reviews and analyzes the performance of the consumer-financing portfolio to ensure the effectiveness of underwriting guidelines, purchasing criteria and scorecard predictability of customers. Internal credit grades are determined only at the time of origination and are not reassessed during the life of the contract. The following describes the internal credit grade ratings.

 Dealer Loan Segment 
 The Company utilizes an internal risk rating system to evaluate dealer credit risk. Dealerships are assigned an internal risk rating based on an assessment of their financial condition and other factors. Factors including liquidity, financial strength, management effectiveness, and operating efficiency are evaluated when assessing their financial condition. Financing limits and interest rates are based upon these risk ratings. Monitoring activities including financial reviews and inventory inspections are performed more frequently for dealerships with weaker risk ratings. The financial conditions of dealerships are reviewed and their risk ratings are updated at least annually.

 Loan Modifications 
 The contractual terms of loans may be modified when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties in an effort to mitigate losses. There were no dealer loans that were modified for dealers experiencing financial difficulties during the six months ended September 30, 2024. Payment deferrals are granted on retail loans, however the delays in payments are considered insignificant since the number of deferred payments are limited and interest continues to accrue during the deferral period. Starting in April 2023, the Company began granting term extensions on retail loans in the United States. Term extensions extend the maturity date of the loan which reduces the monthly payments over the remaining extended term of the loan. Term extensions do not change the contractual interest rates or reduce the outstanding principal balances. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, term extensions were not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements. Retail loans may also be modified in reorganization proceedings pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which may include interest rate adjustments, term extensions, and principal forgiveness. Retail loans modified under bankruptcy protection were not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements during the six months ended September 30, 2024.

 The fair value of derivative instruments is subject to the fluctuations in market interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Since the Company has elected not to apply hedge accounting, the volatility in the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized in earnings. All periodic interest settlements of derivative instruments are presented within cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The final notional exchange of cross currency swaps are presented within cash flows from financing activities along with the paydowns of the related foreign currency denominated debt. 
 These derivative instruments also contain an element of credit risk in the event the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, the Company minimizes the risk exposure by limiting the counterparties to major financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. In the event of default, all counterparties are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements. In Canada, HCFI is a party to reciprocal credit support agreements that require posting of cash collateral to mitigate counterparty credit risk on derivative positions. Posted collateral is recognized in other assets and held collateral is recognized in other liabilities.

 million were deferred during the six months ended September 30, 2024. The Company will continue to evaluate the effects of IRA as additional guidance and regulations are issued. 
 During fiscal years 2024 and 2025, several countries, including Japan and Canada, enacted tax laws to adopt various aspects of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (GloBE Rules). The GloBE Rules are designed to ensure large multinational enterprises (MNEs) pay a minimum level of tax Minimum Tax on income in each of the jurisdictions in which they operate. These rules generally apply to MNE groups with annual revenue of 750 million or more. The Company is in scope of the GloBE Rules, effective as of April 1, 2024, as a result of our affiliation with HMC. On June 20, 2024, Canada, where the Company s Canadian subsidiary HCFI is incorporated, enacted the Global Minimum Tax Act, which implemented the Income Inclusion Rule and Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up tax under the GloBE Rules, effective from April 1, 2024. Since HCFI is expected to have an effective tax rate that exceeds the 15 minimum rate, the Company has no related current tax expense associated with the Minimum Tax as of September 30, 2024. To date, the U.S., where we have operations and conduct business, has not enacted laws to adopt the GloBE Rules. Based on preliminary analysis, we do not expect a material tax impact as a result of the GloBE Rules. The Company will continue to monitor legislative developments and changes in business for potential impacts of the GloBE Rules on future periods. 
 The Company's effective tax rate was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company's effective tax rates for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, differ from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of U.S. state taxes. 
 The Company does not provide for income taxes on its share of the undistributed earnings of HCFI which are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At September 30, 2024, billion of accumulated undistributed earnings of HCFI were intended to be so reinvested. If the undistributed earnings as of September 30, 2024 were to be distributed, the tax liability associated with these earnings would be million, inclusive of currency translation adjustments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company is subject to examination for U.S. federal returns filed for the taxable years ended March 31, 2014 through 2023, and for various U.S. state returns filed for the taxable years ended March 31, 2008 through 2023. The Company s Canadian subsidiary, HCFI, is subject to examination for federal and provincial returns filed for the taxable years ended March 31, 2017 through 2024. The Company believes appropriate provision has been made for all outstanding issues for all open years and does not expect any material changes in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.

 The valuation techniques used in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis are described below: 
 Derivative Instruments 
 The Company s derivatives are transacted in over-the-counter markets and quoted market prices are not readily available. The Company uses third-party developed valuation models to value derivative instruments. These models estimate fair values using discounted cash flow modeling techniques, which utilize the contractual terms of the derivative instruments and market-based inputs, including interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Discount rates incorporate counterparty and HMC specific credit default spreads to reflect nonperformance risk. 
 The Company s derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 since all significant inputs are observable and do not require management judgment. There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on derivative instruments.

 The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used in nonrecurring fair value measurements, which relate to the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting on long-lived assets. 
 Vehicles Held for Disposition 
 Vehicles held for disposition consist of returned and repossessed vehicles. They are valued at the lower of their carrying value or estimated fair value, less estimated disposition costs. The fair value is based on current average selling prices of like vehicles at wholesale used vehicle auctions.

 geographic regions where operating results are measured and evaluated by management: the United States and Canada. 
 Segment performance is evaluated using an internal measurement basis, which differs from the Company s consolidated results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Segment performance is evaluated on a pre-tax basis before the effect of valuation adjustments on derivative instruments and revaluations of foreign currency denominated debt. Since the Company does not elect to apply hedge accounting, the impact to earnings resulting from these valuation adjustments as reported under GAAP is not representative of segment performance as evaluated by management. Realized gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of realized gains and losses on foreign currency denominated debt, are included in the measure of net revenues when evaluating segment performance. 
 No adjustments are made to segment performance to allocate any revenues or expenses. Financing products offered throughout the United States and Canada are substantially similar. Segment revenues from the various financing products are reported on the same basis as GAAP consolidated results.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 Our primary focus, in collaboration with AHM and HCI, is to provide support for the sale of Honda and Acura products and maintain customer and dealer satisfaction and loyalty. To deliver this support effectively, we seek to maintain competitive cost of funds, efficient operations, and effective risk and compliance management. The primary factors influencing our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition include the volume of Honda and Acura sales and the portion of those sales that we finance, our cost of funds, competition from other financial institutions, consumer credit defaults, and used motor vehicle prices. 
 A substantial portion of our consumer financing business is acquired through incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and HCI. The volume of these incentive financing programs and the allocation of those programs between retail loans and leases may vary from fiscal period to fiscal period depending upon the respective marketing strategies of AHM and HCI. AHM and HCI s marketing strategies are based in part on their business planning and control, in which we do not participate. Therefore, we cannot predict the level of incentive financing programs AHM and HCI may sponsor in the future. Our consumer financing acquisition volumes are substantially dependent on the extent to which incentive financing programs are offered. Increases in incentive financing programs generally increase our financing penetration rates, which typically results in increased financing acquisition volumes for us. The amount of subsidy payments we receive from AHM and HCI is dependent on the terms of the incentive financing programs and the interest rate environment. Subsidy payments are received upon acquisition and recognized in revenue throughout the life of the loan or lease; therefore, a significant change in the level of incentive financing programs in a fiscal period typically only has a limited impact on our results of operations for that period. The amount of subsidy income we recognize in a fiscal period is dependent on the cumulative level of subsidized contracts outstanding that were acquired through incentive financing programs. 
 We seek to maintain high quality consumer and dealer account portfolios, which we support with strong underwriting standards, risk-based pricing, and effective collection practices. Our cost of funds is facilitated by the diversity of our funding sources, and effective interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management. We manage expenses to support our profitability, including adjusting staffing needs based upon our business volumes and centralizing certain functions. Additionally, we use risk and compliance management practices to optimize credit and residual value risk levels and maintain compliance with our pricing, underwriting and servicing policies at the United States, Canadian, state and provincial levels. 
 In our business operations, we incur costs related to funding, credit loss, residual value loss, and general and administrative expenses, among other expenses. 
 We analyze our operations in two business segments defined by geography: the United States and Canada. We measure the performance of our United States and Canada segments on a pre-tax basis before the effect of valuation adjustments on derivative instruments and revaluations of foreign currency denominated debt. For additional information regarding our segments, see Note 13 Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) . The following tables and the related discussion are presented based on our geographically segmented consolidated financial statements. 
 References in this report to our fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2024 refer to our fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 and our fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, respectively.

Results of Operations 
 Operating Environment Overview 
 New vehicle production and dealer inventory levels have normalized since the lows we experienced during the first half of fiscal year 2023. Total consumer financing acquisition volumes remained strong with the support of incentive programs and our total outstanding asset balances continued to increase during the first six months of fiscal year 2025. Although benchmark interest rates declined during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, the returns on our assets and effective interest rates on our debt remained higher during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 relative to the comparable period during fiscal 2024. 
 The trend in delinquencies and charge-offs continued to increase which may be attributable to the negative effects of higher monthly loan and lease payments due to higher transaction prices, inflationary pressures, high interest rates, and other factors affecting consumers ability to perform on their obligations. Used vehicle prices have softened but remain relatively strong with return rates on leased vehicles remaining at low levels.

United States Segment 
 Revenues 
 Revenue from retail loans increased due to higher average outstanding balances and higher yields. 
 Revenue from dealer loans increased due to higher average outstanding balances primarily of wholesale flooring loans as a result of higher dealer inventory levels. 
 Operating lease revenue increased due to the increase in average revenue per unit which was partially offset by lower average outstanding units. 
 Leased vehicle expenses 
 Leased vehicle expenses decreased due to lower average outstanding units, which was partially offset by higher average depreciation expense per unit. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased due to higher average outstanding debt and higher average interest rates. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for more information. 
 32 

Realized (gains)/losses on derivatives and foreign currency debt 
 Net realized losses during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 consisted of losses on pay float interest rate swaps of 130 million and losses on cross currency interest rate swaps of 73 million which were partially offset by gains on pay fixed interest rate swaps of 169 million. 
 Provision for credit losses 
 Provision for credit losses increased due to the increase in acquisition of retail loans. The increase was also attributable to the increasing trend of delinquencies and net charge-offs. See Financial Condition Credit Risk below for more information. 
 Early termination loss on operating leases 
 Early termination losses on operating leases increased due to the increases in realized losses, our estimate of early termination losses, and acquisition volumes. See " Financial Condition Credit Risk below for more information. 
 Canada Segment 
 Revenues 
 Revenue from retail loans increased due to higher yields and higher average outstanding balances. 
 Revenue from dealer loans were consistent. 
 Operating lease revenue decreased primarily due to lower average outstanding units and the effect of foreign currency translation adjustments. 
 Leased vehicle expenses 
 Leased vehicle expenses decreased due to lower average outstanding units and the effect of foreign currency translation adjustments. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased due to higher average outstanding debt and higher average interest rates. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for more information. 
 Realized (gains)/losses on derivative instruments 
 Net realized gains on interest rate swaps during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 were attributable to realized gains on pay fixed interest rate swaps of 22 million which were partially offset by realized losses on pay float interest rate swaps of 16 million. 
 Provision for credit losses

 Credit Risk 
 Credit losses are an expected cost of extending credit. The majority of our credit risk is in consumer financing and to a lesser extent in dealer financing. Credit risk of our portfolio of consumer finance receivables can be affected by general economic conditions. Adverse changes, such as a rise in unemployment or an increase in inflationary pressures, can increase the likelihood of defaults. Declines in used vehicle prices can reduce the amount of recoveries on repossessed collateral. We manage our exposure to credit risk in retail loans by monitoring and adjusting our underwriting standards, which affect the level of credit risk that we assume, pricing contracts for expected losses and focusing collection efforts to minimize losses. We manage our exposure to credit risk for dealers through ongoing reviews of their financial condition and payment performance. 
 We are also exposed to credit risk on our portfolio of operating lease assets. We expect a portion of our operating leases to terminate prior to their scheduled maturities when lessees default on their contractual obligations. Losses are generally realized upon the disposition of the repossessed operating lease vehicles. The factors affecting credit risk on our operating leases and our management of the risk are similar to that of our consumer finance receivables. 
 Credit risk on dealer loans is affected primarily by the financial strength of the dealers within the portfolio, the value of collateral securing the financings, and economic and market factors that could affect the creditworthiness of dealers. We manage our exposure to credit risk in dealer financing by performing comprehensive reviews of dealers prior to establishing financing arrangements and monitoring the payment performance and creditworthiness of these dealers on an ongoing basis. In the event of default by a dealer, we seek all available legal remedies pursuant to related dealer agreements, guarantees, security interests on collateral, or liens on dealership assets. Additionally, we have agreements with AHM and HCI that provide for their repurchase of new, unused, undamaged and unregistered vehicles or equipment that have been repossessed from dealers who defaulted under the terms of their respective wholesale flooring agreements. 
 The allowance for credit losses is management s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses on the amortized cost basis of finance receivables. Additional information regarding credit losses is provided in the discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates Allowance for Credit Losses and Estimated Early Termination Losses on Operating Lease Assets below.

The follo wing table presents information with respect to our allowance for credit losses and credit loss experience of our finance receivables and losses related to lessee defaults on our operating leases:

 (1) Ending and average receivable balances exclude the allowance for credit losses, unearned subvention income related to our incentive financing programs and deferred origination costs. Average receivable balances are calculated based on the average of each month s ending receivables balance for that fiscal year. 
 (2) For the purposes of determining whether a contract is delinquent, payment is generally considered to have been made, in the case of (i) dealer loans, upon receipt of 100 of the payment when due and (ii) consumer finance receivables, upon receipt of 90 of the sum of the current monthly payment plus any overdue monthly payments. Delinquent amounts presented are the aggregated principal balances of delinquent finance receivables. Payments that were granted deferrals are not considered delinquent during the deferral period. 
 (3) Percentages for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been annualized. 
 
 41 

In the United States segment, we recognized a provision for credit losses on our finance receivables of 151 million and 143 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in the provision for credit losses was due to higher retail loan acquisitions. Expected credit losses on our retail loans also increased due to the increasing trend of delinquencies and net charge-offs. The increase in net charge-offs was due to the increase in the volume of retail loans with longer terms which typically have higher loan-to-value ratios, and as a result, higher loss severities. We recognized early termination losses on operating leases of 55 million and 40 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and 2024, respectively. Early termination losses on operating leases increased due to the increases in realized losses, our estimate of early termination losses, and acquisition volumes. The increase in operating lease delinquencies and forecasted unemployment rates contributed to the increase in our estimate of early termination losses. 
 In the Canada segment, we recognized a provision for credit losses on our finance receivable of 7 million and 5 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and 2024, respectively. Provision for credit losses increased due to the increase in provision for retail loans as a result of higher expected losses due to an increase in the trend of delinquencies and charge-offs. We recognized early termination losses on operating leases of less than 1 million during both the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2024. 
 Lease Residual Value Risk 
 Contractual residual values of lease vehicles are determined at lease inception based on our expectations of used vehicle values at the end of their lease term. Lease customers have the option at the end of the lease term to return the vehicle to the dealer or to buy the vehicle at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance). Returned lease vehicles can be purchased by the grounding dealer at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance) or a market based price. Returned lease vehicles that are not purchased by the grounding dealers are sold through online and physical auctions. We are exposed to a risk of loss on the disposition of returned lease vehicles if the market values of leased vehicles at the end of their lease terms are less than their contractual residual values. 
 Operating lease vehicles are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to the lower of contract residual values or estimated end of term residual values. Adjustments to estimated end of term residual values are made prospectively on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term. A review for impairment of our operating lease assets is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If impairment conditions are met, impairment losses are measured by the amount carrying values exceed their fair values. We did not recognize impairment losses due to declines in estimated residual values during the first six months of fiscal year 2025. Additional information regarding lease residual values is provided in the discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates Estimated End of Term Residual Values below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity strategy is to fund current and future obligations through our cash flows from operations and our diversified funding programs in a cost and risk effective manner. Our cash flows are generally impacted by cash requirements related to the volume of finance receivable and operating lease acquisitions, various operating and funding costs, and dividend payments, which are largely funded through payments received on our assets and our funding sources outlined below. As noted, the levels of incentive financing sponsored by AHM and HCI can impact our financial results and liquidity from period to period. Increases or decreases in incentive financing programs typically increase or decrease our financing penetration rates, respectively, which result in increased or decreased acquisition volumes and increased or decreased liquidity needs, respectively. At acquisition, we receive the subsidy payments, which reduce the cost of consumer loan and lease contracts acquired, and we recognize such payments as revenue over the term of the loan or lease. 
 In an effort to minimize liquidity risk and interest rate risk and the resulting negative effects on our margins, results of operations and cash flows, our funding strategy incorporates investor diversification and the utilization of multiple funding sources including commercial paper, medium-term notes, bank loans and asset-backed securities. We incorporate a funding strategy that takes into consideration factors such as the interest rate environment, domestic and foreign capital market conditions, maturity profiles, and economic conditions. We believe that our funding sources, combined with cash provided by operating and investing activities, will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our debt service and working capital requirements over the next twelve months.

 (1) Weighted average contractual interest rates for commercial paper are bond equivalent yields. Contractual interest rates approximate effective yields. 
 Commercial Paper 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had commercial paper programs in the United States of 7.0 billion and in Canada of C 2.5 billion 1.8 billion). Interest rates on the commercial paper are fixed at the time of issuance. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated commercial paper month-end outstanding principal balances ranged from 5.1 billion to 6.1 billion.

Bank Loans 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, AHFC did not enter into any new loan agreements. HCFI entered into a new floating rate loan for C 225 million 166 million). As of September 30, 2024, we had bank loans denominated in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars with floating interest rates, in principal amounts ranging from 111 million to 500 million. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining maturities of all bank loans outstanding ranged from 58 days to approximately 5.0 years. The weighted average remaining maturity on all bank loans was 1.8 years as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our bank loans contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations and asset sales, and a financial covenant that requires us to maintain positive consolidated tangible net worth. In addition to other customary events of default, the bank loans include cross-default provisions and provisions for default if HMC does not maintain ownership, whether directly or indirectly, of at least 80 of the outstanding capital stock of AHFC or HCFI, as applicable. All of these covenants and events of default are subject to important limitations and exceptions under the agreements governing the bank loans. As of September 30, 2024, management believes that AHFC and HCFI were in compliance with all covenants contained in our bank loan agreements. 
 Public MTN Program 
 AHFC is a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules and issues Public MTNs pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC. In August 2024, AHFC renewed its Public MTN program by filing a new prospectus supplement with the SEC under which it may issue from time to time up to 45.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Public MTNs, which includes the issuance of foreign currency denominated notes into international markets. The aggregate principal amount of MTNs offered under this program may be increased from time to time. 
 The Public MTNs may have original maturities of 9 months or more from the date of issue, may be interest bearing with either fixed or floating interest rates, or may be discounted notes. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, AHFC issued 3.8 billion of floating rate notes ranging from 12 months to 36 months in both USD and EUR. Additionally, AHFC also issued 3.7 billion of fixed rate notes ranging from 25 months to 7 years in both USD and EUR. The weighted average remaining maturities of all Public MTNs was 2.5 years as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Public MTNs are issued pursuant to an indenture, which requires AHFC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions and restrictions on AHFC s ability to merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of its assets or the assets of its subsidiaries, and includes customary events of default. As of September 30, 2024, management believes that AHFC was in compliance with all covenants under the indenture. 
 The table below presents a summary of outstanding debt issued under our Public MTN Programs by currency:

During the six months ended September 30, 2024, HCFI issued C 500 million 370 million) of fixed rate notes and C 200 million 148 million) of floating rate notes. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining maturities of all of HCFI s Canadian notes outstanding ranged from 235 days to approximately 4.7 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of these notes was 2.7 years as of September 30, 2024. 
 The notes are issued pursuant to the terms of an indenture, which requires HCFI to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions, and includes customary events of default. As of September 30, 2024, management believes that HCFI was in compliance with all covenants contained in the privately placed notes.

Secured Debt 
 Asset-Backed Securities 
 We enter into securitization transactions for funding purposes. Our securitization transactions involve transferring pools of retail loans and operating leases to bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities (SPEs). The SPEs are established to accommodate securitization structures, which have the limited purpose of acquiring assets, issuing asset-backed securities, and making payments on the securities. Assets transferred to SPEs are considered legally isolated from us and the claims of our creditors. We continue to service the retail loans and operating leases transferred to the SPEs. Investors in the notes issued by a SPE only have recourse to the assets of such SPE and do not have recourse to the assets of AHFC, HCFI, or our other subsidiaries or to other SPEs. The assets of SPEs are the only source of funds for repayment on the notes. 
 Our securitizations are structured to provide credit enhancements to investors in the notes issued by the SPEs. Credit enhancements can include the following: 
 Subordinated certificates securities issued by SPEs that are retained by us and are subordinated in priority of payment to the notes. 
 
 Overcollateralization securitized asset balances that exceed the balance of securities issued by SPEs. 
 
 Excess interest excess interest collections to be used to cover losses on defaulted loans. 
 
 Reserve funds restricted cash accounts held by the SPEs to cover shortfalls in payments of interest and principal required to be paid on the notes. 
 
 Yield supplement accounts restricted cash accounts held by SPEs to supplement interest payments on notes. 
 The risk retention regulations in Regulation RR of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), require the sponsor to retain an economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized assets, either directly or through one or more majority-owned affiliates. Standard risk retention options allow the sponsor to retain either an eligible vertical interest, an eligible horizontal residual interest, or a combination of both. AHFC has satisfied this obligation by retaining an eligible vertical interest of an amount equal to at least 5 of the principal amount of each class of note and certificate issued for the securitization transaction that was subject to this rule but may choose to use other structures in the future. 
 We are required to consolidate the SPEs in our financial statements, which results in the securitizations being accounted for as on-balance sheet secured financings. The securitized assets remain on our consolidated balance sheet along with the notes issued by the SPEs. 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we issued notes through asset-backed securitizations totaling 4.4 billion, which were secured by assets with an initial balance of 4.7 billion. There were no outstanding operating lease securitizations as of September 30, 2024. 
 Credit Agreements 
 Syndicated Bank Credit Facilities 
 AHFC maintains a 7.0 billion syndicated bank credit facility that includes a 3.5 billion 364-day credit agreement, which expires on February 21, 2025, a 2.1 billion credit agreement, which expires on February 25, 2026, and a 1.4 billion credit agreement, which expires on February 25, 2028. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts were drawn upon under the AHFC credit agreements. AHFC intends to renew or replace these credit agreements prior to or on their respective expiration dates. 
 HCFI maintains a C 2.0 billion 1.5 billion) syndicated bank credit facility that includes a C 1.0 billion 739 million) credit agreement, which expires on March 25, 2025 and a C 1.0 billion 739 million) credit agreement, which expires March 25, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts were drawn upon under the HCFI credit agreements. HCFI intends to renew or replace the credit agreements prior to or on the expiration dates. 
 46 

The credit agreements contain customary conditions to borrowing and customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens and limitations on mergers, consolidations and asset sales, and limitations on affiliate transactions. The credit agreements also require AHFC and HCFI to maintain a positive consolidated tangible net worth as defined in their respective credit agreements. The credit agreements, in addition to other customary events of default, include cross-default provisions and provisions for default if HMC does not maintain ownership, whether directly or indirectly, of at least 80 of the outstanding capital stock of AHFC or HCFI, as applicable. In addition, the AHFC and HCFI credit agreements contain provisions for default if HMC s obligations under the HMC-AHFC Keep Well Agreement or the HMC-HCFI Keep Well Agreement, as applicable, become invalid, voidable, or unenforceable. All of these conditions, covenants and events of default are subject to important limitations and exceptions under the agreements governing the credit agreements. As of September 30, 2024, management believes that AHFC and HCFI were in compliance with all covenants contained in the respective credit agreements. 
 Other Credit Agreements 
 AHFC maintains other committed lines of credit that allow the Company access to an additional 1.0 billion in unsecured funding with two banks. The credit agreements contain customary covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations and asset sales and a requirement for AHFC to maintain a positive consolidated tangible net worth. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts were drawn upon under these agreements. These agreements expire in September 2025. The Company intends to renew or replace these credit agreements prior to or on their respective expiration dates. 
 Keep Well Agreements 
 HMC has entered into separate Keep Well Agreements with AHFC and HCFI. Pursuant to the Keep Well Agreements, HMC has agreed to, among other things: 
 
 own and hold, at all times, directly or indirectly, at least 80 of each of AHFC s and HCFI s issued and outstanding shares of voting stock and not pledge, directly or indirectly, encumber, or otherwise dispose of any such shares or permit any of HMC s subsidiaries to do so, except to HMC or wholly-owned subsidiaries of HMC; 
 
 cause each of AHFC and HCFI to, on the last day of each of AHFC s and HCFI s respective fiscal years, have a positive consolidated tangible net worth (with tangible net worth meaning (a) shareholders equity less (b) any intangible assets, as determined in accordance with GAAP with respect to AHFC and generally accepted accounting principles in Canada with respect to HCFI); and 
 
 ensure that, at all times, each of AHFC and HCFI has sufficient liquidity and funds to meet their payment obligations under any Debt (with Debt defined as AHFC s or HCFI s debt, as applicable, for borrowed money that HMC has confirmed in writing is covered by the respective Keep Well Agreement) in accordance with the terms of such Debt, or where necessary, HMC will make available to AHFC or HCFI, as applicable, or HMC will procure for AHFC or HCFI, as applicable, sufficient funds to enable AHFC or HCFI, as applicable, to pay its Debt in accordance with its terms. AHFC or HCFI Debt does not include the notes issued by SPEs in connection with AHFC s or HCFI s secured financing transactions, any related party debt or any indebtedness outstanding as of September 30, 2024 under AHFC s and HCFI s bank loan agreements. 
 As consideration for HMC s obligations under the Keep Well Agreements, we have agreed to pay HMC a quarterly fee based on the amount of outstanding Debt pursuant to Support Compensation Agreements, dated April 1, 2019. We incurred expenses of 21 million and 16 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 41 million and 31 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, pursuant to these Support Compensation Agreements. 
 Indebtedness of Consolidated Subsidiaries 
 As of September 30, 2024, AHFC and its consolidated subsidiaries had 65.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities, including current liabilities, of which 17.5 billion consisted of indebtedness and liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries. None of AHFC s consolidated subsidiaries had any outstanding preferred equity.

 _______________________ 
 
 (1) Debt obligations reflect the remaining principal obligations of our outstanding debt and do not reflect unamortized debt discounts and fees. Repayment schedule of secured debt reflects payment performance assumptions on underlying receivables. Foreign currency denominated debt principal is based on exchange rates as of September 30, 2024. 
 (2) Interest payments on floating rate and foreign currency denominated debt based on the applicable floating rates and/or exchange rates as of September 30, 2024. 
 The obligations in the above table do not include certain lending commitments to dealers since the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. Refer to Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these commitments. 
 Our contractual obligations on derivative instruments are also excluded from the table above because our future cash obligations under these contracts are inherently uncertain. We recognize all derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The amounts recognized as fair value do not represent the amounts that will be ultimately paid or received upon settlement under these contracts. Refer to Note 5 Derivative Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivative instruments. 
 
 Derivatives 
 We utilize derivative instruments to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The types of derivative instruments include interest rate swaps, basis swaps, and cross currency swaps. Interest rate and basis swap agreements are used to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations of our floating rate debt relative to our fixed rate finance receivables and operating lease assets. Cross currency swap agreements are used to manage currency and interest rate risk exposure on foreign currency denominated debt. The derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk in the event the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements. 
 All derivative financial instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities, and carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in our consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Since we do not elect to apply hedge accounting, the impact to earnings resulting from these valuation adjustments as reported under GAAP is not representative of our results of operations as evaluated by management. Realized gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of realized gains and losses on foreign currency denominated debt, are included in the measure of net revenues when we evaluate segment performance. Refer to Note 13 Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for additional information about segment information and Note 5 Derivative Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for additional information on derivative instruments. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We are not a party to off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 New Accounting Standards 
 Refer to Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The application of certain accounting policies may require management to make estimates that affect our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates require our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often requiring us to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods, or for which the use of different estimates that could have reasonably been used in the current period would have had a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Retail Loans and Estimated Early Termination Losses on Operating Lease Assets 
 Retail loans are evaluated on a collective basis and grouped into pools with similar risk characteristics such as origination quarter, internal credit grade at origination, product type, and original term. The allowance for retail loans is measured using econometric regression models that correlate vintage age, credit quality, economic, and other variables to historical vintage-level credit loss performance. Statistically relevant economic factors such as unemployment rates, bankruptcies, and used vehicle price indexes are applied in the analysis of the economic environment. Current and forecasted economic conditions are applied in the models to project monthly gross loss rates in terms of origination dollars for the remaining contractual life of each vintage. Recoveries are projected as a percentage of the cumulative forecasted loss dollar of each vintage. The contractual term is the estimated lifetime of retail loans and is considered to be a reasonable and supportable forecast period of future economic conditions. Economic forecasts and macroeconomic variables are obtained from a third party economic research firm that extend through the lifetime of retail loans and converge to long-run equilibrium trends. Baseline forecasts that reflect the most likely economic future is the single economic scenario applied in the models. Qualitative adjustments may also be applied if management believes the quantitative models do not reflect the best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses. Estimated losses on operating leases expected to terminate early due to lessee defaults are also determined collectively using modeling methodologies consistent with those used for retail loans. 
 Sensitivity Analysis 
 We applied the baseline economic scenarios for the United States and Canada that were obtained from a third party economic research firm in our models to determine our allowance for credit losses on retail loans and estimated early termination losses on operating lease assets as of September 30, 2024. These baseline economic scenarios represent forecasts of the most likely economic future, with an equal probability of economic conditions being better or worse than forecasted. Alternative economic scenarios were also obtained from the third party economic research firm. As an example of the sensitivity of our accounting estimates, we applied upside and downside economic scenarios in our models. The peak unemployment rate over the next 24 month period under the upside and downside economic scenarios in the United States was 3.9 and 8.3 , respectively. The resulting allowance for credit losses on retail loans under the upside and downside economic scenarios was 361 million and 584 million, respectively. Similarly, the resulting estimated early termination losses on operating lease assets were 89 million and 133 million, respectively. 
 Estimated End of Term Residual Values 
 Estimated end of term residual values are dependent on the expected market values of leased vehicles at the end of their lease terms and the percentage of leased vehicles expected to be returned by lessees. Factors considered in this evaluation include, among other factors, economic conditions, external market information on new and used vehicles, historical trends, and recent auction values. Estimated return rates are dependent on expected market values of leased vehicles since declines in used vehicle prices generally increase the probability of vehicles being returned to us at the end of their lease terms. We also review our investment in operating leases for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. If impairment conditions are met, impairment losses are measured by the amount the carrying values exceed their fair values. 
 Sensitivity Analysis 
 If future expected end of term market values for all outstanding operating leases as of September 30, 2024 were to decrease by 100 per unit from our current estimates, the total impact would be an increase of approximately 27 million in depreciation expense, which would be recognized over the remaining lease terms. If future return rates for all operating leases were to increase by one percentage point from our current estimates, the total impact would be an increase of approximately 9 million in depreciation expense, which would be recognized over the remaining lease terms. This sensitivity analysis is specific to the conditions in effect as of September 30, 2024 and does not consider the effect declines in estimated end of term market values may have on return rates.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, and each has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Document 
 Exhibit 4.9 

DESCRIPTION OF AHFC S 
 
 600,000,000 Floating Rate Medium-Term Notes, Series A, due May 29, 2026 
 
 The following is a description of American Honda Finance Corporation s 600,000,000 Floating Rate Medium-Term Notes, Series A, due May 29, 2026 (the Notes as provided in our pricing supplement, dated September 24, 2024, and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on September 26, 2024. This description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the description of the general terms and provisions of the debt securities found in our prospectus , dated August 11, 2022 and filed with the SEC on August 11, 2022, and our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, described in the prospectus supplement , dated August 11, 2022 and filed with the SEC on August 11, 2022. The following summary of specified provisions of the Indenture (defined below) and the Notes is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the actual provisions of the Indenture, including the definitions contained in the Indenture of some of the terms used below, and the Notes. A copy of the Indenture has been filed as an exhibit to our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on August 11, 2022 and of which the pricing supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus are a part. 
 
 Unless otherwise indicated by the context, as used herein, AHFC, we, us and our refer solely to American Honda Finance Corporation (excluding its subsidiaries). 
 
 General 
 
 The Notes are a tranche of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A. The Notes were issued under the Indenture dated as of September 5, 2013, between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the Trustee ), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 8, 2018, between AHFC and the Trustee (as so supplemented, the Indenture . The terms of the Notes include those provisions contained in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. 
 
 The Notes were initially limited to an aggregate principal amount of 500,000,000 . See Further Issuances below. The Notes were issued in minimum denominations of 100,000, and integral multiples of 1,000, in excess thereof. 
 
 The Notes are our general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, rank equally with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding and are considered part of the same series of notes as any of our other Medium-Term Notes, Series A, previously issued or issued in the future. The Indenture does not limit the amount of Notes, debentures or other evidence of indebtedness that we may issue under the Indenture or otherwise and provides that debt securities under the Indenture may be issued from time to time in one or more series. 
 
 We have initially designated Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as our paying agent (the Paying Agent ), calculation agent, registrar and transfer agent where Notes may be presented for payment. 
 
 The entire principal amount of the Notes will mature and become payable, together with unpaid interest, if any, accrued thereon on May 29, 2026 (the Stated Maturity Date ), unless redeemed earlier as described below under Redemption for Tax Reasons. The Notes are not subject to any sinking fund provisions and are not convertible into or exchangeable for any of our equity interests . 
 
 The principal of each Note payable at maturity or earlier redemption will be paid in euro against presentation and surrender at the office or agency maintained for such purpose. 
 
 Under the Indenture, holders of the Notes will vote with holders of all other tranches of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, as a single class. 

Exhibit 4.9 

 The Indenture contains provisions that require the consent of or action by a specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, acting as a single class. For example, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, as a single class, may consent to certain modifications or amendments to the Indenture and waiver of certain continuing defaults under the Indenture, as described under Description of Debt Securities Modification, Waivers and Meetings in the prospectus, and holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, as a single class, may declare the principal amount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, to be due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of certain events of default, as described under Description of Debt Securities Events of Default in the prospectus. Therefore, because the Medium-Term Notes, Series A, vote as a single class, a greater percentage of the principal amount of the Notes may be required to take action under the Indenture and the aggregate principal amount of the Notes may not be sufficient to take action under the Indenture in the future. In addition, under the prospectus supplement, we may issue up to 45.0 billion aggregate principal amount (approximately 40.5 billion aggregate principal amount based on the euro U.S. rate of exchange of 1.00 U.S. 1.1111 as of September 23, 2024, as reported by Bloomberg) of Medium-Term Notes, Series A, under the Indenture, of which, as of September 23, 2024, approximately 27.5 billion aggregate principal amount (approximately 24.7 billion aggregate principal amount based on the euro U.S. rate of exchange of 1.00 U.S. 1.1111 as of September 23, 2024, as reported by Bloomberg) of Medium-Term Notes, Series A has previously been issued. We may increase the authorized aggregate principal amount of our Medium-Term Notes, Series A, at any time without your consent.

 Interest payable on an interest payment date will be paid to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on the regular record date provided, however, that interest payable at the Stated Maturity Date or earlier redemption date will be payable to the person to whom principal shall be payable. Save as provided below, the regular record date for the Notes will be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day (as defined below), immediately preceding the related interest payment date provided that, in the case of Notes 

Exhibit 4.9 

 represented by a global note, the regular record date for the Notes will be the clearing system business day (for this purpose a day on which Clearstream and Euroclear are open for business) immediately preceding the related interest payment date. 
 
 If any interest payment date, the Stated Maturity Date or earlier redemption date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as if made on the date the applicable payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such interest payment date, the Stated Maturity Date or such redemption date, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day. For purposes of the Notes, Business Day means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, which is (i) not a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York or London are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close and (ii) a T2 Business Day. 
 
 Issuance of the Notes in Euro 
 
 Initial holders were required to pay for the Notes in euro, and principal, premium, if any, and interest payments in respect of the Notes, including any payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, will be payable in euro. 
 
 If the euro is not available in our good faith judgment for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest with respect to the Notes, including payments of redemption on the Notes, due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of AHFC, or is no longer used by the member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, AHFC will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to holders of the Notes by making that payment in U.S. dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) as computed by the exchange rate agent (appointed by the Company) on the second Business Day before that payment is due, or if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate on or before the date that payment is due or as otherwise determined by AHFC in good faith, if the foregoing is impracticable. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute a default under the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall be responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or otherwise handling redenominations. 
 The Market Exchange Rate means the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of euros as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 In the event that the euro is no longer used by the member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or an official redenomination of the euro, AHFC s obligations with respect to payments on the Notes shall, in each case, be regarded immediately following such redenomination as providing for the payment of that amount of euros representing the amount of such obligations immediately before such redenomination. The Notes do not provide for any adjustment to any amount payable under the Notes as a result of any change in the value of euros relative to any other currency due solely to fluctuations in exchange rates. 
 All determinations referred to above made by the exchange rate agent will be at its sole discretion and will, in the absence of clear error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the holders of the Notes. 
 
 Further Issuances 
 
 We may, from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional notes having the same ranking, interest rate, Stated Maturity Date, redemption provisions and other terms as the Notes, as applicable, except for (1) the original issue date, (2) the issue price and (3) in some cases, the first interest payment date provided, however, such additional notes must be fungible with the previously issued notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Additional notes will be considered part of the same series of notes as the Notes and any of our other Medium-Term Notes, Series A previously issued or issued in the future. We also may, 

Exhibit 4.9 

 from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue additional debt securities, under the Indenture or otherwise, ranking equally with the Notes and our other Medium-Term Notes, Series A.

 We will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest such additional amounts Additional Amounts as are necessary in order that the net amount of such payment of the principal of and interest on a Note to a holder who is a United States Alien (as such term is defined below), after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or governmental charge of the United States (as such term is defined below), or a political subdivision or authority thereof or therein, imposed by withholding with respect to the payment, will not be less than the amount provided for in such Note to be then due and payable.

Prior to the transmission or publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph, we shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate signed by two directors of AHFC stating that we are entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right to so redeem the Notes has occurred.

 Book-Entry Delivery and Settlement 
 
 We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream and Euroclear and their book-entry systems and procedures from sources that we believe to be reliable. We take no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In addition, the description of the clearing systems in this section reflects our understanding of the rules and procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear as they are currently in effect. Those systems could change their rules and procedures at any time. 
 
 Global Clearance and Settlement 
 
 The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more global notes in fully registered form, without coupons, and will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary for, and in respect of interests held through, Euroclear and Clearstream. Except as described herein, certificates will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the global notes. 
 
 Except as set forth below, the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to the common depositary, its successors or their respective nominees. 
 
 Beneficial interests in the global notes will be represented, and transfers of such beneficial interests will be effected, through accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in Euroclear or Clearstream. Those beneficial interests will be in denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. Investors may hold Notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. 

Exhibit 4.9 

 Owners of beneficial interests in the global notes will not be entitled to have Notes registered in their names, and, except as described herein, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Notes in definitive form. So long as the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or such common depositary s nominee is the registered holder of the global notes, the common depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole holder of the Notes represented by the global notes for all purposes under the Indenture and the global notes. Except as provided below, beneficial owners will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes under the Indenture, including for purposes of receiving any reports delivered by us or the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture. Accordingly, each beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of the clearing systems and, if such person is not a participant of the clearing systems, on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the Indenture. Under existing industry practices, if we request any action of holders or a beneficial owner desires to give or take any action which a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, the clearing systems would authorize their participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to give or take action and the participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through the participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners. Conveyance of notices and other communications by the clearing systems to their participants, by the participants to indirect participants and by the participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. These limits and laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in global notes. 
 
 Clearstream 
 
 Clearstream has advised that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and licensed as a bank and professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to its participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with the Euroclear Operator (as defined below) to facilitate the settlement of trades between Clearstream and Euroclear. As a registered bank in Luxembourg, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector. Clearstream customers are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through, or maintain a custodial relationship with, a Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. 
 
 Distributions with respect to Notes held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream participants in accordance with its rules and procedures. 
 
 Euroclear 
 
 Euroclear has advised that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear includes various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank SA NV (the Euroclear Operator ). All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator. Euroclear participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant, either directly or indirectly. 

Exhibit 4.9 

 Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related operating procedures of Euroclear, and applicable Belgian law (collectively, the Terms and Conditions ). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear participants, and has no records of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear participants. 
 
 Distributions with respect to the Notes held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in accordance with the Terms and Conditions. 
 
 Euroclear and Clearstream Arrangements 
 
 So long as the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream or such common depositary s nominee is the registered holder of the global notes, the common depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such global notes for all purposes under the Indenture and the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, in respect of the global notes will be made to the common depositary or such common depositary s nominee, as the case may be, as registered holder thereof. None of us, the Trustee, any agent and any affiliate of any of the above or any person by whom any of the above is controlled (as such term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) will have any responsibility or liability for any records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the global notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. 
 
 Distributions of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the global notes, including any payments made upon any redemption of the global notes, will be credited in euro to the extent received by Euroclear or Clearstream from the Paying Agent to the cash accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream customers in accordance with the relevant system s rules and procedures. 
 
 Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a person having an interest in the global notes to pledge such interest to persons or entities which do not participate in the relevant clearing system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate in respect of such interest. 
 
 Initial Settlement 
 
 We understand that investors that hold their Notes through Clearstream or Euroclear accounts will follow the settlement procedures that are applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. Subject to applicable procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear, Notes will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear participants on the business day following the settlement date, for value on the settlement date. 
 
 Secondary Market Trading 
 
 Because the purchaser determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Notes where both the purchaser s and seller s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date. 
 
 We understand that secondary market trading between Clearstream and or Euroclear participants will occur in the ordinary way following the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. Secondary market trading will be settled using procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. 
 
 You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving the Notes through Clearstream and Euroclear on days when those systems are open for 

Exhibit 4.9 

 business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States. 
 
 In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to make or receive a payment or delivery of the Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether Clearstream or Euroclear is used. 
 
 Clearstream or Euroclear will credit payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as applicable, in accordance with the relevant system s rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Clearstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case may be, will take any other action permitted to be taken by a holder under the Indenture on behalf of a Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures. 
 
 Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the Notes among participants of Clearstream and Euroclear. However, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and they may discontinue those procedures at any time. 

Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes 
 
 Subject to certain conditions, the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimum denominations of 100,000 principal amount and multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof if 
 
 (1) Clearstream, Euroclear or any successor thereto notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to act as a clearing system for the Notes 
 
 (2) we, at our option, notify the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of certificated notes with respect to the Notes or 
 
 (3) there has occurred and is continuing an event of default with respect to the Notes. 
 
 In all cases, definitive notes delivered in exchange for any global note or beneficial interest therein will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the common depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures). 
 
 Payments (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) and transfers with respect to notes in definitive form may be executed at the office or agency maintained for such purpose, at our option, by check mailed to the holders thereof at the respective addresses set forth in the register of holders of the Notes, provided that all payments (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) with respect to notes in definitive form, for which the holders thereof have given wire transfer instructions, will be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer, but payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection with that registration may be required.
