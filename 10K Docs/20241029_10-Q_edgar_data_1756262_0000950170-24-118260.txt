All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, including any acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments, are forward-looking statements. The words believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, expect, should, could, target, predict, seek and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short- and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those referenced in the section titled Risk Factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 
 million as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operations, capital expenditures, and debt service payments for at least the next 12 months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, the Company in the future may need to seek additional funding through equity financings, debt financings or strategic alliances. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company s shareholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding when needed, the Company will be required to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs, product expansion or commercialization efforts, or the Company may be unable to continue operations. The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to companies in the medical device industry and of similar size, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, uncertainty of market acceptance of products, and the need to obtain additional financing to fund operations. Products currently under development will require additional research and development efforts, including additional clinical testing and regulatory approval, prior to commercialization. In addition, the Company is subject to risks and uncertainties related to its aviation transportation services, including, but not limited to, compliance with FAA regulations, pilot availability and operational disruptions. These efforts require additional capital, adequate personnel, infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. The Company s research and development may not be successfully completed, adequate protection for the Company s technology may not be obtained, the Company may not obtain necessary government regulatory approval on its expected timeline or at all, and approved products may not prove commercially viable. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and competition. The Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification ASC and Accounting Standards Update ASU of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

allowance for credit losses. Certain of the components and subassemblies included in the Company s products are obtained from a sole source, a single source or a limited group of suppliers, as are sterilization services. Although the Company seeks to reduce dependence on those limited sources of suppliers, manufacturers and service providers, the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operating results, financial condition and cash flows and damage its customer relationships.

convertible senior notes due 2028 (the "Notes") are carried at the face value less unamortized debt discount and issuance costs on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and the fair value of the Notes is presented at each reporting period for disclosure purposes only (see Note 8). 
 
 million is included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company had spare parts inventory as of December 31, 2023. The Company determines, based on the evidence that exists, whether or not it is appropriate to maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete spare parts inventory. The reserve is based on historical experience related to the disposal of inventory due to damage, physical deterioration, obsolescence, or other causes. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had no allowance for spare parts excess and obsolescence. 
 million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. Realized and unrealized losses totaled million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

, the Company acquired Summit pursuant to the terms of an equity purchase agreement. Summit was a charter flight operator based in Bozeman, Montana. The acquisition enabled TransMedics to add aviation transportation services to its NOP and become a comprehensive national provider of donor organ retrieval and delivery in the United States. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a business under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities were recorded as of the acquisition date, at their respective fair values. The preliminary purchase consideration of million reflected an upfront cash payment of million, net of cash acquired and working capital adjustments. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a final working capital adjustment of million to the purchase price and goodwill, which amount was released to the Company in July 2024. The Company s consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 reflect the final allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities assumed based on fair value as of the date of the acquisition. The Company's estimate of preliminary purchase consideration was subject to change upon finalizing working capital adjustments. The Company s preliminary estimate of the fair value of specifically identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition was subject to change upon finalizing its valuation analysis. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an adjustment to goodwill of million, representing an adjustment to its estimate of the fair value of accounts payable and deferred tax liabilities as of the acquisition date. As of September 30, 2024, the preliminary estimates have been finalized, with no further changes to be recorded to the purchase price or allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities assumed.

Property, plant and equipment consisted primarily of flight school aircraft and construction-in-progress related to a commercial aircraft hangar that Summit was in the process of constructing at the date of acquisition. Flight school aircraft were valued using market comparisons adjusted for aircraft-specific condition. The fair value of construction-in-progress approximated its cost. Intangible assets consisted primarily of a customer relationship asset of million related to flight school revenue and was valued using the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. Significant assumptions and estimates utilized in this model include the revenue growth rate, contract renewal probability and the discount rate. Intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis to selling, general and administrative over their estimated useful lives of years as of the acquisition date. Goodwill was recognized for the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the workforce of the acquired business (which is not eligible for separate recognition as an identifiable intangible asset) and anticipated synergies between Summit s existing business processes and the NOP. Goodwill from the acquisition is included within the Company s one reporting unit and is included in the Company s enterprise-level annual review for impairment. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition is t deductible for tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities relate to the differences between the fair value recognized in purchase accounting and the tax basis of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The net deferred tax liability is a source of income to support the recognition of a portion of existing deferred tax assets. Therefore, the Company recorded a tax benefit of million in 2023 for the release of a portion of its valuation allowance related to the net deferred tax liabilities recorded in purchase accounting.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and related to the Company s acquisition of Summit. The change in goodwill during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is a result of final working capital adjustments to the purchase price of Summit. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. To date, the Company has had impairments to goodwill.

Before , noteholders have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events, including certain corporate events, and during the business days immediately after any consecutive trading days in which the trading price per principal amount of Notes is less than ninety-eight percent of the as converted value. Additionally, the noteholder can convert their Notes during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter), commencing after the calendar quarter ending on but before , provided the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least trading days is greater than or equal to of the conversion price during the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of a calendar quarter. From and after March 1, 2028, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company has the right to elect to settle conversions either in cash, shares or in a combination of cash and shares of its common stock. Prior to June 8, 2026, the Notes will not be redeemable. On or after June 8, 2026, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes (subject to the partial redemption limitation set forth in the Indenture), at its option, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, in interest expense related to the cash coupon of the Notes and amortization of the debt issuance costs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized million and million, respectively, in interest expense related to the cash coupon of the Notes and amortization of the debt issuance costs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effective interest rate on the outstanding Notes was approximately . As of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Notes was million. The fair value was determined based on the quoted price of the last trade of the Notes prior to the end of the reporting period in an inactive market, which is considered as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. A conditional conversion feature of the Notes was triggered on June 30, 2024, as the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock was greater than or equal to of the conversion price of the Notes for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on and including the last trading day of the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and the Notes therefore became convertible at the noteholders election in the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2024. This conditional conversion feature was triggered again on September 30, 2024, and the Notes therefore are convertible at the noteholders election in the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2024. If this condition or another conversion condition is met in the future, the Notes may again become convertible, otherwise the Notes will be convertible at the noteholders election from March 1, 2028 through the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Capped Call Transactions In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the Capped Calls with certain financial institution counterparties (the Option Counterparties ). The Capped Calls are generally intended to reduce or offset the potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of the Notes with such reduction or offset, as the case may be, subject to a cap based on the cap price. For accounting purposes, the Capped Calls are separate transactions, and not part of the terms of the Notes. The Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of million incurred to purchase the Capped Calls was recorded as a reduction to common stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Each of the Capped Calls has an initial strike price of approximately per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes. The Capped Calls have an initial cap price of per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately shares of the Company s common stock, which is the same number of shares of the Company s common stock initially underlying the Notes. The Capped Calls are subject to automatic exercise over a trading day period commencing on , subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of our 2023 Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage medical technology company transforming organ transplant therapy for end-stage organ failure patients across multiple disease states. We developed the OCS to replace a decades-old standard of care that we believe is significantly limiting access to life-saving transplant therapy for hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide. Our innovative OCS technology replicates many aspects of the organ s natural living and functioning environment outside of the human body. As such, the OCS represents a paradigm shift that transforms organ preservation for transplantation from a static state to a dynamic environment that enables new capabilities, including organ optimization and assessment. We have also developed our NOP, an innovative turnkey solution to provide outsourced organ retrieval, OCS organ management and logistics services, to provide transplant programs in the United States with a more efficient process to procure donor organs with the OCS. In 2023, we enhanced our NOP offering with the addition of a logistics team to expand our transportation logistics capabilities. Our logistics services include aviation transportation, ground transportation, and other coordination activity. We believe the use of the OCS combined with the NOP has the potential to significantly increase the number of organ transplants and improve post-transplant outcomes. 
 We designed the OCS to be a platform that allows us to leverage core technologies across products for multiple organs. To date, we have developed three OCS products, one for each of heart, lung and liver transplantations, making the OCS the only FDA approved, portable, multi-organ, warm perfusion technology platform. All three of our products, OCS Heart, OCS Lung and OCS Liver, have received Pre-Market Approval, or PMA, from the FDA for both organs donated after brain death, or DBD organs, and organs donated after circulatory death, or DCD organs. 
 Since our inception, we have focused substantially all of our resources on designing, developing and building our proprietary OCS technology platform and organ-specific OCS products; obtaining clinical evidence for the safety and effectiveness of our OCS products through clinical trials; securing regulatory approval; organizing and staffing our company; planning our business; raising capital; commercializing our products; developing and growing our NOP; developing and expanding our market and distribution chain and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from borrowings under loan agreements, proceeds from the issuance of our 1.50 convertible senior notes due 2028, or the Notes, proceeds from the sale of common stock in our public offerings, and revenue from commercial sales of our OCS products and NOP services and clinical trials. 
 From our inception through December 31, 2023, we incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate revenue sufficient to achieve sustained profitability will depend on the continued growth in customer utilization of our products and services. We generated total revenue of 108.8 million and 319.9 million, and net income of 4.2 million and 28.6 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We generated total revenue of 241.6 million and incurred a net loss of 25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 475.1 million. We expect our operating and capital expenditures will continue to increase as we focus on growing commercial sales of our products in both the United States and select non-U.S. markets, including growing our commercial team, which will pursue increasing commercial sales of our OCS products; growing our NOP, including by maintaining and growing our logistics capabilities, including hiring training and retaining pilots to scale our aviation transportation, to support our NOP and reduce dependence on third party transportation, including by means of the acquisition, maintenance or replacement of fixed-wing aircraft or other acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments; scaling our manufacturing and sterilization operations; developing the next generation OCS; continuing research, development and clinical trial efforts; seeking regulatory clearance for new products and product enhancements, including additional indications or other organs, in both the United States and select non-U.S. markets; and operating as a public company. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, commercialization and regulations of our industry, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on an annual basis. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue sufficient to achieve sustained profitability, we may finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and strategic alliances. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or 
 18 

arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we will have to delay, scale back or discontinue the further development and commercialization efforts of one or more of our products, or may be forced to terminate our operations. 
 In March 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, announced initiatives designed to improve the Organ Procurement and Transplantation network, or OPTN, including its intent to solicit contract proposals to manage the OPTN, which is currently operated by the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, under a contract that expired in March 2024. Additionally, in September 2023, the Securing the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Act was signed into law and expressly authorizes HRSA to award multiple grants, contracts or cooperative agreements to support the operation of the OPTN and specifies that the OPTN shall be operated through awards that are distinct from awards made to support the organization tasked with supporting the networks board of directors. In September 2024, HRSA began awarding contracts aimed at supporting these initiatives. The impact that the HRSA initiatives and the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Act may have on our business, including on our NOP, is uncertain at this time. 
 Economic Impacts 
 Inflation, changes in trade policies, and the imposition of duties and tariffs have and could continue to adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials, the components of our products as well as shipping and transportation costs. For example, the global economy has experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity, other material and labor costs, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, supply chain interruptions, uncertainty about economic stability and record inflation globally. Unfavorable economic conditions have and could continue to result in a variety of risks to our business, including impacts on demand and pricing for our products and pricing and availability of raw materials and components for our products, which could make it difficult to forecast our inventory needs and financial results. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate net product revenue primarily from sales of our single-use, organ-specific disposable sets used on our organ-specific OCS Consoles. To a lesser extent, we also generate product revenue from the sale of OCS Consoles to customers and the implied rental of OCS Consoles loaned to customers at no charge. For each new transplant procedure, customers purchase an additional OCS disposable set for use on the customer s existing organ-specific OCS Console. We also generate service revenue by providing outsourced organ retrieval, OCS organ management and logistics services under our NOP in the United States. With the acquisition of Summit, the purchase of fixed-wing transplant aircraft and the addition of a logistics team, we anticipate increased service revenue from our logistics services. 
 Prior to the acquisition, Summit derived its revenue primarily from charter flight services. To a lesser extent, Summit also derived revenue from providing flight school training, managing aircraft and other related services. As part of the Summit integration, we have transitioned Summit's charter flight and aircraft management customers to third parties. We do not anticipate generating revenue from charter flights or aircraft management and related services. We are continuing to offer flight school training services. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, service revenue of 1.3 million and 3.3 million, respectively, consisting primarily of flight school training revenue is from Summit's legacy operations and is unrelated to the NOP and organ transplant. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, service revenue of 2.4 million, including 1.6 million of charter flight and aircraft management services and 0.8 million of flight school training revenue is from Summit's legacy operations and is unrelated to the NOP and organ transplant. 
 All of our OCS transplant-related revenue has been generated by sales to transplant centers and Organ Procurement Organizations, not-for-profit organizations responsible for recovering organs from deceased donors for transplantation, in the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific, or, in some cases, to distributors selling to transplant centers in select countries. Substantially all of our customer contracts have multiple-performance obligations that contain promises consisting of OCS Perfusion Sets and OCS Solutions and may also contain promises for organ retrieval, OCS organ management or logistics services under our NOP, and an OCS Console, whether sold or loaned to the customer. 
 19 

All of our sales outside of the United States have been commercial sales (unrelated to any clinical trials). Our sales in the EU are dependent on obtaining and maintaining the Conformit Europ ene mark, or CE Mark, certifications for each of our OCS products. As required by Regulation (EU) 2017/745, or the MDR, we received recertification of the CE Mark in September 2022 for each of the OCS Heart and OCS Lung systems, which includes the OCS Console, the OCS disposables, and the OCS solution additives. We also received the recertification of the CE Mark in September 2022 for the OCS Liver Console and disposables. We received the CE Mark for the OCS Liver combined with our solution additives under the MDR in May 2023, with an effective date of April 2023. In addition, we received a Class II Medical Device License from Health Canada for our OCS Liver combined with our solution additives in October 2023 to complement our existing Health Canada licenses for OCS Heart and OCS Lung. 
 We expect that our revenue will increase over the long term as a result of the continued growth of the NOP in the United States. We also expect that our revenue will increase over the long term as a result of anticipated growth in non-U.S. sales if national healthcare systems begin to reimburse transplant centers for the use of the OCS, if transplant centers utilize the OCS in more transplant cases and if more transplant centers adopt the OCS in their programs. 
 Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Cost of net product revenue consists of costs of components of our OCS Consoles and disposable sets, costs of direct materials, labor and the manufacturing overhead that directly supports production and depreciation of OCS Consoles. Included in the cost of OCS disposable sets are the costs of our OCS Lung, OCS Heart and OCS Liver Solutions. Cost of service revenue primarily consists of labor and overhead that directly support organ retrieval and OCS organ management services and transportation and logistics costs, including labor costs for pilots, aircraft depreciation, aircraft costs, fuel, crew travel, maintenance and third-party flight costs and ground transportation that support organ delivery. Cost of service revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes 0.7 million and 2.4 million, respectively, of costs from Summit's legacy operations unrelated to the NOP and organ transplant. Cost of service revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 also includes 2.3 million of costs from Summit's legacy operations unrelated to the NOP and organ transplant. 
 Gross profit is the amount by which revenue exceeds cost of revenue in each reporting period and gross margin is gross profit divided by revenue. Our overall gross margin will be impacted by the relative mix of product and service revenue, as product and service revenue have different margin profiles, and we expect our overall gross margin will decrease as service revenue increases as a proportion of overall revenue in 2024 as compared to 2023. Product and service gross margins are also affected by a variety of factors, primarily production volumes, the cost of components and direct materials, manufacturing overhead costs, direct labor, the cost of services provided under the NOP and the selling price of our OCS products and NOP services. 
 We expect that overall cost of revenue will increase or decrease in absolute dollars primarily as, and to the extent that, our revenue increases or decreases. We expect that the cost of net product revenue as a percentage of net product revenue will moderately decrease and gross margin and gross profit will moderately increase over the long term as our sales and production volumes increase and our cost per unit of our OCS disposable sets decreases due to economies of scale, our product enhancements and improved manufacturing efficiency. We intend to use our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities to further advance and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, which we believe will reduce costs and increase our product gross margin. We also expect to see modest improvements in the future in our services gross margin as we provide more services and the efficiency in provisioning of these services improves due to scale and experience. While we expect our gross margins to increase over the long term, they will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research, Development and Clinical Trials Expenses 
 Research, development and clinical trials expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, product development, hardware and software engineering, clinical trials to continue to develop clinical evidence of our products safety and effectiveness, regulatory expenses, testing, consultant services and other costs associated with our OCS technology platform and OCS products, which include: 
 employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research, hardware and software development, regulatory and clinical trial functions, and recruiting and temporary service fees related to such personnel; 

expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials of our products, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and data management organizations; 

the cost of maintaining and improving our product designs, including the testing of materials and parts used in our products; 

20 

laboratory supplies and research materials; and 

facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance. 

We expense research, development and clinical trials costs as incurred. In the future, we expect that research, development and clinical trials expenses will increase over the long term due to ongoing product development and approval efforts. We expect to continue to perform activities related to obtaining additional regulatory approvals for expanded indications in the United States and other served geographies, as well as developing the next generation of our OCS technology platform. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our commercial team and personnel in executive, marketing, finance and administrative functions, and recruiting and temporary service fees for such personnel. We expect to continue to increase headcount in our commercial team and increase marketing efforts as we continue to grow commercial sales of our OCS products in both U.S. and select non-U.S. markets. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs, costs to support the NOP, promotional activities, marketing, conferences and trade show costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services and amortization of sales and marketing-related intangible assets. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest expense associated with outstanding borrowings under our loan agreement and our Notes as well as the amortization of debt discounts associated with such agreements. In July 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, or CIBC, under which we borrowed 60.0 million. In May 2023, we issued and sold 460.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our Notes. 
 Interest Income and Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest income and other income (expense) includes interest income, realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other non-operating income and expense items unrelated to our core operations. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from intercompany transactions as well as transactions with customers or vendors denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which the transaction is recorded.

We also had service revenue unrelated to OCS transplant of 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted primarily of flight school training revenue from Summit's legacy operations, and service revenue unrelated to OCS transplant of 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, including 1.6 million of charter flight and aircraft management services and 0.8 million of flight school training revenue, from Summit's legacy operations. 
 Revenue from customers in the United States related to OCS transplant was 104.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased by 45.2 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to higher sales volumes of our OCS Liver, OCS Heart and OCS Lung disposable sets and increased usage of the NOP. Revenue for each organ in the table above includes net product revenue from sales of disposable sets as well as service revenue for organ retrieval, OCS organ management and logistics services under the NOP in the United States. Establishing the NOP, which launched in late 2021, has allowed us to broaden our customer base and increase utilization of the OCS in organ transplantation. Substantially all of our customers in the United States now participate in the NOP. By adding logistics to our NOP offering in late 2023, we have been able to further increase product and service revenue. 
 Revenue from customers outside the United States was 2.6 million and 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Cost of net product revenue increased by 2.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of service revenue increased by 20.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as we increased utilization of the NOP. Gross profit increased by 20.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Overall gross margin was 56 and 61 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in gross margin from 2023 to 2024 was driven primarily by the relative increase in service revenue, which has a lower gross margin than product revenue. Gross margin from net product revenue was 80 and 77 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross margin from net product revenue increased from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher volume of product sales. Gross margin from service revenue was 19 and 21 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and consisted primarily of organ retrieval, OCS organ management and logistics services under our NOP. Gross margin from service revenue decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to investments in our NOP network, including aviation-related expenditures, to prepare for future growth.

Personnel related costs included stock-based compensation expense of 1.1 million and 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Consulting and third-party services costs increased by 2.1 million due to development efforts by our external development consultants for our next generation OCS program, other product development and digital tools. 
 Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses

Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 12.0 million from 30.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 42.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to increases in personnel related costs, facility related and other costs and NOP support costs. Personnel related costs increased by 9.1 million primarily due to the continued expansion of our team to support the growth in our business, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense of 2.2 million, due primarily to additional grants to new and existing employees. NOP support costs increased by 1.2 million due primarily to increased utilization of the NOP and our efforts to prepare for further growth. Facility related and other costs increased by 3.5 million due primarily to increased costs associated with post-approval studies as well as information technology infrastructure costs and depreciation and amortization expense due to the growth in our business. These increases were partially offset by decreases in professional and consultant fees and tradeshows and conferences expenses. Professional and consultant fees decreased by 1.5 million due primarily to transaction costs incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 2.0 million related to our Summit acquisition and decreased legal fees, partially offset by increased fees in the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to information technology and other enterprise solutions costs to support the growth in our business. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 3.6 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and consisted of interest expense on the 460.0 million principal amount of the Notes that carry a 1.5 interest rate and interest expense on the 60.0 million principal amount of the CIBC loan that carries a variable interest rate, which was 7.2 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Income and Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest income and other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included interest income of 3.3 million and 5.2 million, respectively, from interest earned on cash balances. Other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 also included 0.7 million of realized and unrealized foreign currency transactions gains and 0.2 million of realized and unrealized foreign currency transactions losses, respectively.

We also had service revenue unrelated to OCS transplant of 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted primarily of flight school training revenue from Summit's legacy operations and service revenue unrelated to OCS transplant of 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, including 1.6 million of charter flight and aircraft management services and 0.8 million of flight school training revenue, from Summit's legacy operations. 
 Revenue from customers in the United States related to OCS transplant was 305.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and increased by 159.1 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to higher sales volumes of our OCS Liver, OCS Heart and OCS Lung disposable sets and increased usage of the NOP. Revenue for each organ in the table above includes net product revenue from sales of disposable sets as well as service revenue for organ retrieval, OCS organ management and logistics services under the NOP in the United States. Establishing the NOP, which launched in late 2021, has allowed us to broaden our customer base and increase utilization of the OCS in organ transplantation. Substantially all of our customers in the United States now participate in the NOP. By adding logistics to our NOP offering in late 2023, we have been able to further increase product and service revenue. 
 Revenue from customers outside the United States was 11.4 million and 11.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Cost of service revenue increased by 60.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as we increased utilization of the NOP. Gross profit increased by 83.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Overall gross margin was 59 and 66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in gross margin from 2023 to 2024 was driven primarily by the relative increase in service revenue, which has a lower gross margin than product revenue. Gross margin from net product revenue was 79 and 78 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross margin from service revenue was 27 and 25 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and consisted primarily of organ retrieval, OCS organ management and logistics services under our NOP. The increase in gross margin from services was due primarily to improved efficiency in our NOP service model as a result of the addition of our logistics offering and increased scale.

 From our inception through December 31, 2023, we incurred significant operating losses. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from borrowings under loan agreements, proceeds from the issuance of our Notes, proceeds from the sale of common stock in our public offerings and revenue from commercial sales of our OCS products and NOP services and clinical trials. On May 11, 2023, we issued 460.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The total net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, after deducting debt issuance costs of 14.6 million, and purchases of Capped Calls of 52.1 million, were 393.3 million. At September 30, 2024, our principal source of liquidity was cash of 330.1 million.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities of 399.5 million consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of our Notes of 445.4 million, partially offset by payments of 52.1 million for associated capped calls, proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options of 5.2 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan of 1.0 million.

Convertible Senior Notes 
 On May 11, 2023, we issued 460.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, pursuant to an indenture dated May 11, 2023, by and between us and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, or the Indenture. 
 The initial conversion price of the Notes is approximately 94.00 per share of common stock, which represents a premium of approximately 32.5 over the closing price of our common stock on May 8, 2023. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2028, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. We used 52.1 million of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes to fund the cost of entering into capped call transactions, described below. The proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately 393.3 million, net of capped call transaction costs of 52.1 million and initial purchaser discounts and other debt issuance costs totaling 14.6 million. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.50 per year and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The initial conversion rate is 10.6388 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately 94.00 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events as described in the Indenture. 
 Before March 1, 2028, noteholders have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events, including certain corporate events, and during the five business days immediately after any ten consecutive trading days in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of Notes is less than ninety-eight percent (98 of the as converted value. Additionally, the noteholder can convert their Notes during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter), commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2023 but before March 1, 2028, provided the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of a calendar quarter. From and after March 1, 2028, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. We have the right to elect to settle conversions either in cash, shares or in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. 
 Prior to June 8, 2026, the Notes will not be redeemable. On or after June 8, 2026, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes (subject to the partial redemption limitation set forth in the Indenture), at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130 of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. 
 A conditional conversion feature of the Notes was triggered on June 30, 2024, as the last reported sale price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price of the Notes for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including the last trading day of the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and the Notes therefore became convertible at the noteholders election in the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2024. This conditional conversion feature was triggered again on September 30, 2024, and the Notes therefore are convertible at the noteholders election in the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2024. If this condition or another conversion condition is met in the future, the Notes may again become convertible, otherwise the Notes will be convertible at the noteholders election from March 1, 2028 through the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 In July 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with CIBC as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of May 8, 2023, by and among the Company and CIBC, or the First Amendment, the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of June 23, 2023, by and among the Company and CIBC, or the Second Amendment, and the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of November 9, 2023, by and among the Company and CIBC, or the Third Amendment, pursuant to which we borrowed 60.0 million, referred to herein as the CIBC Credit Agreement. 
 Borrowings under the CIBC Credit Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to either, at our option, (i) the secured overnight financing rate for an interest period selected by us, subject to a minimum of 1.50 , plus 2.0 or (ii) 1.0 plus the higher of a) the prime rate, subject to a minimum of 4.0 or b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate, plus 0.5 . At our option, we may prepay borrowings outstanding under the CIBC Credit Agreement, subject to a prepayment fee of 1.0 if paid after 12 months but prior to 24 months after the closing date. All obligations under the CIBC Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and each of our material subsidiaries. 
 All obligations of us and each guarantor are secured by substantially all of our and each guarantor s assets, including their intellectual property, subject to certain exceptions. Under the CIBC Credit Agreement, we have agreed to customary 
 29 

representations and warranties, events of default and certain affirmative and negative covenants to which we will remain subject until maturity. The financial covenants include, among other covenants, (x) a requirement to maintain a minimum liquidity amount of the greater of either (i) the consolidated adjusted EBITDA loss (or gain), as defined, for the trailing four month period (only if EBITDA is negative) and (ii) 10.0 million, and (y) a requirement to maintain total net revenue of at least 75 of the level set forth in the total revenue plan presented to CIBC. The obligations under the CIBC Credit Agreement are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified events of default, including payment default, change in control, bankruptcy, insolvency, certain defaults under other material debt, certain events with respect to governmental approvals (if such events could cause a material adverse change in our business), failure to comply with certain covenants and a material adverse change in our business, operations or financial condition. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the CIBC Credit Agreement. During the continuance of an event of default, the interest rate per annum will be equal to the rate that would have otherwise been applicable at the time of the event of default plus 2.0 . If an event of default (other than certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency) occurs and is continuing, CIBC may declare all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest to be due and payable. Upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all of the outstanding principal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest will automatically become due and payable. In addition, we may be required to prepay outstanding borrowings, subject to certain exceptions, with portions of net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and certain casualty and condemnation events. 
 Funding Requirements 
 As we continue to pursue and increase commercial sales of our OCS products, we expect our costs and expenses to increase in the future, particularly as we expand our commercial team, grow our NOP, scale our manufacturing and sterilization operations, continue research, development and clinical trial efforts, seek regulatory approval for new products and product enhancements, including new indications, both in the United States and in select non-U.S. markets, and seek greater control of air and ground transport for our NOP. For example, if the demand for our products exceeds our existing manufacturing and sterilization capacity, our ability to fulfill orders would be limited until we have sufficiently expanded such operations. The timing and amount of our operating and capital expenditures will depend on many factors, including: 
 the amount of product revenue generated by sales of our OCS Consoles, OCS disposable sets and other products that may be approved in the United States and select non-U.S. markets, revenue generated by our services, and growth of the NOP; 

the costs and expenses of expanding our U.S. and non-U.S. sales and marketing infrastructure and our manufacturing operations; 

the extent to which our OCS products are adopted by the transplant community; 

the ability of our customers to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed using the OCS products; 

the degree of success we experience in commercializing our OCS products for additional indications; 

the costs, timing and outcomes of post-approval studies or any future clinical studies and regulatory reviews, including to seek and obtain approvals for new indications for our OCS products; 

the emergence of competing or complementary technologies or procedures; 

the number and types of future products we develop and commercialize; 

the cost of development of the next generation OCS; 

the costs associated with maintaining and improving our commercial operations, including the NOP; 

the costs associated with maintaining and growing our logistics capabilities, including by means of attracting, training and retaining pilots, and the acquisition, maintenance, or replacement of fixed-wing aircraft for our aviation transportation services or other acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and 

the level of our selling, general and administrative expenses. 

We believe that our existing cash will enable us to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements, and debt service payments for at least 12 months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 30 

We may need to raise additional funding, which might not be available on favorable terms or at all. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Material Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no material changes to our cash requirements from those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through variable rate debt instruments and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies. Changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flow and earnings. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities. There has been no material change in the foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risk discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
