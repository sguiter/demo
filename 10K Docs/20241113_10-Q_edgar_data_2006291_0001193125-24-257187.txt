Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of private placement Units (the Private Placement Units to the Sponsor at a price of per Unit, or in the aggregate, which is described in Note 4. 
 Transaction costs amounted to , consisting of of upfront discount to the underwriters, of deferred underwriting fees, and of other offering costs, offset by a reimbursement from the underwriters of . 
 The Trust Account 

Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, on May 6, 2024, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units was placed in the trust account (the Trust Account). The proceeds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of one hundred eighty-five (185) days or less or in money market funds that meet certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest only in direct U.S. government obligations and may at any time be held as cash or cash items, including in demand deposit accounts at a bank. Funds will remain in the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Initial Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account proceeds as described below. The remaining proceeds outside the Trust Account may be used to pay for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. 

The Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, other than the permitted withdrawals (as defined below), if any, none of the funds held in the Trust Account will be released until the earlier of (i) the completion of the Initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares that have been properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) in a manner that would affect the substance or timing of its obligation to redeem 100 of the Public Shares if it does not complete an Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if the Company has executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of the Public Shares or pre-Initial
 Business Combination activity; and (iii) the redemption of 100 of the Public Shares if the Company is unable to complete an Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (subject to the requirements of law) (or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if the Company has executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an Initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering). The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company s public shareholders. 
 Initial Business Combination 

The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, although substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering are intended to be generally applied toward consummating an Initial Business Combination. The Initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the Initial Business Combination. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect an Initial Business Combination. 
 The Company, after signing a definitive agreement for an Initial Business Combination, will either (i) seek shareholder approval of the Initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose in connection with which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the Initial Business Combination, for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of amounts withdrawn to fund the working capital requirements, subject to an annual limit of , and to pay taxes permitted withdrawals )), (ii) provide shareholders with the opportunity to sell their Public Shares to the Company by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount in cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest less permitted withdrawals. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of the Initial Business Combination or will allow shareholders to sell their Public Shares in a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require the Company to seek shareholder approval, unless a vote is required by law or under Nasdaq rules. 
 Pursuant to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association if the Company is unable to complete the Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if the Company has executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned (which interest shall be net of permitted withdrawals and up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the holders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. The Sponsor, officers and directors are not entitled to rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares (as defined below) held by them if the Company fails to complete the Initial Business Combination within 24 months of the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or 27 months from the closing of the Public Offering if the Company has executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering). However, if the Sponsor and management team acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial P
ublic Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete the Initial Business Combination within the prescribed time period. 

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company after an Initial Business Combination, the Company s shareholder is entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each class of shares, if any, having preference over the ordinary shares. The Company s shareholder has no preemptive or other subscription rights. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the ordinary shares, except that the Company will provide its shareholder with the opportunity to redeem its Public Shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, upon the completion of the Initial Business Combination, subject to the limitations described herein. 
 On July 27, 2024, the Company s board of directors appointed William Sherman as a director and as a member of the audit committee and the compensation committee of the board of directors, effective as of July 30, 2024. 
 Risks and Uncertainties 

The United States and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the geopolitical instability resulting from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. In response to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO deployed additional military forces to eastern Europe, and the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various sanctions and restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system. Certain countries, including the United States, have also provided and may continue to provide military aid or other assistance to Ukraine and to Israel, increasing geopolitical tensions among a number of nations. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East and the resulting measures that have been taken, and could be taken in the future, by NATO, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Israel and its neighboring states and other countries have created global security concerns that could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. Although the length and impact of the ongoing conflicts are highly unpredictable, they could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions and increased cyber-attacks against U.S. companies. Additionally, any resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets. 
 Any of the above-mentioned factors, or any other negative impact on the global economy, capital markets or other geopolitical conditions resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East and subsequent sanctions or related actions, could adversely affect the Company s search for an Initial Business Combination and any target business with which the Company may ultimately consummate an Initial Business Combination. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had of cash and a working capital surplus of . 
 In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU )2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has sufficient funds for the working capital needs of the Company until a minimum of one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements. The Company cannot assure that its plans to consummate an Initial Business Combination will be successful. 
 We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth
 due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination.

The Sponsor had agreed to forfeit up to an aggregate of Founder Shares to the extent that the over-allotment option is not exercised in full by the underwriters so that the Founder Shares will represent of the Company s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations References in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report to we, us or the Company refer to Churchill Capital Corp IX. References to our management or our management team refer to our officers and directors, and references to the Sponsor refer to Churchill Sponsor IX LLC, an affiliate of M. Klein and Company, LLC. The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report including, without limitation, statements under this Item regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of Management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this Quarterly Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report under Item 1. Financial Statements Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on December 18, 2023, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses that we have not yet identified. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. On January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted new rules and regulations for special purpose acquisition companies SPACs ), which will become effective on July 1, 2024 (the 2024 SPAC Rules ). The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other matters, (i) additional disclosures relating to SPAC Business Combination transactions; (ii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and Business Combination transactions; (iii) additional disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed Business Combination transactions; and (iv) the requirement that both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants for Business Combination registration statements. In addition, the SEC s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto. Recent Developments On July 27, 2024, the Company s board of directors (the Board of appointed William Sherman as a director and as a member of the audit committee and the compensation committee of the Board, effective as of July 30, 2024. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from December 18, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 3,562,356, which includes 3,820,235 of interest income earned on Trust Account, interest income earned on Trust, offset by 257,879 of general and administrative costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 5,500,991, which includes 6,081,124 of interest income earned on Trust Account, interest income earned on Trust, offset by 580,133 of general and administrative costs. Factors That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations Our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. Liquidity and Capital Resources Until the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our only source of liquidity was an initial purchase of shares of Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, by the Sponsor and loans from the Sponsor.

Table of Contents 

On May 6, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 28,750,000 Units, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,750,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 287,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 725,000 Private Placement Units to the Sponsor at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 7,250,000. Following the Initial Public Offering and the private placement, a total of 287,500,000 10.00 per Unit) was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred transaction costs of 14,560,986 consisting of 5,750,000 of upfront discount to the underwriters, 10,062,500 of deferred underwriting fees, and 557,236 of other offering costs, offset by reimbursement from the underwriters of 1,808,750. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less permitted withdrawals and deferred underwriting discounts and commissions), to complete our initial Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination, and to pay for directors and officers liability insurance premiums. In order to finance working capital deficit or to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. If the Company completes its initial Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to 1,500,000 of the Working Capital Loans may be convertible into units of the post Business Combination entity at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units and the underlying securities would be identical to the Private Placement Units. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has sufficient funds for the working capital needs of the Company until a minimum of one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements. The Company cannot assure that its plans to consummate an Initial Business Combination will be successful. We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.

Contractual obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an aggregate of 30,000 per month to the Sponsor or an affiliate thereof for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative support. We will begin incurring these fees on May 2, 2024 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. The underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting commission of 3.5 on the Units sold or 10,062,500 in the aggregate, of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account upon the completion of our initial Business Combination subject to the terms of the underwriting commission. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgement. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, actual results could materially differ from those estimates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any critical accounting estimates to be disclosed. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Table of Contents 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter of 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings None. Item 1A. Risk Factors As a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Quarterly Report. For additional risks relating to our operations, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our final prospectus for the Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC on May 3, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our final prospectus for the Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC, except we may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. On May 6, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 28,750,000 Units, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,750,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 287,500,000. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, and one-quarter of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Each warrant will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination and will expire five years after the completion of the initial Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 725,000 Private Placement Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit in a private placement. Each Unit consists of one Public Share and one-quarter of one Private Warrant. Each Private Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per shares, subject to adjustments. We incurred transaction costs amounting to 14,560,986 consisting of 5,750,000 of upfront discount to the underwriters, 10,062,500 of deferred underwriting fees, and 557,236 of other offering costs, offset by reimbursement from the underwriters of 1,808,750. After deducting the underwriting fees (excluding the deferred portion of 10,062,500, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial Business Combination, if consummated) and the offering expenses, the total net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was 290,251,514 of which 287,500,000 was placed in the Trust Account. For a description of the use of the proceeds generated in the Initial Public Offering, see Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report. Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures None. Item 5. Other Information None.
