Discussion and Analysis are not historical facts, including statements about strategies and expectations with respect to new and existing
products, market demand, acceptance of new and existing products, marketing efforts, technologies and opportunities, market and industry
segment growth, and return on investments in products and markets. These statements are forward looking statements within the meaning

Discussion and Analysis are based on information available to us on the date of this document, and we assume no obligation to update such
forward looking statements. Readers of this Form 10-Q are strongly encouraged to review the section entitled Risk Factors 
 in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. 

General 

Encision Inc., a medical device company based in Boulder,
Colorado, has developed and markets innovative technology that provides unprecedented outcomes and patient safety in minimally-invasive
surgery. Approximately one in every three surgeons may have a patient injury each year from preventable stray energy burns. We
believe that the patented Active Electrode Monitoring AEM AEM EndoShield Burn Protection System is changing
the marketplace for electrosurgical devices and laparoscopic instruments by providing a solution to a well-documented hazard unique to
laparoscopic surgery. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has published its Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program. The
program has begun to levy as much as a 1 penalty on Medicare reimbursements to hospitals in the lower quadrant of performance for selected
quality indicators, including accidental puncture and laceration APL ). Examples of APL include the use of a cautery device
(electrosurgery) or scissors to dissect a tissue plane that errantly causes an injury to underlying bowels. 

We address market opportunities created by the increase
in minimally-invasive surgery MIS and surgeons use of electrosurgery devices in these procedures. The product
opportunity exists in that monopolar electrosurgery instruments used in laparoscopic procedures provide excellent clinical results, but
are also susceptible to causing inadvertent collateral tissue damage outside the surgeon s field of view due to insulation failure
and capacitive coupling. The risk of unintended electrosurgical burn injury to the patient in laparoscopic surgery has been well documented.
This risk poses a threat to patient safety, including the risk of death, and creates liability exposure for surgeons and hospitals, as
well as increased and preventable readmissions. 

The patented AEM technology provides surgeons with the desired tissue effects, while capturing
stray electrosurgical energy that can cause unintended and unseen tissue injury that may result in death. AEM Surgical Instruments are
equivalent to conventional instruments in size, shape, ergonomics, functionality and competitive pricing, but they incorporate Active
Electrode Monitoring technology to dynamically and continuously monitor the flow of electrosurgical current, thereby preventing
patient injury from stray energy burns. With the shielded and monitored instruments, surgeons can perform electrosurgical
procedures more safely, effectively and economically than is possible using conventional instruments or alternative energy sources. 

The AEM system consists of shielded 5mm AEM Instruments
and an AEM monitor. The AEM Instruments are designed to function identically to the conventional 5mm instruments that surgeons are familiar
with, but with the added benefit of enhanced patient safety. The entire line of laparoscopic instruments has the integrated AEM design
and includes the full range of instruments that are common in laparoscopic surgery today. The AEM monitor is compatible with most electrosurgical
generators and can also be adapted for use in robotic systems. AEM Surgical Instruments provide enhanced patient safety, require no change
in surgeon technique and are cost competitive. Thus, conversion to AEM Surgical Instruments is easy and economical. 

AEM technology has been recommended and endorsed by
many groups involved in MIS. Surgeons, nurses, biomedical engineers, the medicolegal community, malpractice insurance carriers and electrosurgical
device manufacturers advocate the use of AEM technology. We have focused our marketing strategies to date on expanding the market awareness
of the AEM technology and our broad independent endorsements and have continued efforts to improve and expand the AEM technology penetration. 

10 

When a hospital or surgery center changes to AEM technology,
we receive recurring revenue from sales of replacement instruments. We believe that there is no directly competing technology to supplant
AEM products. The replacement market of reusable and disposable AEM products in hospitals and surgery centers that use our AEM technology
represented over 90 of our product revenue during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. This revenue stream is expected
to grow as the base of accounts using AEM technology expands. In addition, we intend to further develop disposable versions of more of
our AEM products in order to meet market demands and expand our sales opportunities. 

We have an accumulated deficit of 22,693,269 at September
30, 2024. A significant portion of our operating funds have been provided by issuances of our common stock and warrants and the exercise
of stock options to purchase our common stock, loans, and (in some periods) by operating profits. Should our liquidity be diminished in
the future because of operating losses, we may be required to seek additional capital. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we
generated 192,699 of cash in our operating activities and used 42,559 for investments in property and equipment. At September 30, 2024,
we had 230,014 in cash and at March 31, 2024 we had 42,509 in cash available to fund future operations, an increase of 187,505 from
March 31, 2024. The increase to cash was principally the result of cash generated by operating activities and borrowing from our line
of credit. Our working capital was 1,142,362 at September 30, 2024 compared to 1,206,252 at March 31, 2024. 

Historical Perspective 

We were organized
in 1991 and spent several years developing the AEM monitoring system and protective sheaths to adapt to conventional electrosurgical instruments.
We have invested heavily in an effort to protect our valuable technology, and, as a result of this effort, we have been issued 16 unexpired
relevant patents that together form a significant intellectual property position. Our patents relate to the basic shielding and monitoring
technologies that we incorporate into our AEM products. 

Our AEM Surgical
Instruments have been engineered to provide a seamless transition for surgeons switching from conventional laparoscopic instruments. AEM
technology has been integrated into instruments that have the same look, feel and functionality as conventional instruments that surgeons
have been using for years. The AEM product line encompasses the full range of instrument sizes, types and styles favored by surgeons.
Additionally, we continue to improve quality and add to the product line. These additions include more disposable versions, the introduction
of hand-activated instruments, our enhanced scissors, our eEdge scissors, our EM3 AEM Monitor, our AEM EndoShield Burn Protection
System and the recent introduction of our AEM 2X enTouch Scissors. Hospitals can make a complete and smooth conversion to our product
line, thereby advancing patient safety in MIS with optimal convenience. 

Outlook 

Installed Base of AEM Monitoring Equipment :
We believe that sales of our installed base of AEM products will increase as the inherent risks associated with monopolar laparoscopic
electrosurgery become more widely acknowledged and as we focus on increasing our sales efficiency and continue to enhance our product
line. We expect that the replacement sales of electrosurgical instruments and accessories will also increase as additional facilities
adopt AEM technology. We anticipate that the efforts to improve the productivity of sales representatives carrying the AEM product line,
along with the introduction of next generation products, may provide the basis for increased sales and profitable operations. However,
these measures, or any others that we may adopt, may not result in either increased sales or profitable operations. 

We believe that the unique performance of the AEM
technology and our breadth of independent endorsements provide an opportunity for continued market share growth. In our view, market awareness
and awareness of the clinical credibility of the AEM technology, as well as awareness of our endorsements, are improving, and we expect
this awareness to benefit our sales efforts for the remainder of fiscal year 2025. Our objectives for the remainder of fiscal year 2025
are to optimize sales execution, to expand market awareness of the AEM technology and to maximize the number of additional hospital and
surgery center accounts switching to AEM instruments while retaining existing customers. In addition, acceptance of AEM products depends
on surgeons preference for our instruments, which depends on factors such as ergonomics, quality and ease of use in addition to
the technological and safety advantages of AEM products. If surgeons prefer other instruments to our instruments, our business results
will suffer. 

Possibility of Operating Losses : We have an
accumulated deficit of 22,693,269 at September 30, 2024. A significant portion of our operating funds have been provided by issuances
of our common stock and warrants and the exercise of stock options to purchase our common stock, loans, and (in some periods) by operating
profits. Should our liquidity be diminished in the future because of operating losses, we may be required to seek additional capital.
We have made strides toward improving our operating results but due to the ongoing need to develop, optimize and train our direct sales
managers and the independent sales representative network, the need to support the development of refinements to our product line, and
the need to increase sustained sales to a level adequate to cover fixed and variable operating costs, we may operate at a net loss. Sustained
losses, or our inability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our obligations, may result in a need to raise additional
capital. 

11 

Revenue Growth : We expect to generate increased
product revenue in the U.S. from sales to new customers and from expanded sales to existing customers as the medical device industry stabilizes
and our network of direct and independent sales representatives becomes more efficient. We believe that the visibility and credibility
of the independent clinical endorsements for AEM technology will contribute to new accounts and increased product revenue in fiscal year
2025 . We also expect to increase market share through promotional programs of placing our
AEM monitors at no charge into hospitals that commit to standardize with AEM instruments. However, all of these efforts to increase market
share and grow product revenue will depend in part on our ability to expand the efficiency and effective coverage range of our direct
and independent sales representatives, as well as maintain and in some cases, improve the quality of our product offerings. The omission
or delay of elective surgeries would negatively impact the extent and timing of revenue growth. Service revenue represents design, development
and product supply revenue from our agreements with strategic partners. 

We also have longer-term initiatives in place to improve
our prospects. We expect that development of next generation versions of our AEM products will better position our products in the marketplace
and improve our retention rate at hospitals and surgery centers that have changed to AEM technology, enabling us to grow our sales. We
are exploring overseas markets to assess opportunities for sales growth internationally. Finally, we intend to explore opportunities
to capitalize on our proven AEM technology via licensing arrangements and strategic alliances. These efforts to generate additional sales
and further the market penetration of our products are longer term in nature and may not materialize. Even if we are able to successfully
develop next generation products or identify potential international markets or strategic partners, we may not be able to capitalize on
these opportunities. 

Gross Profit and Gross Margins : Gross profit
and gross margins can be expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of product sales mix, sales volume and service revenue.
Gross margins on products manufactured or assembled by us are expected to improve at higher levels of production and sales. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses : We continue to
refine our domestic and international distribution capability, and we believe that sales and marketing
expenses will decrease as a percentage of net sales with increasing sales volume. 

Research and Development Expenses : Research
and development expenses are expected to increase to support quality improvement efforts and development of refinements to our AEM product
line and new products, which will further expand options for surgeons and hospitals. 

Results of Operations 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 

Net Product
revenue. Net product revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 1,653,820 compared to 1,752,413 for the quarter ended
September 30, 2023, a decrease of 6 . The decrease in net product revenue is primarily due to a reduction in the sales of disposable products,
which suggests a decrease in the number of procedures performed during this perod. This reduction in procedural volume has, in turn, lowered
the overall demand for our products. 

 Net
Service revenue. Net service revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 101,568 compared to 73,978 for the quarter ended
September 30, 2023. Increase was because of services performed under a Master Services Agreement with Vicarious Surgical Inc.

profit . Gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 of 828,482 represented a decrease of 4 from gross profit of 862,609
for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit decreased because of a non-cash cost increase of 81,603 to inventory reserves
for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Gross profit on product net revenue as a percentage of sales (gross margin) was 47 for the
quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. If the cost increase to inventory reserve were excluded, then gross profit on net revenue
would have been 52 . 

 Sales and marketing expenses . Sales and marketing
expenses of 458,480 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 represented an increase of 18 from sales and marketing expenses of 389,342
for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was because of trade shows and commissions. 

12 

General and administrative expenses . General
and administrative expenses of 373,405 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 represented an increase of 2 from general and administrative
expenses of 366,377 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.This increase was because of
additional staffing needs. 

Research and development expenses . Research
and development expenses of 155,515 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 represented
an increase of 54 compared to 100,854 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was because of an increase of allocated
resources for product development. 

Net loss. Net loss was 170,262 for the quarter
ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss of 7,529 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase to net loss was primarily
because of the increase to inventory reserves and an increase to operating expenses. 

For the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the six months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net Product
revenue. Net product revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,245,779 compared to 3,365,965 for the six months
ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4 . The decrease of net product revenue is attributable to decreased demand for our products. 

Net Service
revenue. Net service revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 140,539 compared to 113,809 for the six months ended
September 30, 2023. Net service revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was for engineering services performed under a Master
Services Agreement with Vicarious Surgical Inc.

52 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 50 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit on net revenue increased
because of higher operating efficiencies. 

 Sales and marketing expenses . Sales and marketing
expenses of 881,716 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 represented an increase of 7 from sales and marketing expenses of 822,778
for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was the result of higher commissions. 

General and administrative expenses . General
and administrative expenses of 725,310 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 represented a decrease of 4 from general and administrative
expenses of 755,133 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was because
of decreased bad debt expense and outside accountants cost. 

Research and development expenses . Research
and development expenses of 294,695 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 represented
an increase of 9 compared to 269,274 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was the result of an increase to allocations.

ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for all or any part of the balance of the fiscal
year. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

To date, a significant portion of our operating funds
have been provided by issuances of our common stock and warrants, the exercise of stock options to purchase our common stock, loans, and
(in some periods) by operating profits. Common stock and additional paid in capital totaled 24,395,358 from inception through September
30, 2024. 

On August 4, 2020, we received 150,000 in loan funding
from the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan EIDL program administered
by the SBA, which program was expanded pursuant to the CARES Act. The EIDL is evidenced by a promissory note, dated August 1, 2021 in
the original principal amount of 150,000 with the SBA, the lender. Under the terms of the Note, interest accrues on the outstanding principal
at the rate of 3.75 per annum. The term of the Note is thirty years, though it may be payable sooner upon an event of default under the
Note. 

During January
2023, we entered into a note agreement with U.S. Bank for 92,000. The note is for five years at a 5 interest rate and the proceeds were
used to purchase equipment. The note is secured by the equipment. 

13 

During September 2023, we entered into a note agreement
with U.S. Bank for 115,004. The note is for five years at a 6 interest rate and the proceeds were used to purchase equipment. The note
is secured by the equipment. 

On November 15, 2023, we entered into a loan and security
agreement with Pathward, N.A. (formerly Crestmark Bank). The loan is due on demand and has no financial covenants. Under the agreement,
we were provided with a line of credit that is not to exceed the lesser of 1,000,000 or 85 of eligible accounts receivable. The interest
rate is prime rate plus 0.5 , with a floor of 6.75 , plus a monthly maintenance fee of 0.4 , based on the average monthly loan balance.
Interest is charged on a minimum loan balance of 300,000, a loan fee of 0.5 at closing and annually, and an exit fee of 3 , 2 and 1 
during years one, two and three respectively. 

Our operations generated 192,699 of cash during the
six months ended September 30, 2024 on net revenue of 3,386,318. The amounts of cash generated by operations for the six months ended
September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the expected amounts of cash to be generated from or used in operations in fiscal
year 2025. At September 30, 2024, we had 230,014 in cash available to fund future operations and a line of credit for up to 921,149,
restricted by eligible account receivables. Our working capital was 1,142,362 at September 30, 2024 compared to 1,206,252 at March 31,
2024. Current liabilities were 1,140,082 at September 30, 2024 compared to 1,220,022 at March 31, 2024. We have a noncancelable lease
agreement for our facilities at 6797 Winchester Circle, Boulder, Colorado. The lease expires October 31, 2026. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842) ASU 2016-02 ), which modified lease accounting for both lessees and lessors to increase transparency
and comparability by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous
accounting standards and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The primary impact for us was the balance sheet recognition
of right-of-use ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases as a lessee. 

Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities
are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. ROU assets also
include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives
received. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities
as our leases do not provide an implicit rate. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

of September 30, 2024 is as follows:

Our fiscal year 2025 operating plan is focused on
increasing new accounts, retaining existing customers, growing revenue, increasing gross profits and conserving cash. We are investing
in research and development efforts to develop next generation versions of the AEM product line. We have invested in manufacturing property
and equipment to manufacture disposable scissors inserts internally and to reduce our cost of product revenue. We cannot predict with
certainty the expected revenue, gross profit, net income or loss and usage of cash for fiscal year 2024. If we are unable to manage our
business operations in line with budget expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business viability, financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. 

Income Taxes 

As of March 31, 2024, net operating
loss carryforwards totaling approximately 8.9 million are available to reduce taxable income in the future. The net operating loss carryforwards
expire, if not previously utilized, at various dates beginning in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. We have not paid income taxes
since our inception. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and other income tax regulations contain provisions which may limit the net operating
loss carryforwards available to be used in any given year if certain events occur, including changes in ownership interests. We have established
a valuation allowance for the entire amount of our deferred tax asset since inception due to our history of losses. Should we achieve
sufficient, sustained income in the future, we may conclude that some or all of the valuation allowance should be reversed. If some or
all of the valuation allowance were reversed, then, to the extent of the reversal, a tax benefit would be recognized which would result
in an increase to net income. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires
us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories,
sales returns, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used
in the preparation of our financial statements. 

15 

We record revenue at a single point in time, when
control is transferred to the customer, which is consistent with past practice. We will continue to apply our current business processes,
policies, systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure. Our shipping policy is FOB Shipping Point. We recognize revenue
from sales to stocking distributors when there is no right of return, other than for normal warranty claims. We have no ongoing obligations
related to product sales, except for normal warranty obligations. We evaluated the requirement to disaggregate revenue, and concluded
that substantially all of our revenue comes from multiple products within a line of medical devices. Our engineering service contracts
are billed on a time and materials basis and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. We record deferred revenue
when funds are received prior to the recognition of the associated revenue. We record a contract liability to deferred revenue which
includes customer prepayments and is included in other accrued liabilities. 

We provide for
the estimated cost of product warranties at the time sales are recognized. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes,
including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we have experienced some costs related to warranties.
The warranty accrual is based on historical experience and is adjusted based on current experience. Should actual warranty experience
differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. 

We reduce inventory
for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value
based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Any write-downs of inventory would reduce our reported net income during
the period in which such write-downs were applied. To the extent that our estimates prove to be too high, and we ultimately utilize or
sell inventory previously determined to be impaired, we may record a reversal of the provision in the period of such determination. 

We recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future income tax consequences, based on enacted tax laws, of temporary differences between the financial reporting and
tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are then reduced, if deemed necessary, by a valuation allowance for the amount
of any tax benefits, which, more likely than not based on current circumstances, are not expected to be realized. Should we maintain sufficient,
sustained income in the future, we may conclude that all or some of the valuation allowance should be reversed. 

Property and
equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation computed over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally five to seven years.
We use the straight-line method of depreciation for property and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter
of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and major additions,
replacements and improvements are capitalized. 

We amortize our
patent costs over their estimated useful lives, which is typically the remaining statutory life. From time to time, we may be required
to adjust these useful lives of our patents based on advances in technology, competitor actions, and the like. We review the recorded
amounts of patents at each period end to determine if their carrying amount is still recoverable based on our expectations regarding sales
of related products. Such an assessment, in the future, may result in a conclusion that the assets are impaired, with a corresponding
charge against earnings. 

We currently
estimate forfeitures for stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options at 40 and evaluate the forfeiture rate quarterly.
Other assumptions that are used in calculating stock-based compensation expense include risk-free interest rate, expected life, expected
volatility and expected dividend. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

ITEM 4. C ontrols
and procedures 

Management s Evaluation of Disclosures Controls
and Procedures 

Our management, comprised of our Chief Executive Officer
(CEO) and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer (PFAO) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Based on that evaluation, and taking the matters described below into account, the Company s
CEO and PFAO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting were not effective during reporting period
ended September 30, 2024. 

Remediation Activities Regarding Material Weakness 

As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the March 31, 2024 fiscal year, management determined that (i) we had a material weakness over our entity level control environment as
of March 31, 2024 and (ii) our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2024. 

Management has been actively engaged in remediating
the above described material weaknesses. The following remedial actions have been taken: 

We have made changes in our policy regarding how contract revenue and related
costs are booked. Under the revised policy, such revenue and costs are now booked in the same month as the related work is performed. 

We have changed our policy regarding reserves for slow moving inventory.
Under our revised, policy we now book additional inventory reserves for all inventory older than 18 months, even if management believes
such inventory is still salable. 

While progress has been made to enhance our internal
control over financial reporting, we are still in the process of implementing these processes, procedures and controls. Additional time
is required to complete implementation and to assess and ensure the sustainability of these procedures. We believe the above actions will
be effective in remediating the material weaknesses described above and we will continue to devote significant time and attention to these
remedial efforts. However, the material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for
a sufficient period of time and management has concluded that these controls are operating effectively. 

Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Other than the applicable remediation efforts described
above, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

17 

PART II. 

Item 1. 
 Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may become involved in legal
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently aware of any such proceedings or claims that we believe
will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A. 
 Risk Factors 

In addition to the information set forth in this Form
10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. There have been no material changes to our risk factors from those included
