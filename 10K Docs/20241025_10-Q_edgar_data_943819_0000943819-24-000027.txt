 operating segments, which are the Sleep and Breathing Health segment and the Residential Care Software segment. 
 We evaluate the performance of our segments based on net revenues and income from operations. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Segment net revenues and segment income from operations do not include inter-segment profits and revenue is allocated to a geographic area based on where the products are shipped to or where the services are performed. 
 Certain items are maintained at the corporate level and are not allocated to the segments. The non-allocated items include corporate headquarters costs, stock-based compensation, amortization expense from acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses, field safety notification expenses, acquisition related expenses, net interest expense (income), gains and losses attributable to equity method investments, gains and losses on equity investments, and other, net. We neither discretely allocate assets to our operating segments, nor does our Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluate the operating segments using discrete asset information. 
 Effective in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we updated the method of attribution of certain costs that are principally managed at the segment level as part of our evaluation of segment operating performance. As a result, certain costs relating to quality and regulatory assurance, commercial legal, operations, sales and marketing, customer service, information technology, and other administrative costs, which were previously included in Corporate costs within our reconciliation of segment operating profit to income before income taxes, are now reported in segment operating results. The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding reporting change for all periods presented.

 Credit Facility 
 On June 29, 2022, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement ), as borrower, with lenders MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger, sole book runner, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer, Westpac Banking Corporation, as syndication agent and joint lead arranger, HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as syndication agent and joint lead arranger, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as documentation agent. The Revolving Credit Agreement, among other things, provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional amount equal to the greater of million or times the EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for the trailing twelve-month measurement period. The Revolving Credit Agreement amends and restates that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2018, among ResMed, MUFG Union Bank, N.A., Westpac Banking Corporation and the lenders party thereto. 
 Additionally, on June 29, 2022, ResMed Pty Limited entered into a Second Amendment to the Syndicated Facility Agreement and First Amendment to Unconditional Guaranty Agreement (the Term Credit Agreement ), as borrower, with lenders MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner, and Westpac Banking Corporation, as syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner, which amends that certain Syndicated Facility Agreement dated as of April 17, 2018. The Term Credit Agreement, among other things, provides ResMed Pty Limited a senior unsecured term credit facility of million. 
 Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries, and ResMed Pty Limited s obligations under the Term Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement contain customary covenants, including, in each case, a financial covenant that requires that we maintain a maximum leverage ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement, as applicable). The entire principal amounts of the revolving credit facility and term credit facility, and, in each case, any accrued but unpaid interest may be declared immediately due and payable if an event of default occurs, as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement, as applicable. Events of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement include, in each case, failure to make payments when due, the occurrence of a default in the performance of any covenants in the respective agreements or related documents, or certain changes of control of us, or the respective guarantors of the obligations borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement. 
 The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each terminate on June 29, 2027, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. Amounts borrowed under the Term Credit Agreement will also amortize on a semi-annual basis, with a million principal payment required on each such semi-annual amortization date. The outstanding principal amounts will bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus to (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) or the Base Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement, as applicable) plus to (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). At September 30, 2024, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amounts was . An applicable commitment fee of to (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio)

 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility. 
 We are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value, even though these instruments are not recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. As the Revolving Credit and Term Credit Agreements interest rate is calculated as Adjusted Term SOFR plus the spreads described above, its carrying amount is equivalent to its fair value as at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, which was million and million, respectively. 
 Senior Notes 
 On July 10, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of million principal amount of our senior notes due July 10, 2026, and million principal amount of our senior notes due July 10, 2029 (collectively referred to as the Senior Notes ). Our obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement and the Senior Notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries. The net proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down borrowings on our Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 Under the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed to customary covenants including with respect to our corporate existence, transactions with affiliates, and mergers and other extraordinary transactions. We also agreed that, subject to limited exceptions, we will maintain a ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) of no more than to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and will not at any time permit the amount of all priority secured and unsecured debt of us and our subsidiaries to exceed of our consolidated tangible assets, determined as of the end of our most recently ended fiscal quarter. This ratio is calculated at the end of each reporting period for which the Note Purchase Agreement requires us to deliver financial statements, using the results of the 12 consecutive month period ending with such reporting period. 
 We are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value, even though these instruments are not recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Senior Notes had a carrying amount of million, excluding deferred borrowing costs, and an estimated fair value of million and million, respectively. Quoted market prices in active markets for similar liabilities based inputs (Level 2) were used to estimate fair value.

 Cleveland Medical patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 10,076,269; 10,426,399; 10,925,535; 11,064,937; 10,028,698; 11,202,603; and 11,234,637. We moved to dismiss the action because Cleveland Medical sued the wrong ResMed entity, and to dismiss the indirect and willful infringement allegations by Cleveland Medical. On October 2, 2023, the court granted a portion of the motion, dismissing all Cleveland Medical claims for indirect and willful infringement, and denied the rest of the motion. On March 22, 2023, ResMed Corp. filed a petition with the PTAB seeking review of the validity of U.S. Patent No. 10,076,269. On May 6, 2024, the PTAB granted the petition and instituted an Inter Partes Review proceeding against the patent. On June 21, 2024, the District Court of Delaware granted ResMed's motion to stay the case until the PTAB issues its final written decision in the Inter Partes Review proceeding. The PTAB decision is expected by May 6, 2025. 
 On March 20, 2023, ResMed Corp. filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, case no. 23-cv-00500-TWR-JLB, seeking a declaration that it does not infringe U.S. Patent No. 11,602,284 issued to Cleveland Medical. In November 2023, the case was transferred to the Northern District of Ohio for the convenience of the parties. Cleveland Medical answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim asserting that ResMed Corp. infringes additional Cleveland Medical patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 11,375,921; 11,690,512; and 11,786,680. On April 9, 2024, Cleveland Medical filed a second amended answer and counterclaims accusing ResMed Corp. of infringing U.S. Patent Nos. 11,857,333 and 11,872,029. ResMed Corp. filed a petition with the PTAB for post-grant review of the validity of U.S. Patent No. 11,602,284, which the PTAB denied on June 24, 2024. On October 17, 2024, the PTAB denied ResMed Corp. s request for rehearing of its decision to deny the petition for post-grant review of U.S. Patent No. 11,602,284. 
 Based on currently available information, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of loss or range of losses, if any, arising from matters that remain open. 
 Contingent Obligations Under Recourse Provisions 
 We use independent financing institutions to offer some of our customers financing for the purchase of some of our products. Under these arrangements, if the customer qualifies under the financing institutions credit criteria and finances the transaction, the customers repay the financing institution on a fixed payment plan. For some of these arrangements, the customer s receivable balance is with limited recourse whereby we are responsible for repaying the financing company should the customer default. We record a contingent provision, which is estimated based on historical default rates. This is applied to receivables sold with recourse and is recorded in accrued expenses. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, receivables sold with limited recourse were million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum exposure on outstanding receivables sold with recourse and the associated contingent provision were million and million, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, the maximum exposure on outstanding receivables sold with recourse and contingent provision were million and million, respectively.

 Non-Designated Hedges 
 We transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian and Singapore dollars. We have foreign currency exposure through both our Australian and Singapore manufacturing activities, and international sales operations. We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased foreign currency call options, collars and forward contracts to hedge foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities and manufacturing cash flows. The terms of such foreign currency hedging contracts generally do not exceed . The purpose of this hedging program is to economically manage the financial impact of foreign currency exposures denominated mainly in Euros, and Australian and Singapore dollars. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated financial assets, liabilities, and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments. We do not designate these foreign currency contracts as hedges. All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency instruments are recorded within other, net in our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 The notional value of the outstanding non-designated hedges was million and million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. These contracts mature at various dates prior to September 15, 2025.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Overview 
 The following is an overview of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations MD A is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report. 
 We are a global leader in the development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloud-based software applications that diagnose, treat and manage respiratory disorders, including sleep disordered breathing SDB ), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. SDB includes obstructive sleep apnea and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. Our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings. Our digital cloud-based health software applications, along with our devices, are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers. 
 Since the development of continuous positive airway pressure therapy, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, and cloud-based software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes. Our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion, our research and product development efforts, acquisitions and an increasing awareness of SDB and respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as significant health concerns. 
 During fiscal year 2024, we announced a new operating model to accelerate long-term growth. The new operating model introduces dedicated leadership in Product, Revenue, and Marketing to the global executive team. This change aims to increase the velocity of product development and sharpen our customer and brand focus. Ultimately, the goal is to accelerate profitable growth, while driving greater value and improved care throughout the outside hospital care continuum and the patient journey. 
 We are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 79.5 million on research and development activities, which represents 6.5 of net revenues, with a continued focus on the development and commercialization of new, innovative products and solutions that improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers and help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and lower healthcare costs. For example, our newest device, AirSense 11, introduced new features such as a touch screen, algorithms for patients new to therapy, digital enhancements, and over-the-air update capabilities. Through our acquisitions of Brightree in 2016, HEALTHCAREfirst and MatrixCare in 2018, and MEDIFOX DAN in 2022, our operations include residential software platforms designed to support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. These platforms comprise our Residential Care Software business and, along with our cloud-based remote monitoring and therapy management system, and a robust product pipeline, these products should continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth. 
 We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry Sleep and Breathing Health and the supply of business management software as a service to out-of-hospital health providers Residential Care Software ). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we renamed our operating segments from Sleep and Respiratory Care to Sleep and Breathing Health and from Software as a Service to Residential Care Software in alignment with our 2030 strategy. There have been no changes in the preparation and disclosure of financial information by operating segment. 
 Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.2 billion, an increase of 11 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was 58.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 54.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Diluted earnings per share was 2.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to diluted earnings per share of 1.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 426.4 million, our total assets were 7.2 billion and our stockholders equity was 5.2 billion.

 The constant currency increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 79.5 million from 75.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.8 million, or 5 . Research and development expenses were unfavorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which increased our expenses by approximately 0.6 million, as reported in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 4 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 6.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The constant currency increase in research and development expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs. 
 
 Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 11.4 million compared to 12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Total Other Income (Loss), Net 
 The following table summarizes our other income (loss) (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Interest (expense) income, net (1,661) (14,957) 13,296 Gain (loss) attributable to equity method investments 963 (3,895) 4,858 Gain (loss) on equity investments (680) (602) (78) Other, net (2,437) 2,648 (5,085) Total other income (loss), net (3,815) (16,806) 12,991 
 
 Total other income (loss), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a loss of 3.8 million compared to a loss of 16.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense, net, decreased to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower debt levels following repayments on our revolving credit facility. In addition, we recorded gains attributable to equity method investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 1.0 million compared to losses of 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Decreases in interest expense, net, and losses attributable to equity method investments were partially offset by foreign exchange net losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 2.4 million compared to foreign exchange net gains of 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 18.8 , as compared to 19.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective rate of 18.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to research credits and foreign operations. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a shift in our global mix of earnings. 
 Our Singapore operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through June 30, 2030. As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable during the year ended June 30, 2018. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax, if repatriated.

 The Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Inclusive Framework) has put forth two proposals Pillar One and Pillar Two that (i) revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and (ii) ensure a minimal level of taxation, respectively. Effective in our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, various jurisdictions in which we operate began implementing the global minimum tax prescribed under Pillar Two. These changes in legislation are not expected to have a material impact on our income tax expense and cash flows for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impacts of the Inclusive Framework for the current fiscal year and future periods. 
 
 Net Income and Earnings per Share 
 As a result of the factors above, our net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 311.4 million compared to 219.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 91.9 million, or 42 . 
 Our diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.11 per diluted share compared to 1.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 42 . 
 
 Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, in evaluating the performance of our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide investors better insight when evaluating our performance from core operations and can provide more consistent financial reporting across periods. For these reasons, we use non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 The measure non-GAAP cost of sales is equal to GAAP cost of sales less amortization of acquired intangible assets relating to cost of sales and field safety notification expenses. The Astral field safety notification expenses relate to estimated costs associated with the replacement of a certain component in some of our Astral ventilation devices that were manufactured between 2013 to 2019. The measure non-GAAP gross profit is the difference between GAAP net revenue and non-GAAP cost of sales, and non-GAAP gross margin is the ratio of non-GAAP gross profit to GAAP net revenue. 
 These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below (in thousands, except percentages): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 GAAP Net revenue 1,224,509 1,102,321 GAAP Cost of sales 507,290 502,261 Less: Amortization of acquired intangibles

 The measure non-GAAP income from operations is equal to GAAP income from operations once adjusted for amortization of acquired intangibles, field safety notification expenses, and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP income from operations is reconciled with GAAP income from operations below (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 GAAP income from operations 387,312 288,997 Amortization of acquired intangibles - cost of sales 7,670 8,908 Amortization of acquired intangibles - operating expenses 11,404 12,479 Astral field safety notification expenses 7,911 Acquisition-related expenses 483 Non-GAAP income from operations 406,386 318,778 
 The measure non-GAAP net income is equal to GAAP net income once adjusted for amortization of acquired intangibles, field safety notification expenses, acquisition related expenses, and associated tax effects. The measure non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is the ratio of non-GAAP net income to diluted shares outstanding. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below (in thousands, except for per share amounts): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 GAAP net income 311,355 219,422 Amortization of acquired intangibles - cost of sales 7,670 8,908 Amortization of acquired intangibles - operating expenses 11,404 12,479 Astral field safety notification expenses 7,911 Acquisition related expenses 483 Income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments (5,071) (8,019) Non-GAAP net income 325,358 241,184 Diluted shares outstanding 147,599 147,486 GAAP diluted earnings per share 2.11 1.49 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share 2.20 1.64 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and access to our revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development activities, selling and marketing activities, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments, dividend payments, share repurchases and repayment of debt obligations. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of several factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, which include impacts from supply chain disruptions, working capital requirements and capital deployment decisions. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate in net revenue, third-party reimbursement of our products for our customers, the timing and extent of spending to support research development efforts, the expansion of selling, general and administrative activities, the timing of introductions of new products, and the expenditures associated with possible future acquisitions, investments or other business combination transactions. As we assess inorganic growth strategies, we may need to supplement our internally generated cash flow with outside sources. If we are required to access the debt market, we believe that we will be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our current level of earnings and cash flow generation as well as our ability to access the market considering those earning levels. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 426.4 million and 238.4 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents held within the United States at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were 136.4 million and 51.2 million, respectively. Our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at September 30, 2024

 and June 30, 2024, were 290.0 million and 187.2 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions . 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,500.0 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility and a combined total of 1,926.4 million in cash and available liquidity under the revolving credit facility. 
 As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable, which resulted in additional tax expense of 126.9 million which was payable over the proceeding eight years. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax if repatriated. 
 We believe that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations, including expected capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond.

 On June 29, 2022, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the Revolving Credit Agreement ). The Revolving Credit Agreement, among other things, provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of 1,500.0 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional amount equal to the greater of 1,000.0 million or 1.00 times the EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month measurement period. Additionally, on June 29, 2022, ResMed Pty Limited entered into a Second Amendment to the Syndicated Facility Agreement (the Term Credit Agreement ). The Term Credit Agreement, among other things, provides ResMed Pty Limited a senior unsecured term credit facility of 200.0 million. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each terminate on June 29, 2027, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,500.0 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility. 
 On July 10, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of 250.0 million principal amount of our 3.24 senior notes due July 10, 2026, and 250.0 million principal amount of our 3.45 senior notes due July 10, 2029 Senior Notes ). 
 On September 30, 2024, there was a total of 680.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes and we were in compliance with our debt covenants. We expect to satisfy all of our liquidity and long-term debt requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt facilities.

 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities was 150.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used of 151.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We repurchased 50.0 million of treasury stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to no purchases during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cash outflows for treasury stock repurchases were offset by lower payments on our Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 Dividends 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we paid cash dividends of 0.53 per common share totaling 77.9 million. On October 24, 2024, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0.53 per common share, to be paid on December 12, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 7, 2024. Future dividends are subject to approval by our board of directors. 
 
 Common Stock 
 On February 21, 2014, our board of directors approved our current share repurchase program, authorizing us to acquire up to an aggregate of 20.0 million shares of our common stock. Since approval of the share repurchase program in 2014 through September 30, 2024, we have repurchased a total of 8.2 million shares under this repurchase program for an aggregate of 612.7 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 221,996 shares at a cost of 50.0 million. Shares that are repurchased are classified as treasury stock pending future use and reduce the number of shares of common stock outstanding used in calculating earnings (loss) per share. The share repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time at the discretion of our board of directors. At September 30, 2024, 11.8 million additional shares remain available for us to repurchase under the approved share repurchase program. 
 
 Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty obligations, goodwill, potentially impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies. 
 We state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 For a full discussion of our critical accounting policies, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Foreign Currency Market Risk 
 Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, although the financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies. We transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian and Singapore dollars. We have significant foreign currency exposure through our Australian and Singapore manufacturing activities and our international sales operations. 
 Net Investment and Fair Value Hedging 
 On November 17, 2022, we executed foreign cross-currency swaps as net investment hedges and fair value hedges in designated hedging relationships with either the foreign denominated net asset balances or the foreign denominated intercompany loan as the hedged items. All derivatives are recorded at fair value as either an asset or liability. Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the hedged item. 
 The purpose of the cross-currency swaps for the fair value hedge is to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated intercompany debt between USD and EUR. For these hedges, we excluded certain components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness that are not related to spot rates. For fair value hedges that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in the same line item as the hedged item, Other, net, in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in the statement of operations under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and is presented in interest (expense) income, net. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the amounts recognized in earnings is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. 
 The purpose of the cross-currency swaps for the net investment hedge is to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on the net asset balances of our foreign functional subsidiaries. For net investment hedges that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in cumulative translation adjustment within other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. The initial fair value of components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness will be recognized in interest (expense) income, net. 
 The notional value of outstanding foreign cross-currency swaps was 1,068.2 million and 1,026.2 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. These contracts mature at various dates prior to December 31, 2029. 
 Non-Designated Hedges 
 We transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian and Singapore dollars. We have foreign currency exposure through both our Australian and Singapore manufacturing activities, and international sales operations. We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased foreign currency call options, collars and forward contracts to hedge foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities and manufacturing cash flows. The terms of such foreign currency hedging contracts generally do not exceed three years. The purpose of this hedging program is to economically manage the financial impact of foreign currency exposures denominated mainly in Euros, and Australian and Singapore dollars. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated financial assets, liabilities, and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments. We do not designate these foreign currency contracts as hedges. All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency instruments are recorded within other, net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 The notional value of the outstanding non-designated hedges was 1,073.9 million and 1,340.0 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. These contracts mature at various dates prior to September 15, 2025.

 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents and debt. At September 30, 2024, we held cash and cash equivalents of 426.4 million, principally comprised of bank term deposits and at-call accounts, and are invested at both short-term fixed interest rates and variable interest rates. At September 30, 2024, there was 180.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement, which are subject to variable interest rates. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, would not have had a material impact on pretax income. We have no interest rate hedging agreements. 
 Inflation 
 Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our products, freight, overhead costs or wage rates may adversely affect our operating results. Sustained inflationary pressures in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue if we are unable to offset such higher costs through price increases.

 Item 4 Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports made pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In no event shall the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate or any director, officer, or employee of the Company (other than the Director) be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty incurred by any Director or beneficiary as a result of the Program s failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, or as a result of the Program s failure to satisfy any other requirements of applicable tax laws. 

Section 4.2 Program Accounts Dividend Equivalent Rights 
 
 Deferred RSUs in respect of each applicable calendar year will be separately designated and tracked under the Program on behalf of each Director. In this regard, the Company will create and maintain on its books a Program account for each Director who has made an election to defer settlement of RSUs under Section 2.1. Following the vesting of the deferred RSUs, the Company will credit to such Program account a number of deferred RSUs corresponding to the number of RSUs the Director has elected to defer. 
 
 Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a Director who has deferred RSUs under the Program shall have a right to Dividend Equivalents equal to the value of any dividends paid on shares of Company common stock for which the record date occurs during the period commencing on the date the deferred RSUs vest and ending on the date the deferred RSUs are settled pursuant to Section 2.2. The Dividend Equivalents entitle the Director to a cash payment equal to the dividends that the Director would have received had the shares of Company common stock underlying the Director s deferred RSUs been held by the Director during such period. Such Dividend Equivalent will be treated separately from the deferred RSUs and will be paid in cash to the Director as soon as reasonably practicable after the date the Company distributes the corresponding dividend to the holders of shares of common stock and in any event within the same calendar year as the year in which such dividend is distributed. 
 
 Section 4.3 Unsecured General Creditor 
 
 The Company s obligations under the Program constitute an unfunded and unsecured promise to distribute shares of Common Stock and or cash in the future. Directors and beneficiaries rights under the Program are solely those of general unsecured creditors of the Company. No assets will be placed in trust, set aside or otherwise segregated to fund or offset liabilities in respect of the Program. 
 
 Section 4.4 Non-U.S. Directors 
 
 Directors who are foreign nationals or residents or employed outside the United States, or both, may participate in the Program on such terms and conditions different from those applicable to Directors who are not foreign nationals or residents or who are employed in the United States as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable in order to recognize differences in local law, regulations or tax policy.
