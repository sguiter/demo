shares of common stock for in net proceeds as of September 30, 2024. in grant funding to be received over a two-year period for its REM-001 project. During the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued an additional shares of common stock for net proceeds of from its at-the-market ATM facility, and announced that it is suspending the development of VAL-083. Even with the proceeds from the grant funding, the stock purchase financing, and the ATM sales, the Company will require additional funding to maintain its clinical trials, research and development projects, and for general operations. These circumstances indicate substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within from the date of filing of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements. On October 18, 2024, the Company completed the Merger with TuHURA, on and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement (Note 11). Consequently, management is pursuing various financing alternatives to fund the Company s operations so it can continue as a going concern. Management plans to continue to pursue opportunities to secure the necessary financing through the issue of new equity, including debt, entering into strategic partnership arrangements, and/or pursuing additional strategic transactions. However, the Company s ability to raise additional capital could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, global unrest. The Company may not be able to raise sufficient additional capital and may need to tailor its drug candidate development programs based on the amount of funding the Company is able to raise in the future. Nevertheless, there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, that may or may not be material to these condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

 Background 
 Kintara Therapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation Kintara or the Company ), is a clinical stage, biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new cancer therapies. 
 We are the parent company of Del Mar (BC), a British Columbia, Canada corporation, and Adgero Biopharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., a Delaware Corporation Adgero ). We are also the parent company to 0959454 B.C. Ltd. Callco and 0959456 B.C. Ltd. Exchangeco ), which are British Columbia, Canada corporations. Callco and Exchangeco were formed to facilitate the Reverse Acquisition that occurred in 2013. 
 
 References to we, us, and our, refer to Kintara and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Del Mar Pharmaceuticals (BC) Ltd. Del Mar (BC) ), Adgero, Adgero Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Adgero Bio ), Callco, and Exchangeco. 
 We are dedicated to the development of novel cancer therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. Our mission is to benefit patients by developing and commercializing anti-cancer therapies for patients whose solid tumors exhibit features that make them resistant to, or unlikely to respond to, currently available therapies, with particular focus on orphan cancer indications. 
 Our lead candidate is REM-001, a late-stage photodynamic therapy PDT for the treatment of cutaneous metastatic breast cancer CMBC ). PDT is a treatment that uses light sensitive compounds, or photosensitizers, that, when exposed to specific wavelengths of light, act as a catalyst to produce a form of reactive oxygen that induces local tumor cell death. 
 Recent Events 
 On October 4, 2024, the Company and Robert E. Hoffman, then-Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company, entered into an amendment (the Hoffman Amendment to that certain Executive Employment Agreement dated November 8, 2021 (the Hoffman Employment Agreement ), pursuant to which all outstanding stock options previously granted to Mr. Hoffman by the Company vested in full on October 4, 2024 in exchange for Mr. Hoffman agreeing to extend the non-competition restrictions of the Hoffman Employment Agreement for a period of twelve months following the date that his employment terminates with the Company. 

On October 18, 2024, we completed a previously-announced definitive merger agreement (the Merger Agreement with Kayak Mergeco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), and TuHURA Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation TuHURA ), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into TuHURA, with TuHURA surviving the merger and becoming our direct, wholly-owned subsidiary (the Merger ). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger, shareholders of TuHURA received shares of our common stock. Under the terms of the Merger, at the effective time of the Merger, (i) Kintara issued an aggregate of approximately 40,441,605 shares of common stock to TuHURA stockholders, based on an exchange ratio of 0.1789 (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split) shares of Kintara s common stock for each share of TuHURA common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger, (ii) each then-outstanding TuHURA stock option was assumed and converted into an option to purchase shares of Kintara common stock subject to certain adjustments based on the exchange ratio as set forth in the Merger Agreement, and (iii) each then-outstanding warrant to purchase shares of TuHURA common stock was assumed and converted into 

17 

and exchangeable based on the exchange ratio for a warrant of like tenor entitling the holder to purchase shares of Kintara common stock. 

Our stockholders existing as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger received one contingent value right(a CVR ), for each outstanding share Company common stock held by such stockholder (or, in the case of warrants to purchase Company common stock, each share of common stock for which such warrant is exercisable) entitling them to receive, in the aggregate, approximately 1,539,918 shares of our common stock upon achievement of enrollment of a minimum of 10 patients in the REM-001 Study, with such patients each completing eight weeks of follow-up on or before December 31, 2025 (the Milestone ). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, TuHURA stockholders as of immediately prior to the Merger owned, in aggregate and on a fully-diluted basis, approximately 97.15 of the Company (or 94.55 of the Company after giving effect to the issuance of the CVR Shares assuming the Milestone has been achieved) and Company securityholders as of immediately prior to the Merger owned, in aggregate and on a fully-diluted basis, approximately 2.85 of the Company (or 5.45 of the Company after giving effect to the issuance of the CVR Shares assuming the Milestone has been achieved). 

Effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on October 18, 2024, we completed a 1-for-35 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. Our common stock began trading on a reverse stock split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market on October 18, 2024 under the new name TuHURA Biosciences, Inc. and under the new symbol "HURA" following the closing of the Merger. The Company s common stock is represented by a new CUSIP number, 898920 103. 

Upcoming Clinical Milestones 
 Effective July 1, 2023, we were awarded a 2,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health NIH to be received over a two-year period as expenses are incurred. The grant from the NIH will fund the majority of expenses related to the REM-001 CMBC 15-patient clinical study (the REM-001 Study ). As a result of receiving the NIH grant, we re-initiated our REM-001 program and have opened enrollment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where we have initiated treatment in a total of four patients as of November 14, 2024. We expect to complete enrollment of patients in the REM-001 Study in the fourth calendar quarter of 2024. 
 REM-001 
 Background 
 Through REM-001, we are developing our photodynamic therapy PDT for the treatment of rare, unmet medical needs. PDT is a treatment that uses light sensitive compounds, or photosensitizers, that, when exposed to specific wavelengths of light, act as catalysts to produce a form of oxygen that induces local tumor cell death. REM-001 consists of three parts: the laser light source, the light delivery device, and the REM-001 drug product (collectively, the REM-001 Therapy ). REM-001 consists of an active pharmaceutical ingredient API in a lipid formulation. The REM-001 API is SnET2 tin ethyl etiopurpurin which is a second-generation PDT photosensitizer agent. We believe REM-001 possesses multiple advantages over earlier generation PDT compounds. 
 Our lead indication for REM-001 is CMBC which is a disease that may strike individuals with advanced breast cancer and for which effective treatment options are limited. In four Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 clinical studies in CMBC patients, primarily targeting patients who had previously received chemotherapy and failed radiation therapy, REM-001 Therapy was able to reduce, or eliminate, a substantial number of the treated CMBC tumors. Specifically, our analysis of the data collected from these studies indicates that in approximately 80 of evaluable tumor sites treated with REM-001 Therapy, there was a complete response; meaning that follow-up clinical assessments indicated no visible evidence of the tumor remaining. We believe clinical data indicates that REM-001 Therapy holds promise as a treatment to locally eliminate, or slow the growth of, treated cutaneous cancerous tumors in this difficult-to-treat patient population. 
 Numerous approaches have been utilized to treat CMBC patients, including various forms of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgical excision, hyperthermia, cryotherapy, electro-chemotherapy, topical drugs, and intra-lesional chemotherapy injections. However, for the most part, we believe that these therapies are often inadequate given the limited efficacy, toxicities and/or side effects of each. We believe our REM-001 Therapy has several advantages for this indication: it can be highly directed to the tumor site, has minimal systemic effects or normal tissue toxicities, can be used in conjunction with other therapies, and can be periodically repeated. 
 Our REM-001 Therapy product consists of three parts: the DD series laser light source (or equivalent), the ML2-0400 light delivery device (or equivalent) and the drug REM-001. In use, REM-001 is first administered by intravenous infusion and allowed to distribute within the body and be taken up by the tumors. Tumors are then illuminated with light using the light delivery device, which is attached to the laser light source, so that the accumulated REM-001 can be activated for the desired clinical effect. 
 As a result of our review of the historical data, we submitted questions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA under a Type C format to review the technology and results and determine the anticipated requirements for regulatory approval. On March 3, 2017, we received the FDA s written response to these questions. Based on that response, we have successfully 
 18 

manufactured REM-001 and developed light delivery devices for our planned 15-patient Phase 2 study. We received a Study May Proceed letter from the FDA for our 15-patient study on August 9, 2022. 
 On October 19, 2022, we announced that the REM-001 program in CMBC was paused to conserve cash which will be used to support the funding of the GBM AGILE Study. Effective July 1, 2023, we were awarded a two-year 2,000 Small Business Innovation Research grant from the National Institutes of Health to support the clinical development of REM-001 for the treatment of CMBC. The grant will be received in tranches of approximately 1,250 for the period July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, and approximately 750 for the period July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025. As a result of receiving the grant, we re-initiated our REM-001 program and have opened enrollment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where we have initiated treatment in a total of 4 patients as of November 14, 2024. We expect to complete enrollment of patients in the REM-001 Study in the fourth calendar quarter of 2024. 
 
 REM-001 Regulatory Filings 
 On August 9, 2022, we announced that we received a Study May Proceed letter from the FDA to begin our 15-patient study evaluating REM-001 PDT for the treatment of CMBC. The FDA has granted us Fast Track Designation FTD for REM-001 in CMBC. 
 VAL-083 
 On October 31, 2023, we announced preliminary topline results for VAL-083 from the GBM AGILE study. VAL-083 did not perform better than the current standards of care in glioblastoma and the preliminary safety data was similar to that of the current standards of care used to treat glioblastoma. As a result, we terminated the development of VAL-083. On February 13, 2024, we sent an Opt-Out Notice to Valent under the Valent Assignment Agreement whereby we assigned all rights, title, and interest in and to the patents for VAL-083 to Valent. As a result, we granted Valent a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide and non-transferable license, subject to limited exceptions. We are entitled to receive royalties from Valent s subsequent commercialization of VAL-083 equal to 5 of Valent Net Sales (as defined in the Valent Assignment Agreement). 
 Merger Agreement 
 See Recent Events above for a description of the Merger Agreement and transactions consummated thereby. 
 Compensation Matters 
 Robert E. Hoffman, former Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and the Company are parties to the Hoffman Employment Agreement, and on October 4, 2024, the Company and Mr. Hoffman entered into the Hoffman Amendment pursuant to the which, all outstanding stock options previously granted to Mr. Hoffman by the Company vested in full on October 4, 2024 in exchange for Mr. Hoffman agreeing to extend the non-competition restrictions of the Hoffman Employment Agreement for a period of twelve months following the date that his employment terminates with the Company.

Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses decreased to 252 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1,859 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was largely attributable to lower clinical development costs and related decreases in personnel and patent costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to termination of the development of VAL-083 in October of 2023. Non-cash, share-based compensation expense decreased to 38 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 86 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the recognition of higher compensation expense recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, for stock options granted in August 2023. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses were 1,957 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,103 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. A significant portion of the increase was a result of higher professional fees and special meeting fees incurred in relation to the transaction with TuHURA, offset by lower non-cash, share-based compensation expenses and a reduction in travel costs in the current three months compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Non-cash, share-based compensation expense decreased to 63 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 121 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the recognition of higher compensation expense recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, for stock options granted in August 2023. Personnel, facilities, office and sundry costs have increased primarily due to special meeting costs, filing fees, and shareholder communication costs related to the transaction with TuHURA. 
 Preferred Share Dividends 
 For each of the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we recorded 2 related to the cash dividend payable to Valent on the Series A Preferred Stock. The dividend has been recorded as a direct increase in accumulated deficit for both periods. In addition, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 13 (2023 - 173) related to the stock dividend payable to investors on the Series C Preferred Stock. The dividends have been recorded as a direct increase in accumulated deficit for both periods.

Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 1,889 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,317 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we reported net losses of 2,161 and 2,962, respectively. Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, included stock option expense of 98 and restricted stock unit expense of 3 being recognized during the current period compared to 160 and 47, respectively, in the same period in the prior fiscal year. 
 
 The most significant change in working capital for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was related to a decrease in prepaid expenses, taxes and other receivables of 156. The most significant changes in working capital for the three months ended September 30, 2023, were related to the use of clinical trial deposit to settle clinical trial expenses of 1,075 and settlement of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 214. 
 Investing Activities 
 There was no investing activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was nil for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 for the payment of the quarterly Series A Preferred Share dividend, which was in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at September 30, 2024. 
 Going Concern and Capital Expenditure Requirements 
 Going Concern and Management Plans 
 (See note 1 to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements) 
 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will continue our operations for the foreseeable future and contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported a loss of 2,161 and a negative cash flow from operations of 1,889. We had an accumulated deficit of 162,052 and had cash and cash equivalents of 3,020 as of September 30, 2024. We are in the clinical stage and have not generated any revenues to date. We do not have the prospect of achieving revenues until such time that our product candidate is commercialized, or partnered, which may not ever occur. On August 2, 2022, we entered into the Purchase Agreement under which we received approximately 2,008 in net proceeds as of September 30, 2024, for the issuance of an aggregate of 19 shares of common stock under the Purchase Agreement. On October 9, 2023, we received stockholder approval to issue 20 or more of our outstanding shares as of the date we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park. On February 22, 2024, we determined that we have concluded utilization of the equity facility pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. In addition, on June 28, 2023, we announced that we had been awarded approximately 2,000 in grant funding for our REM-001 project. 
 On September 19, 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement, (the Sales Agreement with AGP pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through AGP, as sales agent and/or principal, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 10,900 (the ATM Facility ). From October 31, 2023, until September 30, 2024, we raised 10,471 in net proceeds from the sale of 1,519 shares of our common stock under the ATM Facility. On February 22, 2024, we determined that we have concluded utilization of the ATM facility. 
 Even with the proceeds from the grant funding, the stock purchase financing, and the ATM sales, we will require significant additional funding to maintain our clinical trials, research and development projects, and for general operations. These circumstances 
 22 

indicate substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of filing of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Consequently, management began pursuing various financing alternatives to fund our operations in the short and long term and so we can continue as a going concern. In addition, we initiated a process to explore and review a range of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value, and as a result, entered into the Merger Agreement for the Merger with TuHURA, which closed on October 18, 2024. Our ability to raise additional capital is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. We may not be able to raise sufficient additional capital and may tailor our drug candidate development program based on the amount of funding we are able to raise in the future. Nevertheless, there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful. 
 The condensed consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material. 
 Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to: 
 the rate of progress and cost of our clinical studies, preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities; 

the costs associated with establishing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities; 

the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses, product candidates and technologies; 

the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 

the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; 

the effect of competing technological and market developments; 

the economic and other terms and timing of any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter; and 

the impact of us being a public entity. 

Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, or strategic collaborations. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and certain of those securities may have rights senior to those of our shares of capital stock. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any other third-party funding arrangement could require us to relinquish valuable rights. Economic conditions may affect the availability of funds and activity in equity markets. We do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or make changes to our operating plan, file for bankruptcy protection or pursue a dissolution of the Company and liquidation of all of our remaining assets. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders, if any, will depend heavily on the timing of such decision, as with the passage of time the amount of cash available for distribution will be reduced as we continue to fund our operations. We cannot provide assurance as to the amount of cash that will be available to distribute to shareholders, if any, after paying our debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves, nor as to the timing of any such distribution, if any. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, requires companies to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amount and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore actual results may differ from those estimates. 
 A detailed presentation of all of our significant accounting policies and the estimates derived therefrom is included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2024, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 7, 2024. While all of the significant accounting policies are important to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and the estimates derived therefrom are critical: 
 	 Fair value of financial instruments 
 	Accruals for research and development expenses and clinical trials 
 23 

Fair value of financial instruments 
 We recognize compensation costs resulting from the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, non-employees and directors as an expense in the statement of operations over the service period based on a measurement of fair value for each stock-based award. Prior to our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ASU 2018-07 ), stock options granted to non-employee consultants were revalued at the end of each reporting period until vested using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the changes in their fair value were recorded as adjustments to expense over the related vesting period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the determination of grant-date fair value for stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes model which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price, the anticipated exercise behavior of its grantee, interest rates, and dividend yields. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we utilized the plain vanilla method to determine the expected life of stock options. These variables are projected based on our historical data, experience, and other factors. Changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share-based payments. Such value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, net of actual forfeitures, using the accelerated attribution method. We recognize forfeitures as they occur. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results, or updated estimates, differ from current estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we issued stock options to our officers. The determination of grant-date fair value for options granted was estimated using the Black-Scholes model which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price, interest rates, dividend yields, and the term of the option. 
 Accruals for research and development expenses and clinical trials 
 As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, clinical research organizations and consultants, and under clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment terms that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate expenses in our financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services are performed and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the timing of various aspects of the expenses. We determine accrual estimates by taking into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress of clinical trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Our clinical trial accruals are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, there were no material adjustments to our prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures .

 (b) Changes in Internal Controls. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting .
