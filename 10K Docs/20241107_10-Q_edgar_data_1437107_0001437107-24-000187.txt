 A discount rate of . This is reflective of the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit and market conditions. 
 Given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a DCF analysis, actual results may differ from those used in the valuations. 
 The carrying value of the Networks reporting unit exceeded its fair value and the Company recorded a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of billion during the three months ended June 30, 2024 in impairments and loss on dispositions on the consolidated statements of operations. The goodwill impairment charge does not have an impact on the calculation of the Company s financial covenants under the Company s debt arrangements. 
 As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of remaining goodwill assigned to the Networks reporting unit was billion and the net assets of the reporting unit were approximately billion. The Networks segment included accumulated impairments of billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company performed goodwill and intangible assets impairment monitoring procedures for all of its reporting units and identified no indicators of impairment or triggering events. The Company continues to monitor its reporting units for triggers that could impact recoverability of goodwill. Long-term trends and risks the Company is monitoring in its ongoing assessment include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 the delta between market capitalization and book value; 
 uncertainty related to affiliate rights renewals associated with the Company s Networks and DTC reporting units; 
 declining levels of global GDP growth and continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market associated with the Company s Networks reporting unit; 
 content licensing trends and volatility related to the performance of theatrical film and game slates in our Studios reporting unit; and 
 risks in executing the projected growth strategies of the Company s DTC reporting unit. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The determination of fair value of the Company s reporting units represents a Level 3 fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. Changes in significant judgments and estimates could significantly impact the determined fair value of the reporting unit or the valuation of intangible assets. Changes to assumptions that would decrease the fair value of the reporting unit may result in corresponding increases to the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. 
 Intangible Assets 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2024 and the long-term trends and risks associated with the Company s Networks reporting unit, the Company reassessed and shortened the useful lives for certain of its linear networks trade names. This change was considered a change in

million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reassessed the useful lives and amortization methods for its linear networks and HBO trademarks and trade names and concluded the pattern of amortization should be accelerated. Accordingly, the Company changed the amortization method for these assets from the straight-line method to the sum-of-the months digits method effective July 1, 2023. This change was considered a change in estimate, was accounted for prospectively, and resulted in incremental amortization expense of million during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Derivatives Designated for Hedge Accounting 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk related to revenues, production rebates and production expenses. As production spend occurs or when rebate receivables are recognized, foreign forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are de-designated. Upon de-designation, gains and losses on these derivatives directly impact earnings in the same line and same period as the hedged risk. 
 In April 2023, the Company unwound cross-currency swaps related to its Sterling debt and recognized a gain of million as an adjustment to other comprehensive income. The Sterling debt was subsequently re-designated as a net investment hedge effective May 2023, and in May 2024, the Company de-designated million of the Sterling debt. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid the Sterling debt in full at maturity and settled the remaining million designated as a net investment hedge.

 If current fair valu es of designated cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2024 remained static over the next twelve months, the amount the Company would reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income in the next twelve months would not be material for the current fiscal year. The maximum length of time the Company is hedging exposure to the variability in future cash flows is years. 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 The Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross currency swaps to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with the net assets of non-USD functional entities. 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2024, to mitigate the currency risk associated with the net assets of non-USD functional entities, the Company designated its million denominated debt issued in May 2024 as a net investment hedge (See Note 8) and designated an additional million of fixed-to-fixed cross currency swaps as a net investment hedge. The Company de-designated million of its Euro denominated debt during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2023, to mitigate the currency risk associated with the net assets of non-USD functional entities, the Company re-designated its Sterling denominated debt due in 2024 as a net investment hedge after the unwind of the cash flow hedge previously noted. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company settled its Euro denominated debt that was designated as the hedging instrument in a net investment hedge.

 Fair Value Hedges 
 During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company issued billion of fixed rate senior notes due March 2026. Simultaneously, the Company entered into a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge to allow the Company to mitigate the variability in the fair value of its senior notes due to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate. Changes in the fair value of the senior note and the interest rate swap were recorded in interest expense, net.

 million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and income tax benefit was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of billion, the majority of which was not deductible for tax purposes. (See Note 2.) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in income tax benefit compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to the effect of foreign operations, including a net tax benefit related to prior year tax positions finalized in tax returns filed during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in income tax benefit was partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax book loss. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in income tax benefit compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributed to a decrease in pre-tax book loss (excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge), and an increase in uncertain tax positions, primarily attributable to a one-time favorable audit resolution reserve release included in the 2023 income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in tax benefits associated with the foreign operations. 
 Income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily attributable to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and the effect of foreign operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s reserves for uncertain tax positions totaled million and million, respectively. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to certain of the Company s uncertain tax positions could decrease by as much as million within the next twelve months as a result of ongoing audits, lapses of statutes of limitations or regulatory developments. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued million and million, respectively, of total interest and penalties payable related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. This section provides additional information regarding our businesses, current developments, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additional context can also be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). 
 INDUSTRY TRENDS 
 The Writers Guild of America WGA and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists SAG-AFTRA went on strike in May and July 2023, respectively, following the expiration of their respective collective bargaining agreements with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers AMPTP ). The WGA strike ended on September 27, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on October 9, 2023. The SAG-AFTRA strike ended on November 9, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on December 5, 2023. 
 The strikes had a material impact on the operations and results of the Company in 2023, including a pause on certain theatrical and television productions. Effects included a positive impact on cash flow from operations attributed to delayed production spend, and a negative impact on the results of operations attributed to timing and performance of the 2023 film slate, as well as the Company s ability to produce, license, and deliver content. The Company experienced content delivery delays in the first quarter of 2024 due to the pause in television productions in 2023, but does not expect any material impacts for the remainder of 2024. 
 Other headwinds in the industry, such as continued pressures on linear distribution and continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market, have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material impact on the operations and results of the Company, including a negative impact on the results of operations attributed to declines in linear advertising revenue. In addition, declines in linear subscribers are expected to continue throughout 2024. The increase of digital advertising available in the marketplace has also resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased competition for advertising expenditures for both traditional linear networks and ad-supported tiers in streaming services. 
 We continue to closely monitor the ongoing impact of industry trends to our business; however, the full effects on our operations and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Discovery is a leading global media and entertainment company that creates and distributes a differentiated and complete portfolio of branded content across television, film, streaming and gaming. Warner Bros. Discovery inspires, informs and entertains audiences worldwide through its iconic brands and products including: Discovery Channel, Max, discovery+, CNN, DC, TNT Sports, Eurosport, HBO, HGTV, Food Network, OWN, Investigation Discovery, TLC, Magnolia Network, TNT, TBS, truTV, Travel Channel, MotorTrend, Animal Planet, Science Channel, Warner Bros.

 We are home to powerful creative engines and one of the largest collections of owned content in the world. WBD has one of the strongest hands in the industry in terms of the completeness and quality of assets and intellectual property across sports, news, lifestyle, and entertainment in virtually every region of the globe and in most languages. We serve audiences and consumers around the world with content that informs, entertains, and, when at its best, inspires. 
 Our asset mix positions us to drive a balanced approach to creating long-term value for shareholders. It represents the full entertainment ecosystem, and the ability to serve consumers across the entire spectrum of offerings from domestic and international networks, premium pay-TV, streaming, production and release of feature films and original series, related consumer products and themed experience licensing, and interactive gaming. 
 In connection with the Merger, the Company has announced and has taken actions to implement projects to achieve cost synergies for the Company. The Company s ongoing restructuring and transformation initiatives include, among other things, strategic content programming assessments, organization restructuring, facility consolidation activities, and other contract termination costs. While the Company s restructuring efforts are ongoing, this restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2024. We expect to incur up to 5.3 billion in pre-tax charges, of which we have incurred 4.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 related to this plan. Of the total expected pre-tax charges, we expect total cash expenditures to be 1.0 - 1.5 billion. 
 31 

As of September 30, 2024, we classified our operations in three reportable segments: 
 Studios - Our Studios segment primarily consists of the production and release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, production and initial licensing of television programs to third parties and our networks/DTC services, distribution of our films and television programs to various third party and internal television and streaming services, distribution through the home entertainment market (physical and digital), related consumer products and themed experience licensing, and interactive gaming. 
 Networks - Our Networks segment primarily consists of our domestic and international television networks. 
 DTC - Our DTC segment primarily consists of our premium pay-TV and streaming services. 
 Our segment presentation is aligned with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make decisions about operating matters, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Foreign Exchange Impacting Comparability 
 The impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons of our results. For example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis ex-FX ), in addition to results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-FX excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. The presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 The ex-FX change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. The ex-FX change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process (the 2024 Baseline Rate ), and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2024 Baseline Rate. In addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-FX results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities, as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Revenues 
 Distribution revenue decreased 1 and 2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily attributable to a 9 and 8 decline in Networks domestic linear subscribers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and lower domestic subscribers at DTC largely resulting from continued linear wholesale subscriber declines in the U.S., partially offset by a 5 increase in domestic, linear contractual affiliate rates for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and a 15 increase in subscribers and an increase in pricing for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, following the launch of Max in Latin America in the first quarter of 2024 and in Europe in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Advertising revenue decreased 7 and 5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily attributable to audience declines in domestic linear networks of 21 and 15 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, partially offset by an increase in domestic Max ad-lite subscribers. 
 Content revenue decreased 4 and 10 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 40 decrease in theatrical product revenue attributable to lower film rental revenue due to the strong prior year performance of Barbie , which was released in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by the sublicensing of Olympic sports rights in Europe in the current year, which had a favorable impact of 578 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 60 decrease in games revenue due to the strong performance of the 2023 slate, including Hogwarts Legacy , compared to the 2024 slate and a 10 decrease in television product revenue attributable to fewer television series availabilities resulting in lower licensing revenue, partially offset by the sublicensing of Olympic sports rights in Europe in the current year which had a favorable impact of 578 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other revenue decreased 7 and 1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily attributable to the timing of services provided to the unconsolidated TNT Sports UK joint venture. In addition, the decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also attributable to lower studio production services due to the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, partially offset by the opening of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo in June 2023. 
 Costs of Revenues 
 Our principal component of costs of revenues is content expense. Content expense includes television/digital series, specials, films, games, and sporting events. Amortization related to both historical cost basis and any fair value adjustments to content arising from business combinations is included in costs of revenues. The costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of production costs, participation costs, and exploitation costs. 
 Costs of revenues decreased 2 and 6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 37 decrease in theatrical product content expense as a result of lower revenues, lower content expense related to the amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, and lower Networks and DTC content expense, including our exit from the AT T SportsNet business, partially offset by the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year. 
 The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower content expense related to the amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, a 14 decrease in television product expense commensurate with lower television revenue, and lower Networks content expense, including our exit from the AT T SportsNet business, partially offset by the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year. The exit from the AT T SportsNet business had favorable impacts to costs of revenues of 97 million and 276 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year had unfavorable impacts to costs of revenues of 663 million and 665 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4 and decreased 2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher overhead expenses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower marketing costs due to the prior year launch of Max in the U.S. and lower overhead expenses. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 11 and 9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily attributable to intangible assets acquired during the Merger that are being amortized using the sum of the months digits method, partially offset by the shortening of the useful lives of certain intangible assets. (See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 
 34 

Restructuring and other charges 
 Restructuring and other charges decreased 97 and 69 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Restructuring and other charges primarily includes contract terminations, facility consolidation activities, organizational restructuring, and other charges. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 
 Impairments and Loss on Dispositions 
 Impairments and loss on dispositions was 5 million and 9,412 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Impairments and loss on dispositions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 9.1 billion pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Networks reporting unit during the three months ended June 30, 2024 (see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and a 231 million ROU asset impairment charge related to the Hudson Yards, New York office lease. (See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense, net decreased 80 million and 192 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily attributable to lower debt during the period. (See Note 8 and Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 
 Gain on extinguishment of debt 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid in full at maturity 40 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our floating rate notes due March 2024 and we repurchased or repaid 5,387 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes. (See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 
 Loss From Equity Investees, net 
 Losses from our equity method investees were 18 million and 89 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The changes are attributable to our share of earnings and losses from our equity investees. (See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

Income Tax Benefit 
 Income tax benefit was 319 million and 125 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and income tax benefit was 190 million and 563 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 9.1 billion, the majority of which was not deductible for tax purposes. (See Note 2.) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in income tax benefit compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to the effect of foreign operations, including a net tax benefit related to prior year tax positions finalized in tax returns filed during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in income tax benefit was partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax book loss. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in income tax benefit compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributed to a decrease in pre-tax book loss (excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge), and an increase in uncertain tax positions, primarily attributable to a one-time favorable audit resolution reserve release included in the 2023 income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in tax benefits associated with the foreign operations. 
 Income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily attributable to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and the effect of foreign operations. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s OECD Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion GloBE model rules, issued under the OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, introduce a global minimum tax of 15 applicable to multinational enterprise groups with consolidated financial statement revenue in excess of 750 million. Numerous foreign jurisdictions have already enacted tax legislation based on the GloBE rules, with some effective as early as January 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we recognized a nominal income tax expense for Pillar Two GloBE minimum tax. The Company is continuously monitoring the evolving application of this legislation and assessing its potential impact on our future tax liability. 
 Segment Results of Operations 
 The Company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding: 
 employee share-based compensation; 
 depreciation and amortization; 
 restructuring and facility consolidation; 
 certain impairment charges; 
 gains and losses on business and asset dispositions; 
 third-party transaction and integration costs; 
 amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content; 
 amortization of capitalized interest for content; and 
 other items impacting comparability. 
 The Company uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes employee share-based compensation, restructuring, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and transaction and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. Integration costs include transformative system implementations and integrations, such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, and may take several years to complete. The Company also excludes the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content (which is included in consolidated costs of revenues), and amortization of capitalized interest for content, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income, and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We prospectively updated certain corporate allocations at the beginning of 2024. The impact to prior periods was immaterial.

Studios Segment 
 The following table presents, for our Studios segment, revenues by type, certain operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income (loss) (in millions).

 Unless otherwise indicated, the discussion of percent changes below is on an ex-FX basis. The Studios discussion below also includes intra-segment revenue and expense between product lines, which represented less than 3 of total revenues and operating expenses for this segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Intra-segment revenue and expense are eliminated at the Studios segment level. 
 Fluctuations in results for our Studios segment may occur due to various factors, including (but not limited to) the timing and number of new film releases each quarter, the timing of marketing expenses recognized relative to (i.e., prior to) a film s release, and the mix of content distributed each period. 
 Revenues 
 Content revenue decreased 18 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to a 40 decrease in theatrical product revenue and a 31 decrease in games revenue, partially offset by a 30 increase in television product revenue. 
 The decrease in theatrical product revenue was attributable to lower film rental revenue due to the strong prior year performance of Barbie , which was released in the third quarter of 2023. 
 The decrease in games revenue was attributable to the better prior year performance of Mortal Kombat 1, which was released in September 2023 compared to less significant releases in the third quarter of 2024. 
 The increase in television product revenue was attributable to higher initial telecast revenue due to the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes in the prior year. 
 Content revenue decreased 13 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to a 60 decrease in games revenue, a 10 decrease in television product revenue, and a 2 decrease in theatrical product revenue. 
 The decrease in theatrical product revenue was attributable to lower film rental revenue and intra-segment licensing revenue, partially offset by higher home entertainment revenue. Film rental revenue decreased due to the strong prior year performance of Barbie , which was released in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher carryover releases from the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Home entertainment revenue increased due to the performance of Dune: Part Two, Wonka, and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire . 
 38 

The decrease in games revenue was attributable to the strong performance of the 2023 slate, including Hogwarts Legacy , compared to the 2024 slate. 
 The decrease in television product revenue was attributable to fewer television series availabilities in 2024 resulting in lower licensing revenue. 
 Other revenue was flat and increased 7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the opening of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo in June 2023, partially offset by lower studio production services due to the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. 
 Costs of Revenues 
 Costs of revenues decreased 3 and 1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 37 decrease in theatrical product content expense as a result of lower revenues and lower average cost per title, partially offset by 31 higher television product content expense commensurate with higher television product revenue, and 47 higher games content expense due to impairments of 122 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 14 decrease in television product expense commensurate with lower television product revenue was partially offset by a 6 increase in theatrical product content expense due to product mix, and a 9 increase in games content expense due to impairments of 335 million. The increase in games content expense was partially offset by lower intra-segment licensing costs. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 10 and 5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower theatrical and games marketing expenses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower overhead expenses and lower games marketing expenses. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA decreased 58 and 56 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Networks Segment 
 The table below presents, for our Networks segment, revenues by type, certain operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income (in millions).

Revenues 
 Distribution revenue decreased 7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to a 9 and 8 decline in domestic linear subscribers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, partially offset by a 5 increase in domestic contractual affiliate rates for both periods. In addition, the exit from the AT T SportsNet business had unfavorable impacts of 68 million and 215 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Declines in linear subscribers are expected to continue throughout 2024. 
 Advertising revenue decreased 13 and 11 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily attributable to audience declines in domestic networks of 21 and 15 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market, partially offset by the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year. 
 Content revenue increased 618 million and 652 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily attributable to the sublicensing of Olympic sports rights in Europe in the current year, which had a favorable impact of 578 million on content revenue. 
 Other revenue decreased 21 and 18 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily attributable to the timing of services provided to the unconsolidated TNT Sports UK joint venture. 
 Costs of Revenues 
 Costs of revenues increased 22 and decreased 1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year, partially offset by lower content expense, including our exit from the AT T SportsNet business. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to our exit from the AT T SportsNet business and lower content expense, including the allocation of U.S. sports costs to DTC, partially offset by the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year. The exit from the AT T SportsNet business had favorable impacts to costs of revenues of 97 million and 276 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year had unfavorable impacts to costs of revenues of 663 million and 665 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6 and was flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher overhead expenses and marketing expenses related to the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, lower overhead expenses were offset by higher marketing expenses related to the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA decreased 11 and 9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The broadcast of the Olympics in Europe negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA by 65 million and 66 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 1 Direct-to-Consumer subscriber - We define a Core DTC Subscription as: 
 (i) a retail subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product (defined below) for which we have recognized subscription revenue, whether directly or through a third party, from a direct-to-consumer platform; (ii) a wholesale subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product for which we have recognized subscription revenue from a fixed-fee arrangement with a third party and where the individual user has activated their subscription; (iii) a wholesale subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product for which we have recognized subscription revenue on a per subscriber basis; (iv) a retail or wholesale subscription to an independently-branded, regional product sold on a stand-alone basis that includes discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, and/or a Premium Sports Product, for which we have recognized subscription revenue (as per (i)-(iii) above); and (v) users on free trials who convert to a subscription for which we have recognized subscription revenue within the first seven days of the calendar month immediately following the month in which their free trial expires. 
 The Company defines a Premium Sports Product as a strategically prioritized, sports-focused product sold on a stand-alone basis and made available directly to consumers. The current independently-branded, regional products referred to in (iv) above consist of TVN/Player and BluTV. Subscribers to multiple WBD DTC products (listed above) are counted as a paid subscriber for each individual WBD DTC product subscription. We may refer to the aggregate number of DTC Subscriptions as subscribers .

 41 

Distribution revenue increased 8 and 3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily attributable to a 15 increase in subscribers and an increase in pricing following the launch of Max in Latin America in the first quarter of 2024 and in Europe in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by continued domestic linear wholesale subscriber declines. 
 Advertising revenue increased 51 and 73 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily attributable to an increase in domestic ad-lite subscribers. 
 Global ARPU consisted of the following. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (ex-FX) 2024 2023 Change (ex-FX) Domestic ARPU 11.99 11.29 6 11.93 11.06 8 International ARPU 4.05 3.98 7 3.89 3.84 5 Global ARPU 2 7.84 7.88 1 7.89 7.73 3 
 Global ARPU increased 1 and 3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily attributable to subscriber growth of the ad-lite tier domestically, higher pricing, and a continuing subscriber mix shift from linear wholesale, partially offset by growth in lower ARPU international markets. 
 Content revenue decreased 11 and 54 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily attributable to fewer third-party licensing deals. 
 Costs of Revenues 
 Costs of revenues decreased 5 and increased 2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower content expense due to timing of programming releases, partially offset by the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher sports related expenses driven by the allocation of U.S. sports from the Networks segment and the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe, partially offset by decreased non-sports content expense. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 27 and decreased 6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher overhead expenses, higher marketing expenses due to the continuation of Max launches, and the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower marketing costs due to the prior year launch of Max in the U.S. and lower overhead expenses, partially offset by the continuation of Max launches internationally. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased 178 million and 110 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The broadcast of the Olympics in Europe negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA by 41 million and 42 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 2 ARPU: The Company defines DTC Average Revenue Per User ARPU as total subscription revenue plus net advertising revenue for the period divided by the daily average number of paying subscribers for the period. Where daily values are not available, the sum of beginning of period and end of period divided by two is used. 
 Excluded from the ARPU calculation are: (i) Revenue and subscribers for DTC products, other than discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, a Premium Sports Product, and independently-branded, regional products (currently consisting of TVN/Player and BluTV), that may be offered by us or by certain joint venture partners or affiliated parties from time to time; (ii) A limited amount of international discovery+ revenue and subscribers that are part of non-strategic partnerships or short-term arrangements as may be identified by the Company from time to time; (iii) Cinemax, Max/HBO hotel and bulk institution (i.e., subscribers billed on a bulk basis), and international basic HBO revenue and subscribers; and (iv) Users on free trials who convert to a subscription for which we have recognized subscription revenue within the first seven days of the calendar month immediately following the month in which their free trial expires.

Corporate 
 The following table presents our Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss (in millions). 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (ex-FX) 2024 2023 Change Change (ex-FX) Adjusted EBITDA (296) (328) 10 10 (927) (928) (1) Depreciation and amortization 93 54 233 215 Employee share-based compensation 157 140 413 381 Restructuring and other charges 18 53 70 70 Transaction and integration costs 31 37 161 115 Facility consolidation costs 1 14 2 37 Impairment and amortization of fair value step-up for content 1 1 2 (7) Inter-segment eliminations 2 (16) Impairments and loss on dispositions 4 10 242 42 Operating loss (601) (639) (2,050) (1,765) 
 Corporate operations primarily consist of executive management and administrative support services, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense, as well as substantially all of our share-based compensation and third-party transaction and integration costs. 
 Adjusted EBITDA improved 10 and decreased 1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The improvement for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower facility costs and personnel costs, partially offset by higher overhead expenses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher overhead and securitization expenses, partially offset by lower facility costs. 
 Inter-segment Eliminations 
 The following table presents our inter-segment eliminations by revenue and expense, Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss (in millions). 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Inter-segment revenue eliminations (705) (551) (1,731) (1,811) Inter-segment expense eliminations (702) (614) (1,766) (1,815) Adjusted EBITDA (3) 63 35 4 Restructuring and other charges (2) Impairment and amortization of fair value step-up for content 64 108 217 358 Operating loss (67) (45) (182) (352) 
 Inter-segment revenue and expense eliminations primarily represent inter-segment content transactions and marketing and promotion activity between reportable segments. In our current segment structure, in certain instances, production and distribution activities are in different segments. Inter-segment content transactions are presented at market value (i.e., the segment producing and/or licensing the content reports revenue and profit from inter-segment transactions in a manner similar to the reporting of third-party transactions, and the required eliminations are reported on the separate Eliminations line when presenting our summary of segment results). Generally, timing of revenue recognition is similar to the reporting of third-party transactions. The segment distributing the content, e.g., via our DTC or linear services, capitalizes the cost of inter-segment content transactions, including mark-ups and amortizes the costs over the shorter of the license term, if applicable, or the expected period of use. The content amortization expense related to the inter-segment profit is also eliminated on the separate Eliminations line when presenting our summary of segment results.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 Sources of Cash 
 Historically, we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations.

Access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured. We have a 6.0 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program described below. We also participate in a revolving receivables program and an accounts receivable factoring program described below. 
 Debt 
 Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement and had the capacity to borrow up to 6.0 billion under the Revolving Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility ). We could also request additional commitments up to 1.0 billion from the lenders upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Agreement contained customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement. In October 2024, the Company replaced the Revolving Credit Agreement with a new multicurrency revolving credit agreement. (See Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 
 Additionally, our commercial paper program is supported by the Credit Facility. Under the commercial paper program, we may issue up to 1.5 billion, including up to 500 million of euro-denominated borrowings. Borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility is effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed and repaid 14,203 million under our Credit Facility and commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility or the commercial paper program. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 650 million of 4.302 fixed rate senior notes due January 2030 and 850 million of 4.693 fixed rate senior notes due May 2033. After December 2029 and February 2033, respectively, the senior notes are redeemable at par plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
 Revolving Receivables Program 
 We have a revolving agreement to transfer up to 5,200 million of certain receivables through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, Warner Bros. Discovery Receivables Funding, LLC, to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. We service the sold receivables for the financial institution for a fee and pay fees to the financial institution in connection with this revolving agreement. As customers pay their balances, our available capacity under this revolving agreement increases and typically we transfer additional receivables into the program. In some cases, we may have collections that have not yet been remitted to the bank, resulting in a liability. The outstanding portfolio of receivables derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets was 4,761 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Accounts Receivable Factoring 
 We have a factoring agreement to sell certain of our non-U.S. trade accounts receivable on a limited recourse basis to a third-party financial institution. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the Company s factoring arrangement was 57 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investments 
 In May 2024, we sold our 50 interest in All3Media, an equity method investment, for proceeds of 324 million. 
 Uses of Cash 
 Our primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, income taxes, personnel costs, costs to develop and market our enhanced streaming service Max, principal and interest payments on our outstanding senior notes, funding for various equity method and other investments, and repurchases of our capital stock. 
 44 

Content Acquisition 
 We plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content, as well as certain sports rights. Contractual commitments to acquire content have not materially changed as set forth in Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Debt 
 Floating Rate Notes 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid 40 million of aggregate principal amount of our floating rate notes due March 2024. 
 Senior Notes 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased or repaid 5,387 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes. In addition, we have 296 million of senior notes coming due in November 2024, and an additional 2,749 million of senior notes coming due through September 30, 2025. 
 We may from time to time seek to prepay, retire or purchase our other outstanding indebtedness through prepayments, redemptions, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Any such repurchases or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, as well as applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not we repurchase or exchange any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases or exchanges will be determined at our discretion. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We effected capital expenditures of 662 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, including amounts capitalized to support Max. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs to develop and market Max. 
 Investments and Business Combinations 
 Our uses of cash have included investments in equity method investments and equity investments without readily determinable fair value. (See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) We also provide funding to our investees from time to time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we contributed 104 million for investments in and advances to our investees. 
 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest and Noncontrolling Interest 
 We had redeemable equity balances of 117 million at September 30, 2024, which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to us. Distributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests totaled 172 million and 282 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Income Taxes and Interest 
 We expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made cash payments of 832 million and 1,873 million for income taxes and interest on our outstanding debt, respectively. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents changes in cash and cash equivalents (in millions). Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period 4,319 3,930 Cash provided by operating activities 2,660 3,899 Cash used in investing activities (355) (1,025) Cash used in financing activities (3,149) (4,308) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 15 (66) Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (829) (1,500) Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period 3,490 2,430 
 45 

Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 2,660 million and 3,899 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income, excluding non-cash items, partially offset by lower net content investment in 2024. Cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was also positively impacted by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities was 355 million and 1,025 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to fewer purchases of property and equipment and proceeds from the sale of investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities was 3,149 million and 4,308 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to lower net debt activity and lower distributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, partially offset by a decrease in securitization receivables collected but not remitted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Capital Resource s 
 As of September 30, 2024, capital resources were comprised of the following (in millions). 
 September 30, 2024 Total Capacity Outstanding Indebtedness Unused Capacity Cash and cash equivalents 3,336 3,336 Revolving credit facility and commercial paper program 6,000 6,000 Senior notes (a) 
 40,232 40,232 Total 49,568 40,232 9,336 (a) Interest on the senior notes is paid annually or semi-annually. Our senior notes outstanding as of September 30, 2024 had interest rates that ranged from 1.90 to 8.30 and will mature between 2024 and 2062. 
 
 We expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations and availability under the Revolving Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for both the short-term and the long-term. Our borrowing costs and access to capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. Credit rating agencies may continue to 
 review and adjust our ratings or outlook. For example, in August 2024, S P revised our ratings outlook from stable to negative 
 primarily due to declines in our linear business, including as a result of the weak operating environment for linear networks. 
 The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate to the U.S. However, if these funds were to be needed in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay non-U.S. taxes to repatriate them. The determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable. 
 
 Summarized Guarantor Financial Information

CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our business, marketing and operating strategies, integration of acquired businesses, new product and service offerings, financial prospects and anticipated sources and uses of capital. Words such as anticipate, assume, believe, continue, estimate, expect, forecast, future, intend, plan, potential, predict, project, strategy, target and similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like could, may, might, should, will and would, among other terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be accomplished. The following is a list of some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated: 
 more intense competitive pressure from existing or new competitors in the industries in which we operate; 
 reduced spending on domestic and foreign television advertising, due to macroeconomic, industry or consumer behavior trends or unexpected reductions in our number of subscribers; 
 uncertainties associated with product and service development and market acceptance, including the development and provision of programming for new television and telecommunications technologies, and the success of our streaming services; 
 market demand for foreign first-run and existing content libraries; 
 negative publicity or damage to our brands, reputation or talent; 
 realizing direct-to-consumer subscriber goals; 
 industry trends, including the timing of, and spending on, sports programming, feature film, television and television commercial production; 
 the possibility or duration of an industry-wide strike, such as the strikes of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA in 2023, player lock-outs or other job action affecting a major entertainment industry union, athletes or others involved in the development and production of our sports programming, television programming, feature films and interactive entertainment (e.g., games) who are covered by collective bargaining agreements; 
 disagreements with our distributors or other business partners; 
 continued consolidation of distribution customers and production studios; 
 potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences or unforeseen increased expenses associated with the WarnerMedia Business or our efforts to integrate the WarnerMedia Business; 
 adverse outcomes of legal proceedings or disputes, including those related to our acquisition of the WarnerMedia Business; 
 changes in, or failure or inability to comply with, laws and government regulations, including, without limitation, regulations of the Federal Communications Commission and similar authorities internationally and data privacy regulations and adverse outcomes from regulatory proceedings; 
 inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial forecasts; 
 our level of debt, including the significant indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of the WarnerMedia Business, and our future compliance with debt covenants; 
 changes to our corporate or debt-specific credit ratings or outlook; 
 threatened or actual cyber-attacks and cybersecurity breaches; 
 theft of our content and unauthorized duplication, distribution and exhibition of such content; and 
 general economic and business conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, global events such as pandemics, and political unrest in the international markets in which we operate. 
 48 

These risks have the potential to impact the recoverability of the assets recorded on our balance sheets, including goodwill and other intangibles. Management s expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of any forward-looking statements we make, cannot be foreseen with certainty and are subject to change due to a broad range of factors affecting the U.S. and global economies and regulatory environments, factors specific to Warner Bros. Discovery, and other factors described under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Form 10-Q for the quarters-ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024. These forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties, and other factors speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about our existing market risk are set forth in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in the 2023 Form 10-K. Our exposures to market risk have not materially changed since December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 49 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to various litigation matters and claims, including claims related to employees, stockholders, vendors, other business partners, government regulations, or intellectual property, as well as disputes and matters involving counterparties to contractual agreements, such as disputes arising out of definitive agreements entered into in connection with the Merger. A determination as to the amount of the accrual required for such contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgment about future events. The Company may not currently be able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for certain matters until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of such loss. In the absence of sufficient information to support an assessment of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, no accrual for such contingencies is made and no loss or range of loss is disclosed. (See Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the impact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company s results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not currently believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s future consolidated financial position, future results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Between September 23, 2022 and October 24, 2022, two purported class action lawsuits (Collinsville Police Pension Board v. Discovery, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-08171; Todorovski v. Discovery, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-09125) were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints named Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., Discovery, Inc., David Zaslav, and Gunnar Wiedenfels as defendants. The complaints generally alleged that the defendants made false and misleading statements in SEC filings and in certain public statements relating to the Merger, in violation of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and sought damages and other relief. On November 4, 2022, the court consolidated the Collinsville and Todorovski complaints under case number 1:22-CV-8171, and on December 12, 2022, the court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. On February 15, 2023, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding Advance/Newhouse Partnership, Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership, Steven A. Miron, Robert J. Miron, and Steven O. Newhouse as defendants. The amended complaint asserted violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and sought damages and other relief. On February 5, 2024, the court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice. On March 4, 2024, plaintiffs filed an appeal. On November 1, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the February 5, 2024 judgment. 
 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 Investors should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors that could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as set forth under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of the Company s Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended March 31, 2024 and Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended June 30, 2024. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be material may also adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
