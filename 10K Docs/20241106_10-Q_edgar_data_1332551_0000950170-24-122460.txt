However, all of the Company s cash deposits are held at multiple, established financial institutions, in multiple accounts associated with its parent and respective consolidated subsidiaries, to minimize credit risk exposure. The Company has not experienced, and does not expect, any losses on its cash and cash equivalents. Restricted cash includes required account balance minimums primarily for the Company s CRE debt securitizations as well as cash held in the syndicated corporate loan collateralized debt obligations ("CDOs").

million at September 30, 2024 , as the Company believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

 VIEs at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (collectively, the "Consolidated VIEs"). The Consolidated VIEs are CRE securitizations that were formed on behalf of the Company to invest in CRE whole loans that were financed by the issuance of debt securities. By financing these assets with long-term borrowings through the issuance of debt securities, the Company seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted equity returns and to match the term of its assets and liabilities. The primary beneficiary determination for each of these VIEs was made at each VIE s inception and is continually assessed. The Consolidated VIEs are accounted for as secured borrowings in accordance with GAAP. The Company has exposure to losses on its securitizations to the extent of its investments in the subordinated debt and preferred equity of each securitization. The Company is entitled to receive payments of principal and interest on the debt securities it holds and, to the extent revenues exceed debt service requirements and other expenses of the securitizations, distributions with respect to its preferred equity interests. As a result of consolidation, the debt and equity interests the Company holds in these securitizations have been eliminated; and the Company s consolidated balance sheets reflect the assets held, debt issued by the securitizations to third parties and any accrued payables to third parties. The Company s operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts related to the securitizations assets and liabilities as opposed to the Company s net economic interests in the securitizations. Assets and liabilities related to the securitizations are disclosed, in the aggregate, on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. For a discussion of the debt issued through the securitizations, see Note 10. Creditors of the Company s Consolidated VIEs have recourse to the general credit of the Company, nor to each other. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not provide any financial support to either of its Consolidated VIEs nor does it have any requirement to do so, although it may choose to do so in the future to maximize future cash flows on such investments by the Company. There are no explicit arrangements that obligate the Company to provide financial support to either of its Consolidated VIEs. Charles Street-ACRES FSU Student Venture, LLC In April 2022, the Company contributed an initial investment of million for a interest in Charles Street-ACRES FSU Student Venture, LLC (the "FSU Student Venture"). The FSU Student Venture, a joint venture between the Company and two unrelated third parties, was formed for the purpose of developing a student housing project. The FSU Student Venture was determined not to be a VIE as there was sufficient equity at risk, it does not have disproportionate voting rights and its members all have the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct activities (2) the obligation to absorb losses and (3) the right to receive residual returns. However, the Company consolidated the FSU Student Venture due to its interest that provides the Company with control over all major decisions of the joint venture. The portion of the joint venture that the Company does not own is presented as non-controlling interest at and for the periods presented in the Company s consolidated financial statements. Unconsolidated VIEs (the Company is not the primary beneficiary, but has a variable interest) Based on management s analysis, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs discussed below since it does not have both (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE. Accordingly, the following VIEs are not consolidated in the Company s financial statements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company continuously reassesses whether it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of its unconsolidated VIEs. The Company s maximum exposure to risk for each of these unconsolidated VIEs is set forth in the "Maximum Exposure to Loss" column in the table below.

 interest in the common shares of each of Resource Capital Trust I ("RCT I") and RCC Trust II ("RCT II"), respectively, with a value of million in the aggregate, or of each trust, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. RCT I and RCT II were formed for the purposes of providing debt financing to the Company. The Company completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is the primary beneficiary of each of the trusts and determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of either trust because it does not have the power to direct the activities most significant to the trusts, which include the collection of principal and interest through servicing rights. Accordingly, neither trust is consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company records its investments in RCT I and RCT II s common shares of each as investments in unconsolidated entities using the cost method, recording dividend income when declared by RCT I and RCT II. The trusts each hold subordinated debentures for which the Company is the obligor in the amount of million for each of RCT I and RCT II. The debentures were funded by the issuance of trust preferred securities of RCT I and RCT II. 65 E. Wacker Joint Venture, LLC In March 2024, the Company contributed its interest in an East North Central office property to form a joint venture (the "Wacker JV") with an unrelated third-party ("Wacker Managing Member") for the purpose of converting the office property to multifamily units. At the date of contribution, the office property had a fair value of million. The Wacker Managing Member is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Wacker JV, but the Company and the Wacker Managing Member must each approve all major decisions related to the operations, financing or disposition of the Wacker JV before any major decision can be taken. The Company accounts for its investment in the Wacker JV as an equity method investment within investments in unconsolidated entities in its consolidated financial statements. 7720 McCallum JV, LLC In September 2024, the Company contributed as well as its net interest in a multifamily unit property located in the Southwest region to form a joint venture (the "McCallum JV") with an unrelated third-party ("McCallum Managing Member"). The McCallum Managing Member is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the McCallum JV. The Company determined McCallum JV to be a VIE for which it was not the primary beneficiary because it did not have the power to direct the activities most significant to the McCallum JV, as the Company does not have unilateral kick-out rights or substantive participating rights. The Company accounts for its investment in the McCallum JV as an equity method investment within investments in unconsolidated entities in its consolidated financial statements. Upon formation of the McCallum JV, the McCallum JV took ownership of the multifamily property subject to a related CRE loan payable to the Company which was novated to allow the McCallum JV to replace the original obligor who was experiencing financial difficulty. The million CRE loan has an initial maturity date of and bears interest at a rate of one-month Term SOFR and a spread of . There were no other changes to the terms of the loan. McCallum JV also entered into a million mezzanine loan commitment with the Company. amounts were funded under this commitment at September 30, 2024.

Allowance for credit losses at end of period 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a reversal of expected credit losses of , primarily attributable to a decrease in modeled credit risk resulting from payoffs and net improvements in property-level performance, offset by a minor worsening of macroeconomic factors, which in turn is keeping interest rates higher for longer. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, provisions of expected credit losses in the first and second quarters of 2024 outpaced the reversal during the third quarter of 2024, resulting in a net provision of million , primarily driven by worsening macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, higher interest rates lasting longer than expected pressuring CRE pricing, offset, in part, by a decrease in modeled credit risk resulting from payoffs and net improvements in property-level performance. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company individually evaluated the following loan for impairment: An office mezzanine loan in the Northeast region with a principal balance of million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company fully reserved this loan in the fourth quarter of 2022, and it continues to be fully reserved at September 30, 2024. The loan entered payment default in February 2023 and has been placed on nonaccrual status. 

 In fiscal year 2024, the Company individually evaluated one additional loan for which a resolution was reached: multifamily loan in the Southeast region, with a principal balance of million for which foreclosure was determined to be probable. In August 2024, the Company foreclosed on the loan. 

 At December 31, 2023, the Company had individually evaluated three additional loans for which resolutions were reached in fiscal year 2024: A retail loan in the Northeast region, with a principal balance of million at December 31, 2023, for which foreclosure was determined to be probable. The loan was modified in February 2021 to extend its maturity to December 2021. In December 2021, this loan entered payment default and was placed on nonaccrual status. The borrower filed for bankruptcy in 2023 and the property was sold to a third-party bidder at auction in February 2024. The sale closed in April 2024 at a purchase price of million and the loan was paid off at par. 

 An office loan in the East North Central region with a principal balance of million at December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the loan entered into payment default and was placed on nonaccrual status. The loan had an as-is appraised value in excess of its principal and interest balances, and, as such, had no allowance for CECL at December 31, 2023. In March 2024, the Company accepted the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full satisfaction of the loan and recognized a million gain upon conversion of the loan to real estate owned based on the property's fair value of million as determined by a current appraisal. Upon receipt, the property was immediately contributed to a joint venture with an independent third party at its aforementioned fair value, and the Company's investment in that joint venture is included in investments in unconsolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 3).

 million at December 31, 2023 for which foreclosure was determined to be probable. The loan had an initial maturity of March 2022 and was modified three times to extend its maturity to June 2022. The loan entered into payment default and was placed on nonaccrual status. However, in exchange for payments, comprising principal paydowns, interest payments and the reimbursement of certain legal fees, received between October 2022 and May 2024, the Company agreed to temporarily defer its right to foreclose on the property. In July 2024, the Company foreclosed on the loan. At the time of foreclosure, the loan had a principal balance of million. 

 Credit quality indicators Commercial Real Estate Loans CRE loans are collateralized by a diversified mix of real estate properties and are assessed for credit quality based on the collective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, time since origination, current implied and/or re-underwritten loan-to-collateral value ("LTV") ratios, loan structure and exit plan. Depending on the loan s performance against these various factors, loans are rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with loans rated 1 representing loans with the highest credit quality and loans rated 5 representing loans with the lowest credit quality. Loans are typically rated a 2 at origination. The factors evaluated provide general criteria to monitor credit migration in the Company s loan portfolio; as such, a loan s rating may improve or worsen, depending on new information received.

Because taxable income differs from cash flow from operations due to non-cash revenues or expenses (such as provisions for loan and lease losses and depreciation) and tax loss carryforwards, in certain circumstances the Company may generate operating cash flow in excess of its distributions or, alternatively, may be required to borrow funds to make sufficient distribution payments.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 References in this quarterly report to "we," "us" or the "Company" refer to ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 
 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as "may," "will," "continue," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "look forward" or other similar words or terms. Because such statements include risks, uncertainties and contingencies, actual results may differ materially from the expectations, intentions, beliefs, plans or predictions of the future expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, factors impacting whether we will be able to maintain our sources of liquidity and whether we will be able to identify sufficient suitable investments to increase our originations, please refer to the Risk Factors section of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Overview 
 We are a Maryland corporation and an externally managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") that is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing commercial real estate ("CRE") mortgage loans and equity investments in commercial real estate properties through direct ownership and joint ventures. Our manager is ACRES Capital, LLC (our "Manager"), a subsidiary of ACRES Capital Corp. (collectively, "ACRES"), a private commercial real estate lender exclusively dedicated to nationwide middle market CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student housing, hospitality, office and industrial properties in top United States ("U.S.") markets. Our Manager draws upon the management team of ACRES and its collective investment experience to provide its services. Our longer term objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time, including quarterly distributions and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our investment strategies as well as to maximize long-term stockholder value by maintaining stability through our available liquidity and diversified CRE loan portfolio. Our short term strategy is to drive book value ("BV") growth over the coming years by utilizing our NOL carryforwards of 32.1 million and a portion of our net capital loss carryforwards of 121.9 million, each at September 30, 2024. By retaining future earnings, we can grow our investable base and selectively deploy the anticipated capital growth into new whole loan originations at attractive yields, which we expect will grow our earnings available for distribution. 
 Currently, markets are grappling with inflation and the prospect of having higher interest rates for longer than originally forecasted. These market pressures have caused continued disruption in many market segments, including the financial services, real estate and credit markets and these disruptions have affected the availability and the cost of capital. The increase in the cost of capital is expected to cause dislocations in various investment and financing markets in which we participate as we and other market participants adjust to the new financing environment. 
 The U.S. Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate by 5.25 in 11 rate hikes between March 2022 and July 2023 to combat inflation. While the U.S Federal Reserve has lowered rates in September 2024, there is no certainty with respect to the timing and pace of potential future decreases or if such decreases will continue to occur. Interest rates may remain at or near recent highs, which creates further uncertainty for the economy and our borrowers. A rising interest rate environment generally correlates to increases in our net income. However, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our existing borrowers and could lead to nonperformance, i.e. the borrower s inability to pay debt service. Lowering rates and decreasing costs may encourage consumer spending and accelerate corporate profit growth, which may positively impact the collateral underlying our loans and positively impact our borrowers' ability to sell or refinance in the current market. 
 Additionally, the office property market continues to experience high vacancies, slower leasing activity and current tenants reevaluating their needs for physical office space due to remote-work trends across the country. These factors, coupled with inflation, historically higher interest rates and dislocations in market liquidity, have converged to create higher levels of uncertainty surrounding property values, which in turn, also negatively impact borrowers' ability and willingness to financially support and standby their 
 (Back to Index) 41 

(Back to Index) 

 investments in their office properties, their abilities to sell or refinance their positions in the current market and ultimately our financial results. 
 In response, we continue to manage corporate liquidity actively and responsibly, manage our CRE assets through a solutions-based approach with our borrowers and manage our daily operations in light of changing macroeconomic circumstances. Our Manager also continuously monitors for new capital opportunities and selectively executes on agreements that are expected to enhance our returns. 
 We originate transitional floating-rate CRE loans with a target size between 10.0 million and 100.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not originate any new floating-rate CRE loans. Loan payoffs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 270.1 million, along with loan foreclosures of 37.7 million, offset by net funded commitments of 28.1 million, producing a net decrease to the portfolio of 279.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we selectively originated three floating-rate CRE whole loans with total commitments of 68.2 million. Loan payoffs during the year ended December 31, 2023 were 293.1 million, offset by net funded commitments of 40.5 million, producing a net decrease to the portfolio of 184.4 million. 
 Our CRE loan portfolio, which had carrying values of 1.5 billion and 1.8 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, comprised: 
 First mortgage loans, which we refer to as whole loans. These loans are typically secured by first liens on CRE property, including the following property types: multifamily, student housing, hospitality, office, self-storage and retail. All but four of our CRE whole loans were current on contractual payments at September 30, 2024. 

Mezzanine debt that is senior to borrower s equity but is subordinated to other third-party debt. These loans are subordinated CRE loans, usually secured by a pledge of the borrower s equity ownership in the entity that owns the property or by a second lien mortgage on the property. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had one mezzanine loan included in CRE loans held for investment that had no carrying value. This mezzanine loan was not current on contractual payments at September 30, 2024. 

We generate our income primarily from the spread between the revenues we receive from our assets and the cost to finance our ownership of those assets, including corporate debt. 
 While the CRE whole loans included in the CRE loan portfolio are substantially composed of floating-rate loans benchmarked to the one-month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR"), asset yields are protected through the use of benchmark floors and minimum interest periods that typically range from 12 to 18 months at the time of a loan s origination. Our benchmark floors provide asset yield protection when the benchmark rate falls below an in-place benchmark floor. Our net investment returns are enhanced by a decline in the cost of our floating-rate liabilities that do not have benchmark floors. Our net investment returns will be negatively impacted by the rising cost of our floating-rate liabilities that do not have floors until the benchmark rate is above the benchmark floor, at which point our floating-rate loans and floating-rate liabilities will be match-funded, effectively locking in our net interest margin until the benchmark floor rate is activated again or the floating-rate loan is paid off or refinanced. 
 In a business environment where benchmark rates are increasing significantly, cash flows of the CRE assets underlying our loans may not be sufficient to pay debt service on our loans, which could result in non-performance or default. We partially mitigate this risk by generally requiring our borrowers to purchase interest rate cap agreements with non-affiliated, well-capitalized third parties and by selectively requiring our borrowers to have and maintain debt service reserves. These interest rate caps generally mature prior to the maturity date of the loan and the borrowers are required to pay to extend them. In certain cases, the sponsors will need to fund additional equity into the properties to cover these costs as the property may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay these costs. At September 30, 2024, 76 of the par value of our CRE loan portfolio had interest rate caps or funded debt service reserves in place with a weighted-average maturity of six months. 
 At September 30, 2024, our par-value 1.6 billion floating-rate CRE loan portfolio had a weighted average benchmark floor of 0.85 , while at December 31, 2023, this floor was 0.70 . With the historical trend of rising benchmark rates, we have seen the coupons on all of our floating-rate assets and debt rise accordingly. Because we have equity invested in each floating-rate loan, and because in all instances the benchmark interest rates are above our loan floors, the rise in interest rates resulted in an increase in our net interest income, which was offset due to the decrease in our floating-rate CRE loan portfolio. See "Interest Rate Risk" in "Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."

 Our portfolio comprises loans with a diverse array of collateral types and locations. Multifamily continues to comprise the majority of our portfolio, with 79.4 of our portfolio allocated to multifamily at September 30, 2024 and 79.6 at December 31, 2023. The following charts show our portfolio allocation by property type at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 From time to time, we may acquire real estate property through direct equity investments or as a result of our lending activities. During the first quarter of 2024, we acquired an office property located in the East North Central region via deed-in-lieu of foreclosure that, at acquisition, had a cost basis of 14.0 million and a fair value of 20.3 million. We recognized a 5.8 million gain upon converting the loan to real estate owned and immediately contributed the property into a joint venture with an unrelated third-party, seeking to maximize the property's value through a multifamily conversion. In the third quarter of 2024, we acquired a multifamily property in the Southwest region via foreclosure that, at acquisition, had a cost basis of 30.9 million. No gain or loss was recognized upon conversion of the CRE loan to real estate investment owned, and the property was immediately contributed to a joint venture with an unrelated third-party. We reported this investment as an investment in an unconsolidated entity on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. Additionally, we acquired two properties via foreclosure in the third quarter of 2024 that are held as investments in real estate. The first is an office complex located in the Southwest region that, at acquisition, had a fair value of 17.5 million. We recognized a 2.8 million net unrealized gain upon converting the CRE loan to real estate owned. The second acquisition is a multi-family property located in the Southeast region with a cost basis of 9.4 million. No gain or loss occurred upon conversion of the CRE loan to real estate owned. 
 At September 30, 2024, the net carrying value of our net real estate-related assets and liabilities was 194.5 million on eight properties owned, four of which are included in investments in real estate and four of which are included in properties held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets. The existence of net capital loss carryforwards available until December 31, 2025 allows for potential future capital gains on certain of these investments to be shielded from income taxes. 
 We use leverage to enhance our returns. The cost of borrowings to finance our investments is a significant part of our expenses. Our net interest income depends on our ability to control these expenses relative to our revenue. Our CRE loans may initially be financed with term facilities, such as CRE loan warehouse financing facilities, in anticipation of their ultimate securitization. We ultimately seek to finance our CRE loans through the use of non-recourse long-term, match-funded CRE debt securitizations. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our financing arrangements were as follows (dollars in thousands):

 We reevaluate our current expected credit losses ("CECL") allowance quarterly, incorporating our current expectations of macroeconomic factors considered in the determination of our CECL reserves. At September 30, 2024, the CECL allowance on our CRE loan portfolio was 34.7 million, or 2.2 of our 1.6 billion loan portfolio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net provision for credit losses primarily attributable to worsening macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, higher interest rates lasting longer than expected pressuring CRE pricing, offset, in part, by a decrease in modeled credit risk resulting from payoffs and net improvements in property-level performance. 
 At December 31, 2023, the CECL allowance on our CRE loan portfolio was 28.8 million or 1.5 of our 1.9 billion loan portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a provision for credit losses primarily attributable to the modeled increases in general portfolio credit risk compounded by ongoing uncertainty around the commercial real estate market s current macroeconomic outlook, which affected our borrowers business plan execution and general market liquidity. In June 2023, we received the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure to a property formerly collateralizing an office loan in the East North Central region with a principal balance of 22.8 million, which resulted in a charge off of 948,000 against the allowance for credit losses. 
 Additionally, the decline in our CECL reserves from our highest reserve balance at June 30, 2020 of 61.1 million, or 3.4 of the par balance of our CRE loan portfolio, to our current reserve balance at September 30, 2024 of 34.7 million, or 2.2 of the par balance of our CRE loan portfolio, has been due to the following: the successful resolution of our individually evaluated loans with specific reserves, the overall newer vintage of our CRE loan portfolio (with only 8.6 of the portfolio, at September 30, 2024, being originated prior to the fourth quarter of 2020) as well as the increased percentage allocation of our CRE loan portfolio to multifamily loans over time. Multifamily loans have historically had the lowest credit losses of any asset class, and our percentage allocation of our CRE loan portfolio to multifamily has grown from 58.4 at June 30, 2020 to 79.4 at September 30, 2024. 
 Common stock book value was 27.92 per share at September 30, 2024, a 1.27 per share increase from December 31, 2023. 
 Results of Operations 
 Our net income allocable to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.8 million or 0.37 per share-basic 0.36 per share-diluted) as compared to net income allocable to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 2.9 million or 0.34 per share-basic 0.33 per share-diluted). Our net income allocable to common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.0 million, or 0.65 per share-basic 0.63 per share-diluted), as compared to net income allocable to common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 1.3 million, or 0.15 per share-basic 0.15 per share-diluted).

Net Change in Interest Income for the Comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Aggregate interest income decreased by 8.9 million and 17.7 million for the comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We attribute the change to the following: 
 CRE whole loans. The decrease of 8.9 million for the comparative three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in total par value of our CRE portfolio resulting from loan payoffs and foreclosures and the benchmark rate over the comparative period. The decrease of 17.5 million for the comparative nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in total par value of our CRE portfolio, offset, in part, by an increase in the benchmark rate over the comparative period. 
 Other. The decrease of 52,000 and 237,000 for the comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was primarily attributable to a decrease in restricted cash in our CRE securitizations, offset, in part, by an increase in yields on our interest earning money market accounts. 
 Net Change in Interest Expense for the Comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Aggregate interest expense decreased by 4.7 million and 7.0 million for the comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We attribute the change to the following: 
 Securitized borrowings. The net decrease of 3.2 million and 2.0 million for the comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was primarily attributable to paydowns on our borrowings, offset, in part, by an increase in the benchmark rate over the comparative periods. 
 Senior secured financing facility. The increase of 258,000 and 669,000 for the comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was primarily attributable to an increase in borrowings and the benchmark rate over the comparative periods. 
 CRE - term warehouse financing facilities. The decrease of 1.8 million and 5.9 million for the comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were primarily attributable to paydowns on our borrowings. 
 Unsecured junior subordinated debentures. The increase of 5,000 and 189,000 for the comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was primarily attributable to an increase in the benchmark rate over the comparative periods.

Aggregate real estate income and other revenue increased by 2.5 million and 4.1 million for the comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in the comparative three and nine months was attributed to: (i) incremental increase in revenues from the acquisition of an office building through deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in June 2023, and asset acquisitions in the third quarter of 2024 of a multifamily property and an office property through foreclosures, (ii) increased revenues from a hotel property that had increased occupancy and rental rates for both the comparative three and nine month periods and (iii) an increase in revenue related to a student housing property that completed construction and became operational in August 2024.

The increase in general and administrative expense for the comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase related to the increase in professional services due to timing of the audit expense accrual. 
 Real estate expenses. The increase of 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to (i) an increase in expenses related to a student housing property that completed construction and became operational in August 2024 and (ii) an incremental increase in expenses from the acquisition of an office building through deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in June 2023, and asset acquisitions in the third quarter of 2024 of a multifamily property and an office property through deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. 
 Provision for credit losses. The decrease in the provision for credit losses of 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily driven by a decrease in modeled credit risk for improved property performance and loan payoffs offset by an increase in reserves from macroeconomic factors this quarter. Please refer to the "Financing Receivables" section for more information on our provision for credit losses.

 Aggregate other income increased 2.8 million and 9.1 million for the comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We attribute the change to the following: 
 Gain on sale of real estate . The decrease of 745,000 during the comparative nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily attributed to the sale of a hotel property in the Northeast region in February 2023 that generated a non-recurring gain of 745,000. No sales of real estate occurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Gain on conversion of real estate. The increase of 2.8 million and 8.6 million during the comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was primarily attributed to the completion of one deed-in-lieu of foreclosure that generated a non-recurring gain of 5.8 million, in the first quarter of 2024, and a foreclosure in the third quarter of 2024 that generated an unrealized gain of 2.8 million, as the fair value of the properties exceeded the amortized cost basis of the loans. 
 Other Income. The increase of 1.4 million during the comparative nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is primarily attributed to the reversal of warranty reserves and representations related to a discontinued residential lending business.

Financing Receivables 
 Current market conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a dislocation in capital markets, declining real estate values of certain asset classes and increased delinquencies and defaults, resulting in increased loan modifications, increased allowances for credit losses and an increased risk to borrowers of foreclosure actions. We routinely employ rigorous risk management and underwriting practices to proactively evaluate and maintain the credit quality of our CRE loan portfolio and work closely with our borrowers to mitigate potential losses. 
 	The following tables show the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a reversal of expected credit losses of 291,000, primarily attributable to a decrease in modeled credit risk resulting from payoffs and net improvements in property-level performance, offset by a minor worsening of macroeconomic factors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, provisions of expected credit losses in the first and second quarters of 2024 outpaced the reversal during the third quarter of 2024, resulting in a net provision of 5.9 million, primarily driven by worsening macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, higher interest rates lasting longer than expected pressuring CRE pricing, offset, in part, by a decrease in modeled credit risk resulting from payoffs and net improvements in property-level performance. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we individually evaluated the following loan for impairment: 
 An office mezzanine loan in the Northeast region with a principal balance of 4.7 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We fully reserved this loan in the fourth quarter of 2022, and it continues to be fully reserved at September 30, 2024. The loan entered payment default in February 2023 and has been placed on nonaccrual status. 

In fiscal year 2024, we individually evaluated one additional loan for which a resolution was reached: 
 A multifamily loan in the Southeast region, with a principal balance of 9.3 million for which foreclosure was determined to be probable. In August 2024, we foreclosed on the loan. 

At December 31, 2023, we individually evaluated three additional loans for which resolutions were reached in fiscal year 2024: 
 A retail loan in the Northeast region, with a principal balance of 8.0 million at December 31, 2023, for which foreclosure was determined to be probable. The loan was modified in February 2021 to extend its maturity to December 2021. In December 2021, this loan entered payment default and was placed on nonaccrual status. The borrower filed for bankruptcy in 2023 and the property was sold to a third-party bidder at auction in February 2024. The sale closed in April 2024, at a purchase price of 8.3 million and the loan was paid off at par. 

An office loan in the East North Central region with a principal balance of 14.0 million at December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the loan entered into payment default and was placed on nonaccrual status. The loan had an "as-is" appraised value in excess of its principal and interest balances, and, as such, had no allowance for CECL at December 31, 2023. In March 2024, we accepted the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in full satisfaction of the loan and recognized a 5.8 million gain in the consolidated statement of operations upon conversion of the loan to real estate owned based on the property's fair value of 20.3 million as determined by a current appraisal. Upon receipt, the property was immediately contributed to a joint venture with an independent third party at its aforementioned fair value, and our investment in that joint venture is included in investments in unconsolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheet. 

An office loan in the Southwest region, with a principal balance of 19.1 million at December 31, 2023, for which foreclosure was determined to be probable. The loan had an initial maturity of March 2022 and was modified three times to extend its maturity to June 2022. The loan entered into payment default and was placed on nonaccrual status. However, in exchange for payments, comprising principal paydowns, interest payments and the reimbursement of certain legal fees, received between October 2022 and May 2024, we agreed to temporarily defer our right to foreclose on the property. In July 2024, we foreclosed on the loan. At the time of foreclosure, the loan had a principal balance of 14.4 million.

 Credit quality indicators 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans 
 CRE loans are collateralized by a diversified mix of real estate properties and are assessed for credit quality based on the collective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, time since origination, current implied and/or re-underwritten loan-to-collateral value ("LTV") ratios, loan structure and exit plan. Depending on the loan s performance against these various factors, loans are rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with loans rated 1 representing loans with the highest credit quality and loans rated 5 representing loans with the lowest credit quality. Loans are typically rated a 2 at origination. The factors evaluated provide general criteria to monitor credit migration in our loan portfolio; as such, a loan s rating may improve or worsen, depending on new information received. 
 The criteria set forth below should be used as general guidelines and, therefore, not every loan will have all of the characteristics described in each category below.

An updated appraisal is required upon designation and updated on an as-needed basis. 

All CRE loans are evaluated for any credit deterioration by debt asset management and certain finance personnel on at least a quarterly basis. Mezzanine loans may experience greater credit risks due to their nature as subordinated investments. 
 For the purpose of calculating the quarterly provision for credit losses under CECL, we pool CRE loans based on the underlying collateral property type and utilize a probability of default and loss given default methodology for approximately one year after which we immediately revert to a historical mean loss ratio. 
 Credit risk profiles of CRE loans at amortized cost were as follows (in thousands, except amounts in the footnotes):

(1) The total amortized cost of CRE loans excluded accrued interest receivable of 13.9 million and 11.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

(2) Fully reserved at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had four and three CRE whole loans, with total amortized costs of 94.4 million and 41.2 million, respectively, and one mezzanine loan, with a total amortized cost of 4.7 million, in payment default. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized interest income of 204,000 and 338,000, respectively, on one CRE whole loan that was placed on nonaccrual status. In both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized interest income of 335,000 on two CRE whole loans that were placed on nonaccrual status. 
 Loan Modifications 
 We are required to disclose modifications where we determined the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and modified the agreement to: (i) forgive principal, (ii) reduce the interest rate, (iii) cause an other-than-insignificant payment delay, (iv) extend the loan term, or (v) any combination thereof. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into the following three loan modifications that required disclosure: 
 A multifamily loan with an amortized cost of 53.0 million, representing 3.4 of the total amortized cost of the portfolio, was modified to: (i) extend its maturity from June 2025 to June 2026, (ii) reduce its current interest rate from one-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 3.70 to one-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 1.70 , and (iii) defer interest of 2.00 that will be due at payoff. In connection with the modification, the borrower funded additional capital into the project for interest reserves to cover debt service. 

A multifamily loan with an amortized cost of 44.4 million, representing 2.8 of the total amortized cost of the portfolio, was modified to: (i) reduce its current pay interest rate from one-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 3.31 to a 5.00 fixed rate and (ii) defer the unpaid interest that will be due at loan payoff. In connection with the modification, the borrower funded additional capital into the project for interest reserves to cover debt service. 

A multifamily loan with an amortized cost of 70.7 million, representing 4.5 of the total amortized cost of the portfolio, was modified to: (i) extend its maturity from January 2025 to January 2026 and (ii) provide for 2.00 per annum of the interest rate to be deferred until payoff. We also entered into a mezzanine loan with a total commitment of 6.0 million, of which 3.0 million was funded as of September 30, 2024. The loan has a fixed rate of 15.00 that accrues and will be due at payoff in January 2026. In connection with the modification, the borrower renewed the interest rate cap. 

These loans were performing in accordance with the modified contractual terms as of September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, two of these loans, with a total amortized cost of 123.7 million, had a risk rating of "4" and one loan, with an amortized cost of 44.4 million, had a risk rating of "3". Loans with a risk rating of "3" and "4" are included in the determination of our general CECL reserves.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not enter into any loan modifications for borrowers that were experiencing financial difficulty. 
 Restricted Cash 
 At September 30, 2024, we had restricted cash of 961,000 held in escrow for deposits or tax payments at our real estate properties or pledged with minimum reserve balance requirements. At December 31, 2023, we had restricted cash of 8.4 million, which consisted of 7.6 million held in reserve for a construction loan, and 800,000 held in escrow for deposits or tax payments at our real estate properties or pledged with minimum reserve balance requirements. The decrease of 7.5 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in restricted cash at our investments in real estate that was used to fund planned construction.

The increase of 2.4 million in other assets was primarily attributable to increases in various receivables and prepaid accounts held at our real estate properties, offset by amortization. 
 Deferred Tax Assets 
 At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our net deferred tax asset was zero, resulting from a full valuation allowance of 21.4 million and 21.1 million, respectively, on our gross deferred tax asset as we believed it was more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. We will continue to evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carry back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. 
 Derivative Instruments 
 Historically, we sought to mitigate the potential impact on net income (loss) of adverse fluctuations in interest rates incurred on our borrowings by entering into hedging agreements. We classified our interest rate hedges as cash flow hedges, which are hedges that eliminate the risk of changes in the cash flows of a financial asset or liability.

 We terminated interest rate swap positions associated with our prior financed CMBS portfolio in April 2020. At termination, we realized a loss of 11.8 million. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a loss of 3.7 million and 5.0 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is being amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the debt. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded amortization expense of 425,000 and 1.3 million, respectively, reported in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded amortization expense of 425,000 and 1.3 million, respectively, reported in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had unrealized gains of 96,000 and 164,000, respectively, attributable to two terminated interest rate swaps, in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets, to be accreted into earnings over the remaining life of the debt. During both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded accretion income, reported in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations, of 23,000, to accrete the accumulated other comprehensive income on the terminated swap agreements. For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded accretion income, reported in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations, of 69,000 and 68,000, respectively, to accrete the accumulated other comprehensive income on the terminated swap agreements.

 We were in compliance with all covenants in the respective agreements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Senior Secured Financing Facility 
 In July 2020, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ours ("Holdings"), along with its direct wholly-owned subsidiary (the "Borrower"), entered into a 250.0 million loan and servicing agreement (the "MassMutual Loan Agreement") with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company ("MassMutual") and the other lenders party thereto (the "Lenders") to form an asset-based revolving loan facility ("MassMutual Facility") to finance our core CRE lending business. The MassMutual Facility initially had an interest rate of 5.75 per annum payable monthly and initially matured on July 31, 2027. 
 In December 2022, Holdings, the Borrower and the Lenders entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Servicing Agreement, which amends and restates the MassMutual Loan Agreement, and reflects a senior secured term loan facility, not to exceed 500.0 million, composed of individual loan series issued upon mutual agreement of the Borrower and Lenders. Each loan series will be available for three months after the closing date agreed upon by the Borrower and Lender ("Commitment Period"), subject to the maximum dollar amount agreed upon for that series. The Commitment Period is subject to immediate termination upon the occurrence of an event of default. Each loan series will have a final maturity of five years from the issuance date for the loan series unless an additional time is mutually agreed upon by the Lenders and Borrower. The advance rate on portfolio assets will be mutually agreed upon by the Lenders and Borrower. Each loan series will have its own mutually agreed upon interest rate equal to one-month Term SOFR plus the applicable spread. 
 CRE - Term Warehouse Financing Facilities 
 In October 2018, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ours entered into a master repurchase agreement (the "JPMorgan Chase Facility") with JP Morgan Chase to finance the origination of CRE loans. As amended, the JPMorgan Chase Facility has a maximum facility amount of 250.0 million, charges interest of one-month benchmark plus market spreads and has a maturity date of July 2026. 
 In November 2021, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ours entered into a master repurchase and securities contract agreement (the "Morgan Stanley Facility") with Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC ("Morgan Stanley") to finance the origination of CRE loans. As amended, the Morgan Stanley Facility has a maximum facility amount of 250.0 million, charges interest of one-month Term SOFR plus market spreads and matures in November 2024. We also have the right to request a one-year extension. In November 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to Guaranty (the Morgan Stanley Amendment by and between us and Morgan Stanley, which makes certain amendments and modifications to the Guaranty, dated November 3, 2021 between us and Morgan Stanley as amended (the MS Guaranty including but not limited to amending the EBITDA to Interest Expense ratio (as defined in the MS Guaranty) through the quarter ending December 2025 and extending the Morgan Stanley Facility to November 2025. See Part II, Item 5 "Other Information". 
 Mortgages Payable 
 In April 2022, Chapel Drive West, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Charles Street ACRES FSU Student Venture, LLC entered into a Loan Agreement (the "Mortgage") with Readycap Commercial, LLC ("Readycap") to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex. The Mortgage is interest only and has a maximum principal balance of 20.4 million, of which, 18.7 million was advanced in the initial funding. The Mortgage charges interest of one-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 3.80 and matures in April 2025, subject to two one-year extension options. 
 The Mortgage contains events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type of financing arrangement. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction. 
 In January 2023, Chapel Drive East, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the FSU Student Venture, entered into a loan agreement (the "Construction Loan Agreement") with Oceanview Life and Annuity Company ("Oceanview") to finance the construction of a student housing complex (the "Construction Loan"). The Construction Loan is interest only and has a maximum principal balance of 48.0 million. The Construction Loan charges one-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 6.00 and matures in February 2025, subject to three one-year extension options. 
 In addition to the Construction Loan, Chapel Drive East, LLC entered into a financing agreement with Florida Pace Funding Agency to fund energy efficient building improvements and has a maximum principal balance of 15.5 million.

 In connection with our investment in the student housing complex, ACRES RF entered into guarantees related to the Construction Loan. Pursuant to the guarantees, Jason Pollack, Frank Dellaglio and ACRES RF (collectively, the "Guarantors"), for the benefit of Oceanview, provided limited "bad boy" guaranties to Oceanview pursuant to the Construction Loan Agreement until the earlier of the payment in full of the indebtedness or the date of a sale of the property pursuant to a foreclosure of the mortgage or deed or other transfer in lieu of foreclosure is accepted by Oceanview. The Guarantors also entered into a Completion Guaranty Agreement for the benefit of Oceanview to guaranty the timely completion of the project in accordance with the Construction Loan Agreement, as well as a Carry Guaranty Agreement, for the benefit of Oceanview to guaranty unconditional payment by Chapel Drive East, LLC of all customary or necessary costs and expenses incurred in connection with the operation, maintenance and management of the property and an Environmental Indemnity Agreement jointly and severally in favor of Oceanview whereby the Guarantors provided environmental representations and warranties, covenants and indemnifications (collectively the "Guaranties"). The Guaranties include certain financial covenants required of ACRES RF, including required net worth and liquidity requirements. 
 Securitizations 
 At September 30, 2024, we retained equity in two CRE loan securitizations that we executed, as follows: 
 ACR 2021-FL1 
 In May 2021, we closed ACR 2021-FL1, an 802.6 million CRE debt securitization transaction that provided financing for CRE loans. ACR 2021-FL1 included a reinvestment period, which ended in May 2023, that allowed it to acquire CRE loans for reinvestment into the securitization using uninvested principal proceeds. ACR 2021-FL1 issued a total of 675.2 million of non-recourse, floating-rate notes to third parties at par. We retained 100 of the Class F and Class G notes in addition to 100 of the outstanding preference shares. The preference shares are subordinated in right of payment to all other securities issued by ACR 2021-FL1. All notes issued mature in June 2036, although we have the right to call the notes beginning on the payment date in May 2023 and thereafter. As of September 30, 2024, we had not exercised this right. 
 ACR 2021-FL2 
 In December 2021, we closed ACR 2021-FL2, a 700.0 million CRE debt securitization transaction that provided financing for CRE loans. ACR 2021-FL2 includes a reinvestment period, which ends in December 2023, that allows it to acquire CRE loans for reinvestment into the securitization using uninvested principal proceeds. ACR 2021-FL2 issued a total of 567.0 million of non-recourse, floating-rate notes to third parties at par. We retained 100 of the Class F and Class G notes in addition to 100 of the outstanding preference shares. The preference shares are subordinated in right of payment to all other securities issued by ACR 2021-FL2. All notes issued mature in January 2037, although we have the right to call the notes beginning on the payment date in December 2023 and thereafter. As of September 30, 2024, we had not exercised this right. 
 Corporate Debt 
 5.75 Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2026 
 On August 16, 2021, we issued 150.0 million of our 5.75 senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the "5.75 Senior Unsecured Notes") pursuant to our Indenture, dated August 16, 2021 (the "Base Indenture"), between Wells Fargo, now Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("CTC"), as trustee (the "Trustee"), and us as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated August 16, 2021, between Wells Fargo, now CTC, and us (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"). Prior to May 15, 2026, we may at our option redeem the 5.75 Senior Unsecured Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, and (ii) a make-whole premium. On or after May 15, 2026, we may at our option redeem the 5.75 Senior Unsecured Notes, at any time, in whole or in part, on not less than 15 days nor more than 60 days prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 5.75 Senior Unsecured Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 Unsecured Junior Subordinated Debentures 
 During 2006, we formed RCT I and RCT II for the sole purpose of issuing and selling capital securities representing preferred beneficial interests. RCT I and RCT II are not consolidated into our consolidated financial statements because we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these entities. In connection with the issuance and sale of the capital securities, we issued junior subordinated debentures to RCT I and RCT II of 25.8 million each, representing our maximum exposure to loss. The debt issuance costs associated with the junior subordinated debentures for RCT I and RCT II were included in borrowings and were amortized into interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations using the effective yield method over a ten year period.

(Back to Index) 

 There were no unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the junior subordinated debentures for RCT I and RCT II outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The interest rates for RCT I and RCT II, at September 30, 2024, were 9.54 and 9.47 , respectively. The interest rates for RCT I and RCT II, at December 31, 2023, were 9.61 and 9.60 , respectively. 
 Equity 
 Total equity at September 30, 2024 was 446.9 million compared to total equity at December 31, 2023 of 446.2 million. The increase in equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to current earnings offset by common stock and preferred stock repurchases and dividends on preferred stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our preferred equity is composed of the following at September 30, 2024: 
 4.8 million shares of 8.625 fixed to floating rate Series C cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a 25.00 per share liquidation preference ("Series C Preferred Stock"). The Series C Preferred Stock has no maturity date and we are not required to redeem it at any time. However, we may redeem it at our election, in whole or in apart, on or after July 30, 2024. Effective July 30, 2024, the Series C Preferred Stock converted from its fixed rate of 8.625 to a floating rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 5.927 , but at no time shall the floating rate be less than 8.625 . Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. 

4.5 million shares of fixed 7.875 Series D cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a 25.00 per share liquidation preference ("Series D Preferred Stock"). The Series D Preferred Stock has no maturity and we are not required to redeem it at any time. However, we may redeem it at our election, in whole or in apart, on or after May 21, 2026. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears.

The denominators for the calculations were 7,606,674 and 7,853,536 shares at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

(2) The per share amounts are calculated with the denominator referenced in footnote (1) at September 30, 2024. We calculated net income per common share-diluted of 0.36 and 0.63, respectively, using the weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

(3) In November 2021, our Board authorized and approved the continued use of our existing share repurchase program to repurchase up to 20.0 million of our outstanding common stock. In November 2023, an additional 10.0 million of outstanding shares of both common and preferred stock was authorized. We purchased 2.4 million common shares for 25.5 million and 100,000 preferred shares for 2.2 million through September 30, 2024. Because we repurchased our common stock at significant discounts to book value, these repurchases were accretive to per share book value since the inception of the program. 

(4) We calculated common stock book value as total stockholders equity of 436.3 million less preferred stock equity of 224.0 million at September 30, 2024. 

Management Agreement Equity 
 Our monthly base management fee, as defined in our Management Agreement, is equal to 1/12 of the amount of our equity multiplied by 1.50 and is calculated and paid monthly in arrears.

Earnings Available for Distribution 
 Earnings Available for Distribution ("EAD") is a non-GAAP financial measure intended to supplement our financial results computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), and we believe EAD serves as a useful indicator for investors in evaluating our performance and ability to pay dividends. 
 EAD excludes the effects of certain transactions and adjustments in accordance with GAAP that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current CRE loan portfolio and other CRE-related investments and operations. EAD excludes income (loss) from all non-core assets such as commercial finance, residential mortgage lending, certain legacy CRE loans and other non-CRE assets designated as assets held for sale at the initial measurement date of December 31, 2016. 
 EAD, for reporting purposes, is defined as GAAP net income (loss) allocable to common shares, excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) unrealized gains and losses, (iii) non-cash provisions for credit losses, (iv) non-cash impairments on securities, (v) non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings, (vi) net income or loss from a limited partnership interest owned at the initial measurement date, (vii) net income or loss from non-core assets, (viii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (ix) foreign currency gains or losses and (x) income or loss from discontinued operations. EAD may also be adjusted periodically to exclude certain one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash items. 
 Although pursuant to the Management Agreement we calculate incentive compensation using EAD that excludes incentive compensation payable to our Manager, we include incentive compensation payable to our Manager in calculating EAD for reporting purposes.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, EAD in accordance with the Management Agreement, which excludes incentive compensation payable, was 1.9 million and 7.2 million, respectively, or 0.24 and 0.91, respectively, per common share outstanding. There was no incentive compensation payable incurred by us for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Incentive Compensation Hurdle 
 With respect to each fiscal quarter commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2022, an incentive management fee calculated and payable in arrears in an amount, not less than zero, equal to: 
 (i) for the first full calendar quarter ended December 31, 2022, the product of (a) 20 and (b) the excess of (i) our EAD (as defined in the Management Agreement) for such calendar quarter, over (ii) the product of (A) our book value equity (as defined in the Management Agreement) as of the end of such calendar quarter, and (B) 7 per annum; 

(ii) for each of the second, third and fourth full calendar quarters following the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2022 , the excess of (1) the product of (a) 20 and (b) the excess of (i) our EAD (as defined in the Management Agreement) for the calendar quarter(s) following September 30, 2022, over (ii) the product of (A) our book value equity (as defined in the Management Agreement) in the calendar quarter(s) following September 30, 2022, and (B) 7 per annum, over (2) the sum of any incentive compensation paid to our Manager with respect to the prior calendar quarter(s) following September 30, 2022 (other than the most recent calendar quarter); and

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was no incentive compensation payable to the Manager. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to pay dividends, fund investments, repay borrowings and provide for other general business needs, including payment of our base management fee and incentive compensation. Our ability to meet our on-going liquidity needs is subject to our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which was 18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and our ability to maintain and/or obtain additional debt financing and equity capital together with the funds referred to below. 
 At September 30, 2024, our liquidity consisted of 70.1 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and 9.6 million of potential proceeds from unlevered financeable CRE loans. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were: (i) proceeds of 31.1 million from our mortgages payable; (ii) net proceeds of 19.5 million from repayments on our CRE portfolio; and (iii) proceeds of 19.3 million from advances from our term warehouse financing facilities. 
 These sources of liquidity were offset by our paydowns on our term warehouse facilities, deployments in CRE whole loans and real estate investments, repurchases of common and preferred stock, distributions on our preferred stock and ongoing operating expenses and substantially resulted in the 70.1 million of unrestricted cash we held at September 30, 2024. 
 The outstanding balance of our loan to ACRES Capital Corp., the parent of our Manager, was 10.8 million and 11.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The note bears interest at 3.00 per annum, payable monthly, and matures in July 2026, subject to two one-year extensions, at ACRES Capital Corp. s option, and amortizes at a rate of 25,000 per month. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance decreased 20.9 million to 71.0 million. The cash movements can be summarized by the following: 
 Cash flows from operating activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities increased our cash balances by 18.6 million, primarily driven by net income after removing non-cash gain on conversion of real estate, non-cash provision for loan losses, non-cash amortization and depreciation, and net changes in other assets and liabilities. 
 (Back to Index) 66 

(Back to Index) 

 Cash flows from investing activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investing activities increased our cash balances by 174.6 million, primarily driven by repayments of CRE loans, partially offset by funding of existing commitments on CRE whole loans and deployments in our investment in real estate. 
 Cash flows from financing activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities decreased our cash balances by 214.1 million, primarily driven by repayments on our CRE securitization notes and distributions on our preferred stock and repurchases of our common stock and preferred stock and on our term warehouse financing facilities, partially offset by proceeds from financing on our investments in real estate and term warehouse financing facilities. 
 
 Financing Availability 
 We utilize a variety of financing arrangements to finance certain assets. We generally utilize the following types of financing arrangements: 
 1. Senior Secured Financing Facility: Our senior secured financing facility allows us to borrow against loans and real estate investments that we own. This facility has an individual floating rate loan series structure that have a three month commitment period after the financing is approved by the lender, subject to the maximum dollar amount agreed upon for the series. Each floating rate loan series will have mutually agreed upon terms including (i) total commitment, including the capacity to fund future funding commitments, where applicable; (ii) advance rate on portfolio assets; (iii) interest rate composed of one-month Term SOFR plus a market rate spread; and (iv) maturity date of five years from the issuance date for the loan series unless an additional time is mutually agreed upon by the parties. The facility has a maximum portfolio LTV of 85 and contains customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type of financing arrangement. 

2. Term Warehouse Financing Facilities (CRE loans): Term warehouse financing facilities effectively allow us to borrow against loans that we own. Under these agreements, we transfer loans to a counterparty and agree to purchase the same loans from the counterparty at a price equal to the transfer price plus interest. The counterparty retains the sole discretion over both whether to purchase the loan from us and, subject to certain conditions, the collateral value of such loan for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines (subject to certain conditions) that the value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of (i) the revised collateral or market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of these agreements, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and pay interest to the counterparty. 

3. Securitizations: We seek non-recourse long-term financing from securitizations of our investments in CRE loans. The securitizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan but may involve the entire loan. Securitization generally involves transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes. Securitizations of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate interest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb all losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect to the loan in question. 

4. Mortgage payable: We have entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex. This loan is interest only and has a maximum principal balance, most of which was advanced in the initial funding. The loan agreement contains events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type of financing arrangement. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction. 

5. Construction loans: We have entered into a loan agreement to finance the construction of a student housing complex. This loan is interest only and has a maximum principal balance of 48.0 million. The loan agreement contains events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type of financing arrangement. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction. Additionally, we have entered into a financing agreement to fund energy efficient building improvements at this student housing complex, with a maximum principal balance of 15.5 million. 

We were in compliance with all of our covenants at September 30, 2024 in accordance with the terms provided in agreements with our lenders.

Historically, we have financed the acquisition of our investments through collateralized debt obligations ("CDO") and securitizations that essentially match the maturity and repricing dates of these financing vehicles with the maturities and repricing dates of our investments. In the past, we have derived substantial operating cash from our equity investments in our CDOs and securitizations, which will cease if the CDOs and securitizations fail to meet certain tests. Through September 30, 2024, we did not experience difficulty in maintaining our existing CDO and securitization financing and passed all of the critical tests required by these financings. Our securitizations collectively had balances of 993.6 million and 1.2 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Our leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of borrowings to total equity, may vary as a result of the various funding strategies we use. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our leverage ratio under GAAP was 3.3 and 3.8 times, respectively. The leverage ratio decreased during the period primarily due to the net decrease in borrowings offset by a net increase to total equity.

At September 30, 2024, we have 32.1 million of cumulative net operating losses ("NOL") to carry forward to future years. NOL can generally be carried forward to offset both ordinary taxable income and capital gains in future years. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), along with revisions made by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act reduced the deduction for NOLs generated post 2017 to 80 of taxable income and granted an indefinite carryforward period. Additionally, we have cumulative net capital losses of 121.9 million, which are set to expire at December 31, 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated 14.6 million of taxable income which was offset by our cumulative NOL. This was reported on our tax return that was filed in October 2024. 
 We also have tax assets in our taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS"). These tax assets are analyzed and disclosed quarterly in our financial statements. At September 30, 2024, our TRSs have 60.9 million of NOLs comprising: 39.8 million of pre-TCJA NOLs, some of which are set to expire beginning in 2044 and 21.1 million of NOLs with an indefinite carryforward period. Additionally, our TRSs have cumulative total net capital losses of 1.0 million, which are set to expire at December 31, 2024.

 Distributions 
 We did not pay distributions on our common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we were focused on prudently retaining and managing sufficient excess liquidity. As a result of losses during 2020, we received significant NOL carryforwards and net capital loss carryforwards, as finalized in our 2020 tax return. We intend to retain taxable income by utilizing our NOL carryforwards and expect to generate capital gains to use a portion of our net capital loss carryforwards, thereby growing book value and our investable equity base. As we continue to take steps necessary to stabilize our earnings available for distribution, our Board expects to establish a plan for the prudent resumption of the payment of common share distributions. No assurance, however, can be given as to the amounts or timing of future distributions as such distributions are subject to our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. 
 We intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our preferred stock. 
 U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute at least 90 of its REIT taxable income annually, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its taxable income. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating and debt service requirements on our repurchase agreements and other debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions, or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 General 
 At September 30, 2024, we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or contractually narrow or limited purposes, although we do have interests in unconsolidated entities not established for those purposes. At September 30, 2024, we had not guaranteed obligations of any unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or letter of intent to provide additional funding to any such entities. 
 Unfunded Commitments 
 In the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to borrowers whose loans are in our CRE loan portfolio to provide additional loan funding in the future. Disbursement of funds pursuant to these commitments is subject to the borrower meeting pre-specified criteria. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting requirements and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial investments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Whole loans had 78.4 million and 109.4 million in unfunded loan commitments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Unfunded commitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are unconditionally cancellable. 
 Guarantees and Indemnifications 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may provide guarantees and indemnifications that contingently obligate us to make payments to the guaranteed or indemnified party based on changes in the value of an asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed or indemnified party. As such, we may be obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity s failure to perform or achieve specified performance criteria, or we may have an indirect guarantee of the indebtedness of others. 
 In January 2023, Chapel Drive East, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the FSU Student Venture, entered into a loan agreement (the "Construction Loan Agreement") with Oceanview Life and Annuity Company ("Oceanview") to finance the construction of a student housing complex (the "Construction Loan"). 
 In connection with our investment in the student housing complex, ACRES RF entered into guarantees related to the Construction Loan. Pursuant to the guarantees, Jason Pollack, Frank Dellaglio and ACRES RF (collectively, the "Guarantors"), for the benefit of Oceanview, provided limited "bad boy" guaranties to Oceanview pursuant to the Construction Loan Agreement until the earlier of the payment in full of the indebtedness or the date of a sale of the property pursuant to a foreclosure of the mortgage or deed or other transfer in lieu of foreclosure is accepted by Oceanview. The Guarantors also entered into a Completion Guaranty Agreement for the benefit of Oceanview to guaranty the timely completion of the project in accordance with the Construction Loan Agreement, as well as a Carry Guaranty Agreement, for the benefit of Oceanview to guaranty unconditional payment by Chapel Drive East, LLC of all customary or necessary costs and expenses incurred in connection with the operation, maintenance and management of the property 
 (Back to Index) 71 

(Back to Index) 

 and an Environmental Indemnity Agreement jointly and severally in favor of Oceanview whereby the Guarantors provided environmental representations and warranties, covenants and indemnifications (collectively the "Guaranties"). The Guaranties include certain financial covenants required of ACRES RF, including required net worth and liquidity requirements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by management in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and our financial results. We believe that certain of our policies are critical because they require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. The critical policies summarized below relate to valuation of investment securities, accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities, income taxes, allowance for credit losses and variable interest entities VIEs ). 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 We maintain an allowance for credit loss on our loans held for investment. CRE loans that are held for investment are carried at cost, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable. Effective January 1, 2020, we determine our allowance for credit losses, consistent with GAAP, by measuring CECL on the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis. We utilize a probability of default and loss given default methodology over a reasonable and supportable forecast period after which we revert to the historical mean loss ratio, utilizing a blended approach sourced from our own historical losses and the market losses from an engaged third-party s database, to be applied for the remaining estimable period. The CECL model requires us to make significant judgments, including: (i) the selection of a reasonable and supportable forecast period, (ii) the selection and weighting of appropriate macroeconomic forecast scenarios, (iii) the determination of the risk characteristics in which to pool financial assets, and (iv) the appropriate historical loss data to use in the model. Unfunded commitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are unconditionally cancellable by us. 
 We measure the loan portfolio s credit losses by grouping loans based on similar risk characteristics under CECL, which is typically based on the loan s collateral type. We regularly evaluate the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio to determine whether a different pooling methodology is more accurate. Further, if we determine that foreclosure of a loan s collateral is probable or repayment of the loan is expected through sale or operation of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the current fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the loan. Fair value may be determined based on (i) the present value of estimated cash flows; (ii) the market price, if available; or (iii) the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs. 
 While a loan exhibiting credit quality deterioration may remain on accrual status, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status at such time as (i) management believes that scheduled debt service payments will not be met within the coming 12 months; (ii) the loan becomes 90 days past due; (iii) management determines the borrower is incapable of, or has ceased efforts toward, curing the cause of the credit deterioration; or (iv) the net realizable value of the loan s underlying collateral approximates our carrying value for such loan. While on nonaccrual status, we recognize interest income only when an actual payment is received if a credit analysis supports the borrower s principal repayment capacity. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, previously accrued interest is reversed from interest income. 
 We utilize the contractual life of our loans to estimate the period over which we measure expected credit losses. Estimates for prepayments and extensions are incorporated into the inputs for our CECL model. Modifications to loan terms, such as a modification in connection with a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"), where a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, may result in the extension of the loan s life and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. 
 In order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio applied to the loan portfolio, we utilize historical losses from our full underwriting history, along with the market loss history of a selected population of loans from a third-party s database that are similar to our loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general LTV profiles. We may make adjustments to the historical loss history for qualitative or environmental factors if we believe there is evidence that the estimate for expected credit losses should be increased or decreased. 
 We record write-offs against the allowance for credit losses if we deem that all or a portion of a loan s balance is uncollectible. If we receive cash in excess of some or all of the amounts we previously wrote off, we record a recovery to increase the allowance for credit losses. 
 (Back to Index) 72 

(Back to Index) 

 As part of the evaluation of the loan portfolio, we assess the performance of each loan and assign a risk rating based on the collective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, time since origination, current implied and/or re-underwritten LTV ratios, risk inherent in the loan structure and exit plan. Loans are rated 1 through 5, from least risk to greatest risk, in connection with this review. 
 Investments in Real Estate 
 We acquire investments in real estate through direct equity investments and as a result of our lending activities (i.e. through foreclosure or the receipt of the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure on a property). Acquired investments in real estate assets are recorded initially at fair value in accordance with GAAP. We allocate the purchase price of our acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 We evaluate whether property obtained as a result of our lending activities should be identified as held for sale. If a property is determined to be held for sale, all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will be recorded in property held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Once a property is classified as held for sale, depreciation expense is no longer recorded. 
 Investments in real estate are carried net of accumulated depreciation. We depreciate real property, building and tenant improvements and furniture, fixtures, and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We amortize any acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. We amortize the value allocated to lease right of use assets and related in-place lease liabilities, when determined to be operating leases, using the straight-line method over the remaining lease term. The value allocated to any associated above or below market lease intangible asset or liability is amortized to lease expense over the remaining lease term. 
 Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Costs related to the improvement of the real property are capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives. Costs related to the development and construction of real property are capitalized to construction in progress during the period beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction. 
 We depreciate investments in real estate and amortize intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 

Category 
 
 Term 

Building 
 
 35 to 40 years 

Building improvements 
 
 5 to 39 years 

Site improvements

Revenue Recognition 
 Interest income from our loan portfolio is recognized over the life of each loan using the effective interest method and is recorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into income using the effective yield method. If a loan with a premium or discount is prepaid, we immediately recognize the unamortized portion as a decrease or increase to interest income. In addition, we defer loan origination and extension fees and loan origination costs and recognize them over the life of the related loan with interest income using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective yield method. Income recognition is suspended for loans at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in our opinion, a full recovery of principal and income becomes doubtful. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt, all payments received are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as interest income when received, under the cash method, until an accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. 
 Through our investments in real estate, we earn revenue associated with rental operations and hospitality operations, which are presented in real estate income on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 (Back to Index) 73 

(Back to Index) 

 Rental operating revenue consists of fixed contractual base rent arising from tenant leases at our office properties under operating leases. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of the related leases. For leases that have fixed and measurable rent escalations, the difference between such rental income earned and the cash rent due under the provisions of the lease is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We move to cash basis operating lease income recognition in the period in which collectability of all lease payments is no longer considered probable. At such time, any uncollectible receivable balance will be written off. 
 Hospitality operating revenue consists of amounts derived from hotel operations, including room sales and other hotel revenues. We recognize hospitality operating revenue when guest rooms are occupied, services have been provided or fees have been earned. Revenues are recorded net of any sales, occupancy or other taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties. The following provides additional detail on room revenue and other operating revenue: 
 Room revenue is recognized when our hotel satisfies its performance obligation of providing a hotel room. The hotel reservation defines the terms of the agreement including an agreed-upon rate and length of stay. Payment is typically due and paid in full at the end of the stay with some customers prepaying for their rooms prior to the stay. Payments received from a customer prior to arrival are recorded as an advance deposit and are recognized as revenue at the time of occupancy. 

Other operating revenue is recognized at the time when the goods or services are provided to the customer or when the performance obligation is satisfied. Payment is due at the time that goods or services are rendered or billed. 

Variable Interest Entities 
 We consolidate entities that are VIEs where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of such entities. Once it is determined that we hold a variable interest in a VIE, management performs a qualitative analysis to determine (i) if we have the power to direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE s financial performance; and (ii) if we have the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If our variable interest possesses both of these characteristics, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and would be required to consolidate the VIE. This assessment must be done on an ongoing basis. 
 At September 30, 2024, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of two VIEs that are consolidated. 
 Recent Accounting Standards 
 Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Periods 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, enhance interim disclosure requirements and provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements, unless it is impracticable. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance, however, we do not expect a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and is to be adopted on a prospective basis with the option to apply retrospectively. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance, however, we do not expect a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Inflation 
 Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions are determined by our Board based primarily on our maintaining our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 At September 30, 2024, the primary components of our market risk were credit risk, counterparty risk, financing risk, and interest rate risk, as described below. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we do seek to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience, to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify assuming that risk and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risk we undertake or to which we are exposed. Additionally, refer to Item 1A, "Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information on risks we face. 
 Credit Risks 
 Our loans and investments are subject to credit risk. The performance and value of our loans and investments depend upon the sponsors ability to operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and principal due to us. To monitor this risk, ACRES Capital, LLC s asset management team reviews our investment portfolios and in certain instances is in regular contact with our borrowers, monitoring performance of the collateral and enforcing our rights as necessary. 
 In addition, we are exposed to the risks generally associated with the commercial real estate ("CRE") market, including variances in occupancy rates, capitalization rates, absorption rates, and other macroeconomic factors beyond our control. We seek to manage these risks through our underwriting and asset management processes. 
 In a business environment where benchmark interest rates are increasing significantly, cash flows of the CRE assets underlying our loans may not be sufficient to pay debt service on our loans, which could result in non-performance or default. We partially mitigate this risk by generally requiring our borrowers to purchase interest rate cap agreements with non-affiliated, well-capitalized third parties and by selectively requiring our borrowers to have and maintain debt service reserves. These interest rate caps generally mature prior to the maturity date of the loan and the borrowers are required to pay to extend them. In most cases the sponsors will need to fund additional equity into the properties to cover these costs as the property may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay these costs. At September 30, 2024, 76.2 of the par value of our CRE loan portfolio had interest rate caps in place with a weighted-average maturity of six months. 
 Macroeconomic conditions may persist into the future and impair our borrowers ability to comply with the terms under our loan agreements. We maintain a robust asset management relationship with our borrowers and have utilized these relationships to address rising interest rates, lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other macroeconomic factors on our loans secured by properties experiencing cash flow pressure. While we believe the principal amounts of our loans are generally adequately protected by underlying collateral value, there is a risk that we will not realize the entire principal value of certain investments. In order to mitigate that risk, we have proactively engaged with our borrowers, particularly with those with near-term maturities, in order to maximize recovery. 
 Counterparty Risk 
 The nature of our business requires us to hold our cash and cash equivalents and obtain financing with various financial institutions. This exposes us to the risk that these financial institutions may not fulfill their obligations to us under these various contractual arrangements. We mitigate this exposure by depositing our cash and cash equivalents and entering into financing agreements with high credit-quality institutions. 
 Financing Risk 
 We finance our target assets using our CRE debt securitizations, a senior secured financing facility, warehouse financing facilities and mortgage payables. Over time, as market conditions change, we may use other forms of leverage in addition to these methods of financing. Weakness or volatility in the financial markets, the CRE and mortgage markets or the economy generally could adversely affect one or more of our lenders or potential lenders and could cause one or more of our lenders or potential lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing, or to decrease the amount of our available financing, or to increase the costs of that financing. 
 (Back to Index) 75 

(Back to Index) 

 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our business model is such that rising interest rates will increase our net income, while declining interest rates will decrease net income, subject to the impact of interest rate floors. At September 30, 2024, 99.5 of our CRE loan portfolio by par value earned a floating rate of interest and may be financed with liabilities that both pay interest at floating rates and that are fixed. Floating-rate loans financed with fixed rate liabilities have a negative correlation with declining interest rates to the extent of our financing. The remaining 0.5 of our CRE loan portfolio by par value has a contractual fixed rate of interest. To the extent that interest rate floors on our floating-rate CRE loans are in the money, our net interest will have a negative correlation with rising interest rates to the extent of those interest rate floors. Our floating-rate loan portfolio of 1.6 billion had a weighted-average benchmark floor of 0.85 at September 30, 2024. 
 The following table estimates the hypothetical impact on our net interest income assuming an immediate increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the applicable interest rate benchmark (in thousands, except per share data):

(3) Certain of our floating rate loans are subject to a benchmark floor. 

(4) Decrease in rates assumes the applicable benchmark rate does not fall below 0 . 

Risk Management 
 To the extent consistent with maintaining our status as a REIT, we seek to manage our interest rate risk exposure to protect our variable rate debt against the effects of major interest rate changes. We generally seek to manage our interest rate risk by monitoring and adjusting, if necessary, the reset index and interest rate related to our borrowings.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We may become involved in litigation on various matters due to the nature of our business activities. The resolution of these matters may result in adverse judgments, fines, penalties, injunctions and other relief against us as well as monetary payments or other agreements and obligations. In addition, we may enter into settlements on certain matters in order to avoid the additional costs of engaging in litigation. We are unaware of any contingencies arising from such litigation that would require accrual or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2024. 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 As of the date of this report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), except we may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, USE OF PROCEEDS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 In March 2016, our Board approved a securities repurchase program. In November 2020, our Board authorized and approved the continued use of our existing share repurchase program in order to repurchase up to 20.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock. In November 2023, our Board authorized and approved the repurchase of an additional 10.0 million of outstanding shares of both common and preferred stock. At September 30, 2024, 2.3 million remains available under this repurchase program.
