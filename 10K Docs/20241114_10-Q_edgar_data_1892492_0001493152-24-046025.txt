statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Our expectations are
as of the date this Quarterly Report is filed, and we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this
Quarterly Report is filed to confirm these statements to actual results, unless required by law. 

You
should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties,

As
of September 30, 2024, Eightco had three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Forever 8, Ferguson Containers, Inc. Ferguson Containers and BlockHiro, LLC. Ferguson Containers owns of 8co Holdings Shared Services, LLC. Eightco owns of CW Machines, LLC which is
consolidated under the voting interest entity model. Under the voting interest entity model, control is presumed by the holder of a majority
voting interest unless noncontrolling shareholders have substantive participating rights. Forever 8 owns of Forever 8 UK, Ltd and

During
2021, the Former Parent announced it plans to spin-off (the Separation certain of its businesses. The Former Parent included
Ferguson Containers as well as other subsidiaries of the Former Parent (the Eightco Businesses as part of the spin-off.
In anticipation of the Separation, the Former Parent contributed its assets and legal entities comprising the Eightco Businesses to facilitate
the Separation. As a result of the Separation, the Company has become an independent, publicly traded company comprised of the Eightco
Businesses as of June 30, 2022. 

On
March 29, 2022, Ferguson Containers ownership was assigned by the Former Parent to the Company. This transaction between entities under
common control resulted in a change in reporting entity and required retrospective combination of the entities for all periods presented,
as if the combination had been in effect since the inception of common control. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements
of the Company reflect the accounting of the combined acquired subsidiaries at historical carrying values, except that equity reflects
the equity of Eightco.

years for developed technology, 
years for customer relationships and 
years for trademarks and tradenames. The Company reviews long-lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment annually
and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event the
expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value. If an asset is determined
to be impaired, the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not
available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future
cash flows. In the event that management decides to no longer allocate resources to an asset, an impairment loss equal to the
remaining carrying value of the asset is recorded. The Company recorded impairment charges of 0 and related to long-lived
assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company did not record any impairment charges
related to intangibles assets during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Further, the Company has current
liabilities in excess of current assets. These factors raise substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of one year from the date of this Quarterly Report. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to million at December
31, 2023. The Company expects that its current cash and cash equivalents, approximately million as of the date of this Quarterly Report, will not be sufficient to support its projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this
Quarterly Report. 

The
Company expects to need additional capital in order to increase revenues above current levels. Any additional equity financing, if available,
may not be on favorable terms and would likely be significantly dilutive to the Company s current stockholders, and debt financing,
if available, may involve restrictive covenants. The Company s ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not
achieved on a timely basis, will likely have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In 2023, the Company began reducing headcount to reduce the corporate overhead. The Company has continued to raise capital in 2024 and
will continue to look to further reduce costs in 2024. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
reflected in the accompany financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net income of 3.2 million
and as of September 30, 2024, had stockholders equity of 12.6 million and approximately 2.4 million in cash and cash equivalents
as compared to 5.2 million at December 31, 2023. The Company expects that its current cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to
support its projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months from this date. These factors, among others, raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are
issued. 

40 

The
Company expects to need additional capital in order to maintain revenues at current levels. Any additional equity financing, if available,
may not be on favorable terms and would likely be significantly dilutive to the Company s current stockholders, and debt financing,
if available, may involve restrictive covenants. The Company s ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not
achieved on a timely basis, will likely have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

used for the repayments of convertible notes payable of 4,915,000 offset by proceeds of 2,917,934 from sale of common stock under the
ATM in relation to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

This
discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based on the Company s combined
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America,
or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company bases its estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. 

For
information on the Company s significant accounting policies please refer to Note 2 to the Company s Financial Statements
included in this Quarterly Report.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting
Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, the Company s
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period covered
by this Quarterly Report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that
information that it is required to disclose in reports that the Company files with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the Exchange Act rules and regulations due to the reasons set forth below. 

As
of December 31, 2023, management identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting: the Company
was unable to provide a timely financial reporting package in connection with the year end audit. This was primarily the result of the
Company s limited accounting personnel. This also limits the extent to which the Company can segregate incompatible duties and
has a lack of controls in place to ensure that all material transactions and developments impacting the financial statements are reflected.
There is a risk under the current circumstances that intentional or unintentional errors could occur and not be detected. 

Management
has concluded that the material weakness described above currently exists as of September 30, 2024. The Company plans to engage with
outside consultants to strengthen its capabilities and help the Company in the design and assessment of its internal controls over financial
reporting to further reduce and remediate existing control deficiencies during 2024 and 2025. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected
our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024.
