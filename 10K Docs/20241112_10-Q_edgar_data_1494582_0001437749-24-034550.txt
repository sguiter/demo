Sky Harbour Group Corporation 
 
 In October 2020, our subsidiary BOC Yellowstone LLC, served as sponsor for the underwritten initial public offering of a special purpose acquisition company named Yellowstone Acquisition Company. Yellowstone sold in its public offering units at a price of per unit, each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock and a redeemable warrant to purchase one -half of a share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of per share. Between August and November 2020, we invested, through BOC Yellowstone, approximately million through the purchase of shares of Class B common stock and non-redeemable private placement warrants, each warrant entitling us to purchase one share of Class A common stock at per share. BOC Yellowstone, as the sponsor of Yellowstone and under the terms of the public offering, owned approximately of Yellowstone s issued and outstanding common stock. The purpose of the offering was to pursue a business combination in an industry other than the three industries in which we owned and operated businesses at that time: outdoor advertising, surety insurance, and broadband services businesses. The Units were sold at a price of per unit, generating gross proceeds to Yellowstone of , and traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC under the ticker symbol YSACU. After the securities comprising the units began separate trading, the shares of Class A common stock and warrants were listed on NASDAQ under the symbols YSAC and YSACW, respectively. 
 
 On August 1, 2021, Yellowstone entered into a business combination agreement with Sky Harbour LLC SHG ), a developer of private aviation infrastructure focused on building, leasing, and managing business aviation hangars. On September 14, 2021, our subsidiary BOC YAC Funding LLC completed the previously-announced investment of million in Series B Preferred Units of SHG. In addition to our million investment, we also agreed to provide SHG an additional million through the purchase of additional shares of Yellowstone Class A common stock at a price of per share through a private placement investment PIPE ). 
 
 On January 25, 2022, Yellowstone completed the previously announced proposed business combination with SHG following stockholder approval. As a result, SHG became a consolidated subsidiary of Yellowstone and Yellowstone was renamed Sky Harbour Group Corporation, which we refer to as Sky Harbour. In connection with the business combination, our Series B Preferred Units of SHG converted into shares of Sky Harbour Group Class A common stock at a price of per share.

Of the total gain recognized on deconsolidation, approximately relates to the remeasurement of our retained investment in Sky Harbour via the Sponsor shares, Series B Preferred Units, and PIPE investment, each of which converted into shares of Sky Harbour s Class A common stock on the transaction date, and approximately relates to the deconsolidation of Yellowstone s assets and liabilities as of the transaction date.

Subsequent to the business combination, we account for our equity investment in Sky Harbour under the equity method.

 All the shares of Sky Harbour Class A common stock and Sky Harbour warrants to purchase Class A common stock that we hold have been registered under the Securities Act.

The terms of the Sky Harbour business combination prohibited us from selling any of our securities in Sky Harbour prior to January 25, 2023 and has since expired. The carrying value of our investment in Sky Harbour s Class A common stock as of September 30, 2024 is approximately .

Overview 
 
 We are currently engaged in outdoor billboard advertising, broadband services, surety insurance and related brokerage businesses and an asset management business. In addition, we hold minority investments in commercial real estate management and brokerage services, a bank focused on servicing the automotive loan market, and a developer of private aviation infrastructure focused on building, leasing and managing business aviation hangars. 
 
 Billboards : In June 2015, we commenced our billboard business operations through acquisitions by Link, our wholly-owned subsidiary, of smaller billboard companies located in the Southeastern United States and Wisconsin. During July and August 2018, we acquired the membership interest or assets of three larger billboard companies which increased our overall billboard count to approximately 2,900 billboards. In addition, we have made several billboard acquisitions on a smaller scale since that date. We believe that we are a leading outdoor billboard advertising company in the markets we serve in the Midwest. As of September 30, 2024, we operate approximately 4,000 billboards with approximately 7,600 advertising faces. One of our principal business objectives is to continue to acquire additional billboard assets through acquisitions of existing billboard businesses in the United States when they can be made at what we believe to be attractive prices relative to other opportunities generally available to us. 
 
 Surety Insurance : In September 2015, we established an insurance subsidiary, GIG, designed to own and operate insurance businesses generally handling high volume, lower policy limit commercial lines of property and casualty insurance. In April 2016, our surety insurance business commenced with the acquisition of a surety insurance brokerage business with a national internet-based presence. In December 2016, we completed the acquisition of UCS, a surety insurance company, which at that time was licensed to issue surety bonds in only nine states. UCS now has licenses to operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, over the last several years, we have also acquired additional surety insurance brokerage businesses located in various regions of the United States. We may in the future expand the reach of our insurance activities to other forms of insurance which may have similar characteristics to surety, such as high volume and low average policy premium insurance businesses which historically have similar economics. 
 
 Broadband Services : In April 2019, we established a broadband subsidiary, Fiber is Fast, LLC, which has changed its name to Boston Omaha Broadband, LLC, which we refer to as "BOB." In March 2020, we commenced our broadband services business with the acquisition of substantially all of the business assets of FibAire, a rural broadband internet provider that served over 8,000 customers in communities in southern Arizona with a high-speed fixed wireless internet service and is building an all fiber-to-the-home network in select Arizona markets. In December 2020, we acquired substantially all of the business assets of UBB, a broadband internet provider that provided high-speed internet to over 10,000 customers throughout Utah. In September 2021, we announced the launch of Fiber Fast Homes, LLC, which we refer to as "FFH," which partners with builders, developers, and build for rent communities to build fiber-to-the-home infrastructure and provide fiber internet service to residents. In April 2022, we acquired substantially all of the business assets of InfoWest and Go Fiber, which we refer to on a combined basis now as "InfoWest," fiber and fixed wireless internet service providers with over 20,000 customers throughout Southern and Central Utah, Northern Arizona, and Moapa Valley, Nevada. In addition, over the last few years, we have also acquired additional smaller broadband businesses located in Utah. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 45,600 broadband customers (14,000 fiber subscribers) and 37,200 fiber passings completed. We hope to continue to expand in Arizona, Florida, Nevada, Utah, and other locales. 
 
 Investments : 

Since September 2015, we have made a series of investments in commercial real estate, a commercial real estate management, brokerage and related services business as well as an asset management business. We currently own 30 of Logic. On May 1, 2023, our BOAM subsidiary acquired 100 of the membership interests in 24th Street from the members of 24th Street other than BOAM for cash and BOC Class A common stock valued at 5,016,494 in the aggregate. Prior to the transaction, BOAM indirectly owned 48 of the membership interests of 24th Street. The consideration consisted of 2,759,072 in cash at closing, an additional 1,254,102 in cash subject to holdback, and 45,644 shares of BOC Class A common stock (based on the average closing price of BOC Class A common stock for the 30 business day period ending two days before the closing date). The shares issued in the transaction are unregistered and have no registration rights. The purchase agreement also provides for certain payments based on performance to receive the holdback amount and certain other potential earnout payments. In addition, we have invested, through one of our subsidiaries, an aggregate of 6 million in the 24th Street Funds. These funds are managed by 24th Street and focus on opportunities within secured lending and direct investments in commercial real estate. 

In December 2017, we invested 10 million in common units of DFH, the parent company of Dream Finders Homes, LLC, a national home builder. In addition to its homebuilding operations, DFH's subsidiaries provide mortgage loan origination and title insurance services to homebuyers. On January 25, 2021, Dream Finders Homes, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of DFH, completed its initial public offering and Dream Finders Homes, Inc. became a holding company and sole manager of DFH. Upon completion of the initial public offering, our outstanding common units in DFH were converted into 4,681,099 shares of Class A common stock of Dream Finders Homes, Inc., and one of our subsidiaries purchased an additional 120,000 shares of Class A common stock in the initial public offering. Since DFH's initial public offering through December 31, 2022, we have sold all 4,801,099 shares of DFH Class A common stock for gross proceeds of approximately 81 million. 

In May 2018, through one of our subsidiaries, we invested approximately 19 million through the purchase of common stock of CB T, the privately-held parent company of Crescent Bank. Our investment now represents 15.6 of CB T s outstanding common stock. Crescent Bank is located in New Orleans and generates the majority of its revenues from indirect subprime automobile lending across the United States. 

In October 2020, our subsidiary BOC Yellowstone served as sponsor for the underwritten initial public offering of a special purpose acquisition company named Yellowstone Acquisition Company. Yellowstone sold in its public offering 13,598,898 units at a price of 10.00 per unit, each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock and a redeemable warrant to purchase one-half of a share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per share. Between August and November 2020, we invested, through BOC Yellowstone, approximately 7.8 million through the purchase of 3,399,724 shares of Class B common stock and 7,719,779 non-redeemable private placement warrants, each warrant entitling us to purchase one share of Class A common stock at 11.50 per share. In August 2021, Yellowstone entered into a business combination agreement with Sky Harbour LLC, a developer of private aviation infrastructure focused on building, leasing and managing business aviation hangars. The business combination was completed on January 25, 2022 and Yellowstone changed its name to Sky Harbour Group Corporation. Sky Harbour s Class A common stock trades on the NYSE American under the symbol SKYH and its warrants to purchase Class A common stock trade under the symbol SKYH.WS.

In September 2021, through one of our subsidiaries, we invested 55 million directly into SHG and received Series B preferred units. Upon the successful consummation of the Sky Harbour business combination, this investment converted into 5,500,000 shares of Sky Harbour's Class A common stock based upon an assumed value of 10.00 per share. In December 2021, we agreed to provide Sky Harbour an additional 45 million through the purchase of 4,500,000 shares of Class A common stock upon the closing of the Sky Harbour business combination, which was consummated in January 2022. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we sold 246,389 shares of Sky Harbour Class A common stock for gross proceeds of approximately 2.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, we held 12,440,642 shares of Sky Harbour Class A common stock and 7,719,779 Sky Harbour warrants. 

In 2021, we established the BFR Fund subsidiary within BOAM to operate a proposed build-for-rent business, focusing on developing, building, and managing single family detached and/or townhomes for long term rentals. We invested approximately 15 million of capital to finance the initial acquisitions for these projects and subsequently raised third-party capital to be invested alongside our capital. The BFR Fund acquired land parcels in Nevada with the initial plan to develop, construct, and operate build-for-rent communities. However, challenges in the market, including the increase in interest rates and the inability to achieve what we believe are appropriate risk-adjusted returns, have led us to pursue selling the BFR Fund's entitled land assets to public homebuilders. Consequently, we have started to wind down the BFR Fund earlier than originally targeted by returning the uninvested cash on hand to BFR Fund partners and, as we sell the BFR Fund's entitled land assets, returning that capital to BFR Fund partners as well. 

In July 2023, we invested approximately 3 million in voting preferred stock of MyBundle.TV Inc., a company serving the broadband industry. 

In each of our businesses, we hope to expand our geographic reach and market share and seek to develop a competitive advantage and/or brand name for our services, which we hope will be a differentiating factor for customers. Our insurance market primarily services small contractors, small and medium-sized businesses and individuals required to provide surety bonds (i) in connection with their work for government agencies and others, (ii) in connection with contractual obligations, or (iii) to meet regulatory requirements and other needs. We have expanded the licensing of the UCS business to all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In outdoor advertising, our plan is to continue to grow this business through acquisitions of billboard assets. We expect to expand our broadband services in Arizona, Florida, Nevada, Utah and in other locations. In the future, we expect to expand the range of services we provide in the insurance sector, seek to continue to expand our billboard operations and broadband services and to possibly consider acquisitions of other businesses, as well as investments, in other sectors, although we expect to place primary emphasis on growing our existing business lines over the next several years. Our decision to expand outside of these current business sectors we serve or in which we have made investments will be based on the opportunity to acquire businesses which we believe provide the potential for sustainable earnings at an attractive level relative to capital employed and, with regard to investment, we believe have the potential to provide attractive returns. 
 
 We seek to enter markets where we believe demand for our services will grow in the coming years due to certain barriers to entry and/or to anticipated long-term demand for these services. In the outdoor billboard business, government restrictions often limit the number of additional billboards that may be constructed. At the same time, advances in billboard technology provide the opportunity to improve revenues through the use of digital display technologies and other new technologies. In the surety insurance business, new insurance companies must be licensed by state agencies that impose capital, management and other strict requirements on these insurers. These hurdles are at the individual state level, with statutes often providing wide latitude to regulators to impose judgmental requirements upon new entrants. In addition, new distribution channels in certain areas of surety may provide a new opportunity. In the real estate management services market, we believe the continued growth of commercial real estate in many sections of the United States will provide opportunities for management services for the foreseeable future. We also believe our investment in both CB T and Sky Harbour has provided each company the opportunity to significantly grow its business. We invest our available capital and the surplus capital from UCS in a wide range of securities, including equity securities of large cap public companies, various corporate and government bonds and U.S. treasuries. In broadband services, we believe that our fiber-to-the-home services can compete with traditional cable operators as broadband provides higher rates of transmission and improved speed to consumers and that, once built, other competitors may be less willing to compete in communities which we serve.

How We Generate Our Revenues and Evaluate Our Business 
 
 We currently generate revenues primarily through billboard advertising and related services, from the sale of surety insurance and related brokerage activities, by providing high-speed broadband services, and asset management services. Revenue for outdoor advertising space rental is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and advertising revenue is reported net of agency commissions. Payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenue. In our surety insurance business, premiums written are recognized as revenues based on a pro rata daily calculation over the respective terms of the policies in-force. Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired term of the policies in-force. In connection with our surety agency business, insurance commissions are recognized at a point in time, on a bond-by-bond basis as of the policy effective date and are generally nonrefundable. In our broadband business, revenue is derived principally from internet services and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract in the period the services are rendered. Revenue received or receivable in advance of the delivery of services is included in deferred revenue. 
 
 Segment gross profit is a key metric that we use to evaluate segment operating performance and to determine resource allocation between segments. We define segment gross profit as segment revenues less segment direct cost of services. In our billboard business, direct cost of services includes land leases, utilities, repairs and maintenance of equipment, sales commissions, contract services, and other billboard level expenses. In our broadband business, direct costs of services includes network operations and data costs, software costs, cell site rent and utilities, and other broadband level expenses. In our surety business, direct cost of services includes commissions, premium taxes, fees and assessments, and losses and loss adjustment expenses.

We realized total revenues of 27,700,936 during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of 12.8 over revenues of 24,548,101 during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The key factors impacting revenue across each of our businesses during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 

Net billboard rentals in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 5.6 from the third quarter of fiscal 2023, reflecting an improvement in rental and occupancy rates across a number of our markets. 

Revenue from broadband services in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 7.4 from the third quarter of fiscal 2023, mainly reflecting subscriber growth across a number of our markets. 

Premiums earned from our UCS insurance subsidiary increased 45.6 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in premiums earned was primarily due to increases in production throughout fiscal 2023 and the first nine months of fiscal 2024. We recognize revenues for written premium over the life of the surety bond and, as a result, increased sales activities are not fully reflected in the quarter in which the surety bond is issued. 

Revenue from insurance commissions generated by our surety brokerage operations increased by 37.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, mainly due to increased production through outside insurance carriers. 

Investment and other income at UCS and BOAM increased from 554,238 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 587,238 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we had total costs and expenses of 28,440,958, as compared to total costs and expenses of 26,490,830 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Total costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from 107.9 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 102.7 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The key factors impacting costs and expenses across each of our businesses during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 

Cost of billboard revenues increased as a percentage of billboard revenues from 35.0 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 35.2 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase was mainly driven by higher commissions paid and other billboard cost of revenues, which was partially offset by lower ground rent expense and utilities expense as a percentage of billboard revenues. 

Cost of broadband revenues decreased as a percentage of broadband revenues from 26.2 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 24.9 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was mainly driven by lower commissions paid within other broadband cost of revenues as well as cell site rent and utilities, which was partially offset by higher network operations and data costs as well as software costs as a percentage of broadband revenues. 

Cost of insurance revenues decreased as a percentage of insurance revenues from 39.7 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 39.5 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was mainly driven by lower commissions paid and loss and loss adjustment expense, which was partially offset by higher premium taxes, fees, and assessments as a percentage of insurance revenues. 

Employee costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were 8,311,882, or 30.0 of total revenues, as compared to 8,080,596, or 32.9 of total revenues, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease as a percentage of total revenues was mainly driven by the reduction in headcount within our asset management business and at Boston Omaha's parent company.

Table of Contents 

Professional fees in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were 1,052,542, or 3.8 of total revenues, as compared to 1,249,036, or 5.1 of total revenues, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease was mainly related to lower acquisition related fees within our billboard business and audit and consulting fees within our insurance business. 

General and administrative expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were 4,339,357, or 15.7 of total revenues, as compared to 4,198,682, or 17.1 of total revenues, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease as a percentage of total revenues was mainly driven by higher organic revenue growth within our billboard, broadband and insurance businesses. 

Non-cash expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 included 3,698,488 in depreciation expense, 1,975,174 in amortization expense, and 55,000 in accretion expense mainly related to asset retirement obligations for certain billboard assets. The increase in depreciation expense is mainly driven by continued capital investments within our broadband businesses. 

Net Loss from Operations. Net loss from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 740,022, or 2.7 of total revenues, as compared to a net loss from operations of 1,942,729, or 7.9 of total revenues, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 . The decrease in net loss from operations was primarily due to improved operations within our billboard, broadband and insurance businesses as well as lower expenses within our asset management business, which were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to continued capital investments within our broadband businesses. Our net loss from operations included 5,728,662 from non-cash depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to 5,036,865 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Other Expense. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we had net other expense of 1,065,883. Net other expense included non-cash losses of 9,358,783 from unconsolidated affiliates mainly related to our share of Sky Harbour's loss from operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which we account for under the equity method, and interest expense of 466,744 mainly incurred under Link's term loan and revolver. These items were partially offset by 8,428,017 in other investment income mainly driven by a 7,796,977 unrealized gain on the Sky Harbour warrants held by Boston Omaha and other investment income of 599,084 primarily related to changes in the fair value of the 24th Street Funds mainly driven by the underlying real estate properties, and interest and dividend income of 331,627. During t he third quarter of fiscal 2023, we had net other expense of 1,230,036, which included other investment losses of 1,894,969 mainly related to the Sky Harbour warrants held by Boston Omaha and the impact of the changes in fair value of the 24th Street Funds, interest expense of 287,084 mainly incurred under Link's term loan and a loss of 125,970 mainly related to our equity method position in Sky Harbour. These items were partially offset by interest and dividend income of 1,077,987. 
 
 Generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires us to include the unrealized changes in market prices of investments in public equity securities in our reported earnings. Due to the size of our percentage ownership interest in Sky Harbour's Class A common stock and our right to elect one of the seven members of Sky Harbour's Board of Directors, our investment is recorded under the equity method and we do not include any unrealized gains or losses related to the change in Sky Harbour's stock price in our reported earnings. In the future, if we are deemed to no longer have significant influence, we may no longer be able to record our investment under the equity method and will be required to include any unrealized gains or losses related to the change in Sky Harbour's stock price in our reported earnings. While we intend to hold our current securities for the longer term, we may in the future choose to sell them for a variety of reasons resulting in realized losses or gains. 
 
 Additionally, we have evaluated our investment in Sky Harbour as of September 30, 2024, and determined that there was not an other-than-temporary impairment. Our conclusion was based on several contributing factors, including: (i) our assessment that the underlying business and financial condition of Sky Harbour is favorable, (ii) Sky Harbour's stock price trading above our carrying value for an extended period of time, and (iii) our ability and intent to hold the investment. We will continue to review our investment in Sky Harbour for an other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis or upon the occurrence of certain events. If Sky Harbour's stock price drops below our carrying value of 5.86 per share for a sustained period of time, it will likely result in an impairment of our investment. There may also be a future impairment of our investment if our expectations about Sky Harbour's prospective results of operations and cash flows decline, which could be influenced by a variety of factors including adverse market conditions. 

Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders. W e had a net loss attributable to common stockholders in the amount of 1,595,136 i n th e third quarter of fiscal 2024 , or a loss per share of 0.05, b ased o n 31,432,515 d iluted weighted average shares outstanding. This is compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of 1,642,506 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 , or a loss per share of 0.05, based on 31,370,760 diluted weighted average shares outstanding.

We realized total revenues of 80,341,450 during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, an increase of 12.2 over revenues of 71,580,280 during the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The key factors impacting revenue across each of our businesses during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 

Net billboard rentals in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 5.0 from the first nine months of fiscal 2023, reflecting an improvement in rental and occupancy rates across a number of our markets. 

Revenue from broadband services in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 11.1 from the first nine months of fiscal 2023, mainly reflecting subscriber growth across a number of our markets. 

Premiums earned from our UCS insurance subsidiary increased 37.6 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 when compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase in premiums earned was primarily due to increases in production throughout fiscal 2023 and the first nine months of fiscal 2024. We recognize revenues for written premium over the life of the surety bond and, as a result, increased sales activities are not fully reflected in the quarter in which the surety bond is issued. 

Revenue from insurance commissions generated by our surety brokerage operations increased by 6.9 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 when compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023, mainly due to increased production through outside insurance carriers. 

Investment and other income at UCS and BOAM increased from 1,576,963 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 1,852,354 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, mainly due to the increase in interest rates over the past several quarters for assets held by UCS and the consolidation of 24th Street during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.

During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we had total costs and expenses of 87,536,368, as compared to total costs and expenses of 78,142,705 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Total costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from 109.2 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 109.0 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The key factors impacting costs and expenses across each of our businesses during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 

Cost of billboard revenues decreased as a percentage of billboard revenues from 35.7 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 34.8 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease was mainly driven by lower ground rent expense and other billboard cost of revenues as a percentage of billboard revenues. 

Cost of broadband revenues decreased as a percentage of broadband revenues from 27.5 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 25.3 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease was mainly driven by lower commissions paid within other broadband cost of revenues as well as reduced maintenance costs and cell site rent related to our fixed wireless networks as a percentage of broadband revenues. 

Cost of insurance revenues decreased as a percentage of insurance revenues from 39.2 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 38.8 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease was mainly driven by lower loss and loss adjustment expense as a percentage of insurance revenues, which was partially offset by commissions paid increasing from 22.8 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 23.4 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 

Employee costs in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were 28,764,730, or 35.8 of total revenues, as compared to 24,031,413, or 33.6 of total revenues, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase as a percentage of total revenues was mainly driven by one-time severance and bonus payments to our former Co-CEO as a part of his separation and stock repurchase agreement. Excluding the one-time severance and bonus payments, employee costs would have been 31.6 of total revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2024.

Professional fees in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were 3,909,612, or 4.9 of total revenues, as compared to 3,821,524, or 5.4 of total revenues, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 

General and administrative expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were 12,400,843, or 15.4 of total revenues, as compared to 12,124,128, or 16.9 of total revenues, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decrease as a percentage of total revenues was mainly driven by higher organic revenue growth within our billboard, broadband and insurance businesses as well as lower general and administrative expenses at Boston Omaha's parent company. 

Non-cash expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 included 10,721,927 in depreciation expense, 5,746,002 in amortization expense, and 163,805 in accretion expense mainly related to asset retirement obligations for certain billboard assets. The increase in depreciation expense is mainly driven by continued capital investments within our broadband businesses. 

Net Loss from Operations. Net loss from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 7,194,918, or 9.0 of total revenues, as compared to a net loss from operations of 6,562,425, or 9.2 of total revenues, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 . The increase in net loss from operations was primarily due to one-time costs associated with our former Co-CEO's separation and stock repurchase agreement and an increase in depreciation expense related to continued capital investments within our broadband businesses, which were partially offset by improved operations within our billboard, broadband and insurance businesses. Our net loss from operations included 16,631,734 from non-cash depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, as compared to 14,497,914 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Other (Expense) Income. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we had net other expense of 834,439. Net other expense included non-cash losses of 16,573,011 from unconsolidated affiliates mainly related to our share of Sky Harbour's loss from operations during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, which we account for under the equity method, and interest expense of 1,117,147 mainly incurred under Link's term loan and revolver. These items were partially offset by 15,671,077 in other investment income mainly driven by a 11,811,262 unrealized gain on the Sky Harbour warrants held by Boston Omaha, 1,957,056 in non-cash gains associated with the transfer of Sky Harbour Class A common stock to our former Co-CEO as a part of his separation and stock repurchase agreement, 894,324 in realized gains on the sale of 246,389 shares of Sky Harbour Class A common stock, and other investment income of 627,937 primarily related to changes in the fair value of the BFR Fund mainly driven by the underlying real estate properties, and interest and dividend income of 1,184,642. During t he first nine months of fiscal 2023, we had net other income of 12,864, which included interest and dividend income of 1,920,943 and equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates of 244,476 mainly related to 4,630,610 in non-cash gains recognized in May 2023 due to our purchase of the membership interests in 24th Street held by third parties resulting in a remeasurement of our previously-held interest in 24th Street, which was almost completely offset by our share of Sky Harbour's loss from operations during the first nine months of fiscal 2023, which we account for under the equity method. These items were partially offset by 1,289,754 in other investment losses mainly related to the changes in fair value of the 24th Street Funds and interest expense of 862,801 mainly incurred under Link's term loan. 
 
 Generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires us to include the unrealized changes in market prices of investments in public equity securities in our reported earnings. Due to the size of our percentage ownership interest in Sky Harbour's Class A common stock and our right to elect one of the seven members of Sky Harbour's Board of Directors, our investment is recorded under the equity method and we do not include any unrealized gains or losses related to the change in Sky Harbour's stock price in our reported earnings. In the future, if we are deemed to no longer have significant influence, we may no longer be able to record our investment under the equity method and will be required to include any unrealized gains or losses related to the change in Sky Harbour's stock price in our reported earnings. While we intend to hold our current securities for the longer term, we may in the future choose to sell them for a variety of reasons resulting in realized losses or gains. 
 
 Additionally, we have evaluated our investment in Sky Harbour as of September 30, 2024, and determined that there was not an other-than-temporary impairment. Our conclusion was based on several contributing factors, including: (i) our assessment that the underlying business and financial condition of Sky Harbour is favorable, (ii) Sky Harbour's stock price trading above our carrying value for an extended period of time, and (iii) our ability and intent to hold the investment. We will continue to review our investment in Sky Harbour for an other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis or upon the occurrence of certain events. If Sky Harbour's stock price drops below our carrying value of 5.86 per share for a sustained period of time, it will likely result in an impairment of our investment. There may also be a future impairment of our investment if our expectations about Sky Harbour's prospective results of operations and cash flows decline, which could be influenced by a variety of factors including adverse market conditions. 

Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders. W e had a net loss attributable to common stockholders in the amount of 6,638,436 i n th e first nine months of fiscal 2024 , or a loss per share of 0.21, b ased o n 31,539,809 d iluted weighted average shares outstanding. This is compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of 3,422,048 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 , or a loss per share of 0.11, based on 31,021,126 diluted weighted average shares outstanding.

Comparison of the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 to the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, there was a 5.6 increase in net billboard revenues from the third quarter of fiscal 2023, reflecting an improvement in rental and occupancy rates across a number of our markets. The key factors affecting our billboard operations results during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 

Ground rent expense decreased as a percentage of total segment operating revenues from 18.9 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 18.7 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 

Commissions paid as a percentage of total segment operating revenues increased from 7.8 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 8.1 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 

Employee costs as a percentage of total segment operating revenues increased from 15.9 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 16.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 

General and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total segment operating revenues from 9.2 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 8.8 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease is mainly driven by lower credit card and merchant fees. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased slightly from 12.0 and 9.1 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 11.3 and 8.5 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, respectively. 

Net interest expense was 431,155 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to net interest expense of 219,510 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase is mainly driven by the additional borrowings on the revolving line of credit.

Comparison of the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 to the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, total operating revenues increased by 7.4 when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 mainly reflecting subscriber growth across a number of our markets. The key factors affecting our broadband operations results during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 

Network operations and data costs as a percentage of total segment operating revenues increased from 12.3 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 13.7 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily driven by higher data costs associated with the expansion of our fiber networks as well as increased maintenance costs related to our fixed wireless networks as a percentage of broadband revenues. 

Other costs of revenues as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 8.2 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 5.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily driven by lower commissions paid. 

Employee costs as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 39.5 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 39.3 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 

Professional fees as a percentage of total segment operating revenues stayed flat at 2.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 20.2 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 19.8 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 596,948 and 67,081, respectively, from the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in depreciation expense is mainly driven by continued capital investments across all of our broadband businesses.

Comparison of the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 to the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, total operating revenues increased by 41.4 when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, mainly due to increased earned premium at our UCS insurance subsidiary. The key factors affecting our insurance operations results during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 

Premiums earned from our UCS insurance subsidiary increased 45.6 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in premiums earned was primarily due to increases in production throughout fiscal 2023 and the first nine months of fiscal 2024. We recognize revenues for written premium over the life of the surety bond and, as a result, increased sales activities are not fully reflected in the quarter in which the surety bond is issued. 

Insurance commissions generated by our surety brokerage operations increased by 37.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, mainly due to increased production through outside insurance carriers. 

Investment and other income at UCS increased from 480,698 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 539,682 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, mainly due to the increase in interest rates over the past several quarters. 

Commissions paid as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 23.3 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 22.8 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, mainly driven by a subset of premiums and commissions ceded to reinsurers. 

Losses and loss adjustment expenses as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 14.7 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 14.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Losses and loss adjustment expenses are reserved monthly based on a percentage of earned premium. 

Employee costs as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 37.2 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 35.0 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease is due to organic revenue growth within our insurance businesses. 

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total segment operating revenues increased from 10.5 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 10.9 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 

During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, our segment income from insurance operations of 804,413 was increased by other investment income of 63,481 mainly from unrealized gains on our investments in publicly held securities. As of September 30, 2024, UCS had 2,447,497 in publicly held securities. We expect to continue to invest a portion of our excess capital in accordance with insurance regulatory limitations in both large-cap publicly traded equity securities and bonds. These investments are subject to the risk of loss in value depending upon market conditions and factors outside of our control.

Comparison of the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2024 to the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023. In September 2017, we formed our asset management business. Throughout fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 we had been hiring within our asset management business to ensure adequate staffing for the anticipated demands and needs of the business. In May 2023, we acquired 100 of the membership interests in 24th Street from the members of 24th Street other than BOAM. As previously mentioned, we are winding down BOAM's operations and implemented cost-cutting measures. Therefore, comparisons of our asset management results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 may not be meaningful. The key factors affecting our asset management operations results during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 

Employee costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were almost completely removed as we wind down BOAM's operations and implemented cost-cutting measures. 

Professional fees in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased by 27,513 from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 mainly due to fund related audit fees. 

General and administrative expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased by 14.6 from the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 

Interest and dividend income decreased by 534,308 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 when compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease is mainly related to the distribution of excess cash in the 24th Street Funds and BFR Fund back to limited partners during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 

Other investment income in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily included the changes in the fair value of the 24th Street Funds mainly driven by the underlying real estate properties. 

Noncontrolling interest in subsidiary income in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily included the external limited partners' share of GAAP income within the 24th Street Funds, mainly driven by the change in fair value referenced above.

Comparison of the First Nine months of Fiscal 2024 to the First Nine of Fiscal 2023. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, there was a 5.0 increase in net billboard revenues from the first nine months of fiscal 2023, reflecting an improvement in rental and occupancy rates across a number of our markets. The key factors affecting our billboard operations results during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 

Ground rent expense decreased as a percentage of total segment operating revenues from 18.9 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 18.6 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 

Commissions paid as a percentage of total segment operating revenues increased from 7.9 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 8.0 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 

Employee costs as a percentage of total segment operating revenues increased from 16.7 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 16.9 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 

General and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total segment operating revenues from 9.2 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 8.9 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased slightly from 11.9 and 9.2 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 11.4 and 8.7 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, respectively. 

Net interest expense was 1,016,886 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to net interest expense of 707,498 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase is mainly driven by the additional borrowings on the revolving line of credit.

Comparison of the First Nine Months of Fiscal 2024 to the First Nine Months of Fiscal 2023. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, total operating revenues increased by 11.1 when compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 mainly reflecting subscriber growth across a number of our markets. The key factors affecting our broadband operations results during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 

Network operations and data costs as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 14.7 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 13.6 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 primarily driven by reduced maintenance costs incurred during the period related to our fixed wireless networks. 

Other costs of revenues as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 6.2 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 6.0 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 

Employee costs as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 40.0 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 39.1 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease is due to organic revenue growth within our broadband businesses. 

Professional fees as a percentage of total segment operating revenues increased from 2.3 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 2.6 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 19.9 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 19.1 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease is due to organic revenue growth within our broadband businesses. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 1,834,223 and 195,537, respectively, from the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase in depreciation expense is mainly driven by continued capital investments across all of our broadband businesses.

Comparison of the First Nine Months of Fiscal 2024 to the First Nine Months of Fiscal 2023. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, total operating revenues increased by 32.4 when compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023, mainly due to increased earned premium at our UCS insurance subsidiary. The key factors affecting our insurance operations results during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 

Premiums earned from our UCS insurance subsidiary increased 37.6 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 when compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase in premiums earned was primarily due to increases in production throughout fiscal 2023 and the first nine months of fiscal 2024. We recognize revenues for written premium over the life of the surety bond and, as a result, increased sales activities are not fully reflected in the quarter in which the surety bond is issued. 

Insurance commissions generated by our surety brokerage operations increased by 6.9 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 when compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023, mainly due to increased production through outside insurance carriers. 

Investment and other income at UCS increased from 1,357,930 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 1,634,199 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, mainly due to the increase in interest rates over the past several quarters. 

Commissions paid as a percentage of total segment operating revenues increased from 22.8 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 23.4 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, mainly driven by increased production from non-affiliated insurance brokerage firms. 

Losses and loss adjustment expenses as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 14.4 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 13.2 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Losses and loss adjustment expenses are reserved monthly based on a percentage of earned premium. 

Employee costs as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 38.2 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 35.1 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The decrease is due to organic revenue growth within our insurance businesses. 

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total segment operating revenues decreased from 11.4 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to 11.2 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 

During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, our segment income from insurance operations of 1,940,290 was increased by other investment income of 271,191 mainly from unrealized gains on our investments in publicly held securities. As of September 30, 2024, UCS had 2,447,497 in publicly held securities. We expect to continue to invest a portion of our excess capital in accordance with insurance regulatory limitations in both large-cap publicly traded equity securities and bonds. These investments are subject to the risk of loss in value depending upon market conditions and factors outside of our control.

Comparison of the First Nine Months of Fiscal 2024 to the First Nine Months of Fiscal 2023. In September 2017, we formed our asset management business. Throughout fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 we had been hiring within our asset management business to ensure adequate staffing for the anticipated demands and needs of the business. In May 2023, we acquired 100 of the membership interests in 24th Street from the members of 24th Street other than BOAM. As previously mentioned, we are winding down BOAM's operations and implemented cost-cutting measures. Therefore, comparisons of our asset management results for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 may not be meaningful. The key factors affecting our asset management operations results during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 

Employee costs in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 decreased by 40.2 from the first nine months of fiscal 2023 as we wind down BOAM's operations and implemented cost-cutting measures. 

Professional fees in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased by 40.9 from the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 

General and administrative expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased by 11.8 from the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 

Interest and dividend income decreased by 93,001 in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 when compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decrease is mainly related to the distribution of excess cash in the 24th Street Funds and BFR Fund back to limited partners during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 

Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates of 4,630,610 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was related to non-cash gains recognized in May 2023 due to our purchase of the membership interests in 24th Street held by third parties resulting in a remeasurement of our previously-held interest in 24th Street. 

Other investment income in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 primarily included the changes in the fair value of the 24th Street and BFR Funds mainly driven by the underlying real estate properties. 

Noncontrolling interest in subsidiary income in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 mainly included the external limited partners' share of GAAP income within the BFR Fund and GAAP losses within the 24th Street Funds, mainly driven by the change in fair value referenced above.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 12,117,191 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 12,241,695 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by costs associated with our former Co-CEO's separation and stock repurchase agreement as well as operating costs within our FFH business. These items were partially offset by improved cash flow generation within our billboard, broadband, and insurance businesses. 
 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities. Net cash provided by investing activities was 29,893,384 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared with net cash used in investing activities of 48,959,016 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities is primarily attributable to 53,670,044 in net proceeds from sales of investments mainly from the sale or maturity of U.S. Treasury securities within the 24th Street Funds and BFR Fund, which was partially offset by 23,696,261 in capital expenditures mainly within our broadband businesses. 
 
 Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was 48,879,743 during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 34,115,891 during the first nine months of fiscal 2023. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, net cash used in financing activities mainly consisted of 36,992,659 in distributions to noncontrolling interests from the 24th Street Funds and BFR Fund, 16,761,371 related to the repurchase of Class A and Class B common stock and Class B warrants from our former Co-CEO, 2,826,309 in collateral released by UCS, and 1,380,180 related to the repurchase of Class A common stock through our share repurchase program. These items were partially offset by 10,000,000 in additional borrowings on Link's revolving line of credit.

 Currently, we own billboards in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin, a surety insurance company we acquired in December 2016, surety insurance brokerage firms we acquired in 2016, 2017 and 2021, broadband services providers whose assets we acquired in 2020, 2022 and 2023, an asset management business, minority investments in commercial real estate management and brokerage services, a bank focused on servicing the automotive loan market, and a developer of private aviation infrastructure focused on building, leasing and managing business aviation hangars. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 19.4 million in unrestricted cash and approximately 15.3 million in short-term treasury securities. Our strategy is to continue to acquire other billboard locations, insurance businesses, and broadband service providers as well as acquire other businesses and open new businesses which we believe have the potential to generate positive cash flows when made at what we believe to be attractive prices relative to other opportunities generally available to us. We currently expect to finance any future acquisitions and investments with cash, debt and seller or third-party financing. In the future, we may satisfy all or a portion of the purchase price for an acquisition with our equity securities. In addition, we have made investments in several companies and expect to continue to make investments in the securities of both publicly traded and privately held companies. 
 
 On July 23, 2024, the Board approved and authorized a share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program ), pursuant to which the Company intends to repurchase up to 20 million of its Class A common stock, from time to time, in the open market, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Board also authorized the Company, in its discretion, to establish Rule 10b5-1 trading plans for these share repurchases. The Share Repurchase Program went into effect on or about August 15, 2024 and will terminate on September 30, 2025, unless earlier terminated in the discretion of the Board. The actual timing, number, and value of shares repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program will depend on a number of factors, including constraints specified in applicable SEC regulations, price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, the Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares of its Class A common stock and shall not repurchase more than 25 of the average daily volume of its stock over the previous 20 trading days. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we repurchased 97,262 shares of our Class A common stock for a total cost of 1,380,180. 
 
 There can be no assurance that we will consummate any subsequent acquisitions. Furthermore, our acquisitions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including as to when, whether and to what extent the anticipated benefits and cost savings of a particular acquisition will be realized. Our failure to successfully identify and complete future acquisitions of assets or businesses could reduce future potential earnings, available cash, and slow our anticipated growth. Although we have entered and continue to enter into non-binding letters of intent to acquire businesses on a regular basis, we do not have current agreements, commitments or understandings for any specific material acquisitions which are probable to be consummated at this time. 
 
 To date, we have raised funds through the sale of our common stock in public offerings, sales of our common stock in at the market programs, term loan financing through our Link subsidiary, proceeds from the sale of publicly traded securities held by us, cash flow from operations, and, prior to 2019, through private placements of our common stock. As described below, we may raise additional funds through our shelf registration statement allowing us to raise up to 500 million through the sale of securities to fund future acquisitions and investments.

2022 Shelf Registration Statement 
 
 In April 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-264470) that was declared effective on May 11, 2022, which we refer to as the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement, relating to the registration of Class A common stock, preferred stock, par value 0.001 per share, which we refer to as preferred stock, debt securities and warrants of the Company for up to 500 million. We may, from time to time, in one or more offerings, offer and sell Class A common stock or preferred stock, various series of debt securities, and/or warrants. The shelf registration statement may also be used by one or more selling security holders, to be identified in the future, of our securities. We or any selling security holders may offer these securities from time to time in amounts, at prices and on terms determined at the time of offering. We may sell these securities to or through one or more underwriters, dealers or agents, or directly to purchasers on a delayed or continuous basis. Unless otherwise set forth in an applicable prospectus supplement, we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities that we offer for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, financing our existing businesses and operations, and expanding our businesses and operations through additional hires, strategic alliances and acquisitions. Unless otherwise set forth in a prospectus supplement, we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of securities by any selling stockholders. 
 
 Additionally, in the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement, we registered for resale up to 8,297,093 shares of Class A common stock acquired in 2018 or earlier in private placements in accordance with the terms of a 2018 registration rights agreement. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock by the selling shareholders. Currently, the selling stockholders are the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, as well as 238 Plan Associates LLC, an MIT pension and benefit fund, and a limited partnership holding our Class A common stock for the economic benefit of MIT. No officer or director has any beneficial interest in any shares eligible for resale by the selling shareholders.

At The Market Offering Programs 
 
 Starting in March 2018, we utilized our "at the market" offering that was part of our 2018 Shelf Registration Statement. This 2018 Shelf Registration Statement, which authorized us to sell up to 200 million through the sales of securities to the public, expired in February 2021 and was superseded by the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement. We sold a total of 2,630,787 shares of Class A common stock resulting in gross proceeds of 60.1 million under the 2018 Shelf Registration Statement. 
 
 On September 29, 2021, we entered into an "at the market" equity offering program pursuant to a Sales Agreement (the "2021 Sales Agreement") by and between us and WFS. Pursuant to the terms of the 2021 Sales Agreement, we could sell, from time to time, shares of our Class A common stock, with an aggregate sales price of up to 100 million through WFS, in transactions that are deemed to be "at the market" offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). The 2021 Shelf Registration Statement expired on March 28, 2022 upon the filing of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K as we no longer qualified as a well-known seasoned issuer. We sold a total of 122,246 shares of our Class A common stock resulting in gross proceeds of approximately 4.2 million under the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement. 
 
 On December 8, 2022, we entered into an "at the market" equity offering program (the ATM Program pursuant to a Sales Agreement (the 2022 Sales Agreement with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC WFS ). This ATM Program is consistent with our historical practice of having available to management the option to issue stock from time to time in order to continue to fund the growth of its fiber-to-the-home broadband business, acquire additional billboards, and make other such investments in assets as needed to seek to grow intrinsic value per share. Our general preference is always to have options available to it from a capital allocation perspective which includes, but is not limited to, having a regularly filed ATM program. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Sales Agreement, we may sell, from time to time, shares of our Class A common stock, par value 0.001 per share (the Class A common stock ), with an aggregate sales price of up to 100 million through WFS, in transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Since the signing of the 2022 Sales Agreement, we sold 7,887 shares of Class A common stock in December 2022 for gross proceeds of approximately 205 thousand and 1,532,065 shares of our Class A common stock during fiscal 2023 for gross sale proceeds of approximately 37.5 million. We did not sell any shares of our Class A common stock during the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Upon delivery of a placement notice (a Placement Notice and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the 2022 Sales Agreement, WFS will use reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, applicable laws and the rules of the NYSE to sell the shares available under the ATM Program from time to time based upon our instructions for the sales, including price, time or size limits specified, and otherwise in accordance with, the terms of such Placement Notice. Pursuant to the 2022 Sales Agreement, WFS may sell shares of our Class A common stock under the ATM Program by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, including without limitation sales made through the NYSE or on any other existing trading market for the Class A common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, WFS may not purchase shares under the ATM Program for its own account as principal unless expressly authorized to do so by us. 
 
 We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering, after deducting WFS commissions and our offering expenses, for general corporate purposes, which may include financing our existing businesses and operations, and expanding our businesses and operations through additional acquisitions and minority investments, and additional hires. Such expansion may include future billboard acquisitions, broadband acquisitions, acquisitions of surety insurance companies and other growth of our insurance activities, additional investments in real estate management, homebuilding and other real estate service businesses, additional investments in subprime automobile lending, and acquisitions of other businesses. We have not determined the amount of net proceeds to be used for any specific purpose, and we will retain broad discretion over the allocation of net proceeds. While we have no current agreements, commitments or understandings for any specific acquisitions at this time, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes. 
 
 For sales of shares of Class A common stock under the ATM Program through WFS, we will pay WFS a commission at a mutually agreed rate of 3 of the gross sales price per share of Class A common stock sold under the ATM Program. We have no obligation to sell any shares under the 2022 Sales Agreement and may at any time suspend the ATM Program under the 2022 Sales Agreement. The 2022 Sales Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties and indemnification and contribution provisions under which we and WFS have agreed to indemnify each other against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. The ATM Program pursuant to the 2022 Sales Agreement will automatically terminate upon the issuance and sale of all of the shares available for sale under the ATM Program through WFS. In addition, we may terminate the 2022 Sales Agreement with WFS without penalty upon 10 days notice. 
 
 The foregoing description of the 2022 Sales Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 8, 2022 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Link Credit Agreement 
 
 On August 12, 2019, Link entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with First National Bank of Omaha (the Lender under which Link could borrow up to 40 million (the Credit Facility ). The Credit Agreement provided for an initial term loan Term Loan 1 ), an incremental term loan Term Loan 2 and a revolving line of credit. Link initially borrowed approximately 18 million under Term Loan 1 and 5.5 million under Term Loan 2. On December 6, 2021, Link entered into a Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement, which modified the Credit Agreement by increasing the borrowing limit to 30 million and combining the outstanding balances under Term Loan 1 and Term Loan 2 as well as any incremental borrowings into a term loan Term Loan ). The Term Loan is secured by all assets of Link and its operating subsidiaries, including a pledge of equity interests of each of Link s subsidiaries. In addition, each of Link s subsidiaries has joined as a guarantor to the obligations under the Credit Agreement. The loan is not guaranteed by Boston Omaha or any of our non-billboard businesses. 
 
 Principal amounts under the Term Loan were payable in monthly installments according to a 15-year amortization schedule with principal payments commencing on January 1, 2022. Starting July 1, 2023, principal amounts under the Term Loan are payable in monthly installments according to a 25-year amortization schedule. The Term Loan is payable in full on December 6, 2028.

Otherwise, there is a prepayment penalty ranging between 3.0 and 0.5 . After three years, there is no prepayment penalty. The Term Loan has a fixed interest rate of 4.00 per annum. 
 
 On May 30, 2024, Link entered into a Ninth Amendment to Credit Agreement, which modified the Credit Agreement by increasing the maximum availability under the revolving line of credit from 10,000,000 to 15,000,000. Interest payments are based on the U.S. Prime Rate minus an applicable margin ranging between 0.65 and 1.15 dependent on Link s consolidated leverage ratio. The new revolving line of credit is due and payable on August 12, 2026. Long-term debt included within our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 consists of Link s Term Loan borrowings of 26,731,376, of which 842,893 is classified as current, and 9,600,000 related to the revolving line of credit as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Under the Term Loan, Link is required to comply with the following financial covenants: A consolidated leverage ratio for any test period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter of Link (a) beginning with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024 of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00, (b) beginning with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2026 of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and (c) beginning with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2027 and thereafter of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00, and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.15 to 1.00 measured quarterly, based on rolling four quarters. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Credit Agreement includes representations and warranties, reporting covenants, affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type. Upon the occurrence of an event of default the Lender may accelerate the loan. Upon the occurrence of certain insolvency and bankruptcy events of default the loan will automatically accelerate.

Boston Omaha Broadband Credit Agreement 
 
 On September 17, 2024, three operating subsidiaries of Boston Omaha Broadband, LLC ("BOB") entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with First National Bank of Omaha (the Lender under which certain subsidiaries of BOB can borrow up to 20,000,000 in the aggregate in term loans (the Credit Facility ). The three operating subsidiaries which are the borrowers under the Credit Agreement are FIF AireBeam LLC, FIF St. George, LLC, and FIF Utah LLC (collectively, the Borrowers ).

Investments in Yellowstone Acquisition Company and Sky Harbour 
 
 In 2020, we acted as the sponsor for the initial public offering of Yellowstone and purchased 3,399,724 shares of Yellowstone Class B common stock and 7,719,799 private placement warrants at a combined cost of approximately 7.8 million. On August 1, 2021, we entered into an equity purchase agreement with Sky Harbour LLC by which Sky Harbour LLC unitholders would acquire a majority interest in the combined businesses following the completion of a business combination. As part of the equity purchase agreement, and immediately prior to the completion by Sky Harbour LLC of a private activity bond financing raising 160 million in proceeds in September 2021, we purchased Class B Preferred Units in Sky Harbour LLC for a purchase price of 55 million, which Class B Preferred Units converted to 5,500,000 shares of Sky Harbour Class A common stock upon the closing of the Sky Harbour business combination on January 25, 2022. Also, upon the closing of the business combination, we purchased an additional 4,500,000 shares of Sky Harbour Class A common stock for a purchase price of 45 million. 

Upon the closing of the Sky Harbour business combination, our Class B common stock converted to Class A common stock of Sky Harbour and our private placement warrants are now exercisable to purchase 7,719,779 shares of Class A common stock of Sky Harbour. 

Each Sky Harbour warrant is exercisable for one share of Class A common stock at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, with each Sky Harbour Warrant being exercisable through January 25, 2027. Unlike Sky Harbour s publicly traded warrants, these warrants are not redeemable by Sky Harbour as long as we or permitted transferees hold these warrants. The Sky Harbour warrants are also exercisable on a cashless basis. 

Our Sky Harbour Class A common stock, the Sky Harbour warrants, and the shares underlying the warrants were subject to a lockup which expired on January 24, 2023. 

Subsequent to the closing of the Sky Harbour business combination, we distributed 75,000 shares of Sky Harbour Class A common stock to the outside directors of Yellowstone and 206,250 shares of Sky Harbour Class A common stock to an investor in the Yellowstone IPO. As of September 30, 2024, we hold 12,440,642 shares of Sky Harbour Class A common stock and 7,719,779 Sky Harbour warrants. 

All the shares of Sky Harbour Class A common stock and Sky Harbour warrants to purchase Class A common stock that we hold have been registered under the Securities Act. However, our ability to resell any significant portion of these shares is limited by both the large number of shares and warrants we hold relative to the average trading volume of these securities which may prevent us from selling shares as we retain one seat on Sky Harbour s Board of Directors. The terms of the Sky Harbour business combination prohibited us from selling any of our securities in Sky Harbour prior to January 25, 2023 and has since expired.

We believe that our existing cash and short-term investments, funds available through the Credit Agreement Link entered into on August 12, 2019, as amended, funds available through the Credit Agreement Boston Omaha Broadband entered into on September 17, 2024, any funds that we may receive from cash flows from operations, and any funds that we may receive through the sale of real estate assets in the 24th Street and BFR Funds will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for the next 12 months. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 19.4 million in unrestricted cash and approximately 15.3 million in short-term treasury securities. 
 
 If future additional significant acquisition opportunities and expansion opportunities within our billboard and broadband services businesses become available in excess of our currently available cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and marketable equity securities, we may need to seek additional capital through long term debt borrowings, the sale of our securities, and/or other financing options and we may not be able to obtain such debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all. In the future, we may use a number of different sources to finance our acquisitions and operations, including current cash on hand, potential future cash flows from operations, seller financing, debt financings including but not limited to long-term debt and line of credit facilities, including additional credit facilities which may or may not be secured by our assets or those of our operating subsidiaries, additional common or preferred equity issuances or any combination of these sources, to the extent available to us, or other sources that may become available from time to time, which could include asset sales and issuance of debt securities. In addition to current credit facilities at Link and Boston Omaha Broadband, any future debt that we incur may be recourse or non-recourse and may be secured or unsecured. Existing credit facilities at Link and Boston Omaha Broadband imposes restrictions that could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our billboard, insurance, asset management, and broadband businesses. Specifically, these restrictions place limits on Link, Boston Omaha Broadband, and their subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make additional acquisitions and investments, pay dividends, repurchase stock, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge, consolidate, transfer or sell assets. Both credit facilities require Link and Boston Omaha Broadband to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio and other financial covenants. Link s ability as well as Boston Omaha Broadband's ability to comply with these loan covenants may be affected by factors beyond their control and a breach of any loan covenants would likely result in an event of default under either Credit Agreement, which would permit the Lender to declare all amounts incurred thereunder to be immediately due and payable and to terminate their commitment to make future extensions of credit. We also may take advantage of joint venture or other partnering opportunities as such opportunities arise in order to acquire properties that would otherwise be unavailable to us. Any future credit facilities which we or any of our subsidiaries may enter into would likely impose similar restrictions and risks. 
 
 We may use the proceeds of any future borrowings to acquire assets or for general corporate purposes. In determining when to use leverage, we will assess the appropriateness of new equity or debt capital based on market conditions, including assumptions regarding future cash flow, the creditworthiness of customers, and future rental and subscriber rates. 
 
 We conduct and plan to continue to conduct our activities in such a manner as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act"). Therefore, no more than 40 of our total assets can be invested in investment securities, as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, we do not invest or intend to invest in securities as our primary business. Although we do not currently hold investments in an amount which would cause us to register under the Investment Company Act, we run the risk of inadvertently being deemed to be an investment company that is required to register under the Investment Company Act because a significant portion of our assets consists of investments in companies in which we own less than a majority interest. The risk varies depending on events beyond our control, such as significant appreciation or depreciation in the market value of certain of our publicly traded holdings, adverse developments with respect to our ownership of certain of our subsidiaries, and transactions involving the sale of certain assets. If we are deemed to be an inadvertent investment company, we may seek to rely on a safe-harbor under the Investment Company Act that would provide us a one-year grace period to take steps to avoid being deemed to be an investment company. In order to ensure we avoid being deemed an investment company, we have taken, and may need to continue to take, steps to reduce the percentage of our assets that constitute investment assets under the Investment Company Act. These steps have included, among others, selling marketable securities that we might otherwise hold for the long-term and deploying our cash in non-investment assets. We have recently sold marketable securities, including at times at a loss, and we may be forced to sell our investment assets at unattractive prices or to sell assets that we otherwise believe benefit our business in the future to remain below the requisite threshold. We may also seek to acquire additional non-investment assets to maintain compliance with the Investment Company Act, and we may need to incur debt, issue additional equity or enter into other financing arrangements that are not otherwise attractive to our business. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, we can make no assurance that we would successfully be able to take the necessary steps to avoid being deemed to be an investment company in accordance with the safe-harbor. If we were unsuccessful, then we would have to register as an investment company, and we would be unable to operate our business in its current form. We would be subject to extensive, restrictive, and potentially adverse statutory provisions and regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, indebtedness, dividends, and transactions with affiliates. If we were deemed to be an investment company and did not register as an investment company when required to do so, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, and/or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period in which we were deemed to be an unregistered investment company. 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. Our Board of Directors has not adopted a policy limiting the total amount of debt that we may incur. Our Board of Directors will consider a number of factors in evaluating the amount of debt that we may incur. If we adopt a debt policy, our Board of Directors may from time to time modify such policy in light of then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general conditions in the markets for debt and equity securities, fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock if then trading on any exchange, growth and acquisition opportunities, and other factors. Our decision to use leverage in the future to finance our assets will be at our discretion and will not be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and we are not restricted by our governing documents or otherwise in the amount of leverage that we may use.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Except for our normal operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, transactions, or special purpose entities. 
 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we held no significant derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates, foreign currency rates, commodity prices, or other market price risks. Our operations are currently conducted entirely within the U.S.; therefore, we had no significant exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
 Critical Accounting 
 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Information with respect to our critical accounting policies that we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management is contained in Item 7 , Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements each in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk .

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officers, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officers each concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officers, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 Due to the nature of our business, we are, from time to time and in the ordinary course of business, involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities, including, without limitation, workers compensation claims and employment-related disputes. In the opinion of our management, none of the pending litigation, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Not applicable as we are a "smaller reporting company." For a list of risk factors, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 On September 20, 2024, the Company issued to each of its six directors other than Mr. Peterson 2,000 shares of restricted Class A common stock, .001 par value per share ("Class A common stock") pursuant to the Corporation's 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, each such grant valued at 29,840 as of the date of issuance, all of which shares vest as follows: (i) 500 shares vest immediately upon grant, (ii) 500 shares vest on October 1, 2024, (iii) 500 shares vest on January 1, 2025 and (iv) 500 shares vest on April 1, 2025. The shares will automatically vest in full on a sale of the Company, provided that the recipient remains as a director of the Company on such applicable vesting date, subject to certain exemptions. The shares were issued for services rendered to the Company under an exemption available pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. No cash consideration was paid for the shares. 
 
 On July 23, 2024, the Board approved and authorized a share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program ), pursuant to which the Company intends to repurchase up to 20 million of its Class A common stock, from time to time, in the open market, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Board also authorized the Company, in its discretion, to establish Rule 10b5-1 trading plans for these share repurchases. The Share Repurchase Program went into effect on or about August 15, 2024 and will terminate on September 30, 2025, unless earlier terminated in the discretion of the Board. The actual timing, number, and value of shares repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program will depend on a number of factors, including constraints specified in applicable SEC regulations, price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, the Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares of its Class A common stock and shall not repurchase more than 25 of the average daily volume of its stock over the previous 20 trading days. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 97,262 shares of our Class A common stock for a total cost of 1,380,180.
