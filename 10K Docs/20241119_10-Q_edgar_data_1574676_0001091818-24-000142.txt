 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

. In addition, the Company assumed of scheduled liabilities. 

The Company accounted for its acquisition of the
operating assets of Fleaux Solutions, LLC using the acquisition method of accounting. Fleaux Solutions cash on hand, inventories, accounts
receivable, and fixed assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded based upon their estimated fair values as of the closing date
of the Acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. (See Note 4) 

A condensed version of our 2019 Statement of Work
is as follows: 

1. 
 Explore investments both private and public 
 
 2. 
 Develop new technologies for product development, engineering, and manufacturers 
 
 3. 
 Formulate applications for new products recently developed 
 
 4. 
 Commercialize new technology and products 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The Financial Statements and related disclosures
have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). The Financial
Statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP of the United States (See Note 2 regarding the assumption that the Company is a going concern ). Certain prior period amounts
have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at March 31, 2019, and for all periods presented
herein, have been made. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
have been omitted. It is suggested that these unaudited interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and notes thereto included in the Company s December 31, 2018 audited financial statements included in its Form 10-K filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The results of operations for the period ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of
the operating results for the full year. 

The basis of presentation is not consistent between
the successor and predecessor entities and the financial statements are not presented on a comparable basis. As a result, the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and comprehensive income (loss) are presented for two different reporting entities: 

The term Successor relates to the
combined entities financial periods and balance sheets succeeding the Acquisition; the term Predecessor relates to the financial
of Fleaux Solutions, LLC periods preceding the Acquisition (prior to January 29, 2018). 

Unless otherwise indicated, the Company 
as used throughout the remainder of the notes, refers to both the Successor and Predecessor. 

Correction of Previously Reported Interim
Information 

During the audit of the Company s consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company identified errors related to the Predecessor s inventory
accounting, accounts receivable, derivatives depreciation of property and equipment, accounting for capital and operating leases and unrecorded
liabilities. 

This resulted in adjustments to the previously
reported amounts in the unaudited financial statements of the Company for the period from January 29, 2018 through March 31, 2018 (Successor).
In accordance with the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 99 and 108 (SAB 99 and SAB 108), the Company evaluated these errors
and, based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors, determined that the errors were immaterial to the prior reporting periods
affected. Therefore, as permitted by SAB 108, the Company corrected, in the current filing, previously reported unaudited results of the
Company for the period from January 29, 2018 through March 31, 2018 (Successor) 

The table below summarizes the impact on the affected

Contract Costs 

Costs incurred to obtain a customer contract are
not material to the Company. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient to not capitalize contract costs to obtain contracts
with a duration of one year or less, which are expensed and included within cost of goods and services. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Estimates may be used to determine the amount
consideration in contracts, the standalone selling price among separate performance obligations and the measure of progress for contracts
where revenue is recognized over time. The Company reviews and updates these estimates regularly. 

Disaggregation of Revenue 

The following table presents our revenues disaggregated
by revenue source: 

Point Repairs 

- 
 
 Manhole Rehabilitation 

Service Lateral Reconnect 

Cosmic Service Lateral Lining 

Total Revenue 

Pre and Post CCTV consists of cleaning wastewater
lines. Point Repairs consists of an excavator used to find a marked deviated in existing wastewater pipe and repairs and then made to
the line. Manhole Rehabilitation consists of lining the manhole interiors, internal sealing of the joint area, and reconstructing manhole
benches and channels. Service Lateral Reconnect consists of an excavator used to dig where a service needs reconnecting to the main pipe
and the repairs are then made to that line. 

Concentrations 

For the three months ended March 31, 2019 (Successor);
one customer accounted for or of our total revenue, one customer accounted for or of our total revenue, and
one customer accounted for or of our total revenue. 

For the period from January 29, 2018 through March
31, 2018 (Successor); or of our total revenue came from one customer. 

For the period from January 1, 2018 through January
29, 2018 (Predecessor); or of our total revenue came from one customer and or came from one other customer. 

and , respectively. 

As of March 31, 2019 (Successor), or
 was from a single customer, or was from another single customer, and or was from another single customer.
As of December 31, 2018 (Successor), or was from a single customer, and or was from another single customer. 

The first step involves comparing the fair value of a company's reporting
units to their carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be greater than its carrying amount, there is
no impairment. If the reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to be greater than the fair value, the second step must be completed
to measure the amount of impairment, if any. The second step involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the
fair value of all tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit
as determined in step one. The implied fair value of the goodwill in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied
fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of the goodwill, an impairment loss equivalent to the difference is recorded.
The Company performed a qualitative assessment and determined no impairment of goodwill was necessary during 2018. 

The Company recognizes an acquired intangible asset apart from goodwill
whenever the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired
entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability.
Such intangibles are amortized over their useful lives. Impairment losses are recognized is the carrying amount of an intangible asset
subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. 

for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The Company expensed advertising costs of for the period from
January 29, 2018 to March 31, 2018 (Successor), for the period from January 1, 2018 to January 28, 2018 (Predecessor), respectively. 

deferred tax assets were recognized
at March 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018 (Successor). 

The Predecessor was organized as a limited liability company and is
taxed as a partnership for U.S. income tax purposes. As such the Predecessor is not subject to U.S. income taxes. 

The Company does not believe that any other recently
issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying
financial statements. 

. In addition, the Company assumed of scheduled liabilities. 

The Company accounted for its acquisition of the
operating assets of Fleaux Solutions, LLC using the acquisition method of accounting. Fleaux Solutions cash on hand, inventories, accounts
receivable, and fixed assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded based upon their estimated fair values as of the closing date
of the Acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. 

The following table summarizes the estimated fair
values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired as of the date of acquisition: 

Accounts receivable 

Property and equipment 

Goodwill 

Total Assets Acquired 

Assumption of scheduled liabilities 

Net Assets Acquired 

Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over
the fair value of the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards,
goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain indicators are present.
The Company performed a qualitative assessment and determined there was no impairment of goodwill.

business. On June 1, 2019, the Company agreed to sell the business back to the former owners for 70,000 cash in exchange for all equity
interest of Fleaux Solutions, LLC. 

On August 24, 2023, Darrell Peterson and New Green
Holdings, Inc. a Florida C-Corporation New Green entered into an agreement whereby New Green paid 35,000 to Mr. Peterson
to acquire 16,300,000 shares of Series A, 12,700,000 shares of Series B and 1 share of Series C Preferred stock held by Mr. Peterson,
resulting in New Green being the controlled shareholder of the Company. 

Following the New Green transaction, the Company
intends to pursue the business of hemp cultivation and sales, focusing on developing hemp products infused with various items.

Results of Activities 

To provide a meaningful presentation and comparison
of our results of operations, our discussion combines the period of January 1, 2018 through January 28, 2018 (Predecessor) with the period
of January 29, 2018 through March 31, 2018 (Successor). In the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, a black line
separates the Predecessor and Successor financial statements to highlight the lack of comparability between these two periods.

For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and
2018 

Results of Operations 

Revenues 

Our revenues were 1,007,082 for the period ended
March 31, 2019 compared to 1,120,542 in 2018. The 10 decrease in revenue recorded during 2019 was attributable to a decrease in manhole
rehabilitation services and CCTV. However, there was a significant growth in Cosmic service lateral lining contracts during 2019. 

Cost of Revenues 

Our cost of revenue was 264,433 for the three
months ended March 31, 2019, compared to 252,021 in 2018. The increase in the cost of revenue is primarily due to the increased costs
of services related to the additional contracts as described above. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses for the three months ended
March 31, 2019, and 2018, were 761,747 and 549,303, respectively. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to increase
payroll and other general and administrative expenses from the acquisition of the Fleaux Solutions business during 2018 and increased
professional fees. 

Operating Income 

Loss from operations for the three months ended
March 31, 2019 was 19,098 compared to an operating income of 319,218 in 2018. The decrease in 2019 was due to the decrease in revenue
growth and increased operating expenses discussed above. 

Other income/expense 

Total other expense for the three months ended
March 31, 2019 was 233,647 compared to total other income of 8,966 in 2018. Other Expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019,
consisted of a 77,272 loss on derivative instruments, interest expense of 177,285, unrealized gain on trading securities of 33,295
and realized losses on investments of 10,994. Other Expense for 2018 consisted of interest expense of 76,803, unrealized loss on trading
securities of 9,912 and realized losses on investments of 7,590. These were offset by a 102,604 gain on derivative instruments and
miscellaneous income of 667 primarily related to royalty income from battery sales to a related party. 

Net Income/Loss 

Net loss for the period ended March 31, 2019 was
 252,745 compared to net income of 328,184 for 2018. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity refers to our ability
to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our funding needs. We believe we have adequate capital resources and liquidity from our operations
to maintain current operations during 2019 but continue to be dependent on sales of common stock and bank financing to fund operations
until we achieve a positive cash flow. 

We do not currently have material commitments
for capital expenditures and do not anticipate entering into any such commitments during the next twelve months. 

At March 31, 2019, we had current assets of 1,264,336
comprised of cash and cash equivalents of 20,644 and marketable securities of 102,000, accounts receivable of 983,941 and inventory
of 157,751. Our current liabilities were 2,039,656, comprised of 485,379 in accounts payable and accrued expenses, line of credit balances
of 640,418, convertible notes payable of 11,409, right of use liabilities totaling 250,977, derivative liabilities of 90,727, and
other short term debt totaling 208,602 and 352,144 in amounts due to related parties, resulting in a working capital deficit of 775,320). 

4 

At December 31, 2018, we had current assets of 1,270,039 comprised
of cash and cash equivalents of 181,645 and marketable securities of 108,150, accounts receivable of 815,266 and inventory of 164,978.
Our current liabilities were 2,018,843, comprised of 492,805 in accounts payable and accrued expenses, line of credit balances of 639,841,
convertible notes payable of 182,507, other short-term debt totaling 376,546 and 327,144 in amounts due to related parties, resulting
in working capital deficit of 748,804). 

To provide a meaningful presentation and comparison
of our results of operations, our discussion combines the period of January 1, 2018, through January 28, 2018 (Predecessor) with the period
of January 29, 2018 through December 31, 2018 (Successor). In the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, a black line
separates the Predecessor and Successor financial statements to highlight the lack of comparability between these two periods. 

Deficit accumulated since inception is 4,092,267.
Our ability to meet our financial liabilities and commitments is primarily dependent upon the continued financial support of our management
and stockholders, the continued issuance of equity to new stockholders, and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. 

Our ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and attain profitable operations. Since its inception, we have been funded by sales
of company stock, and funds contributed by related parties through capital investment and borrowing funds. For these reasons, our auditors
stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going
concern without further financing. 

Future Financings 

We will continue to rely on equity sales of our
common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing
stockholders. You have no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing
to fund planned acquisitions and Development activities. 

Summary of Cash Flows 

Cashflow from operating activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was 166,308

arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
