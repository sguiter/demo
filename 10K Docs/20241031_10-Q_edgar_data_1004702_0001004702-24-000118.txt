 Summary 
 OceanFirst Financial Corp. is the holding company for OceanFirst Bank N.A. (the Bank ), a regional bank serving business and retail customers throughout New Jersey and the major metropolitan areas between Massachusetts and Virginia. The term Company refers to OceanFirst Financial Corp., the Bank and all their subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The Company s results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest expense on its interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The Company also generates non-interest income such as income from bankcard services, trust and asset management products and services, deposit account services, sales of loans and investments, bank owned life insurance and commercial loan swap income. The Company s operating expenses primarily consist of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, marketing, federal deposit insurance and regulatory assessments, data processing, check card processing, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses. The Company s results of operations are significantly affected by competition, general economic conditions, including levels of unemployment and real estate values, as well as changes in market interest rates, inflation, government policies and actions of regulatory agencies. 
 Key developments relating to the Company s financial results and corporate activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 
 Net Interest Income Stabilization : Net interest income of 82.2 million for the quarter as compared to 82.3 million in the prior linked quarter. 
 Deposits : Total deposits increased by 122.2 million to 10.1 billion from 10.0 billion, and the loan-to-deposit ratio was 99 at September 30, 2024. 
 Strategic Investments: The results include 3.3 million of expenses, of which 1.7 million related to merger and acquisition costs for the talent acquisition of Garden State Home Loans, Inc. and acquisition of Spring Garden Capital Group, LLC. 1 These are expected to improve future operating performance by expanding fee revenue and specialty finance offerings. 
 Asset Quality: Asset quality metrics remain strong as non-performing loans and loans 30 to 89 days past due as a percentage of total loans receivable were 0.28 and 0.15 , respectively. Non-performing loans decreased by 5.3 million, to 28.1 million, and the Company recorded net loan recoveries of 88,000 for the quarter. 
 The current quarter was impacted by a continued mix-shift and repricing of funding costs. Further, the results were impacted by the following non-recurring events: 1.7 million of merger related expenses, a 1.4 million gain on sale of a portion of the Company s trust business, a 855,000 gain on sale of assets held for sale, and the resolution, via sale of collateral, of a single commercial real estate relationship of 7.2 million that was moved to non-accrual and partially charged-off in prior periods. 
 Net income available to common stockholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 24.1 million and 75.1 million, respectively, or 0.42 and 1.29 per diluted share, as compared to 19.7 million and 73.3 million, or 0.33 and 1.24 per diluted share, for the corresponding prior year periods. The dividends paid to preferred stockholders were 1.0 million and 3.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 On October 17, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of 0.20 per share. The dividend, related to the quarter ended September 30, 2024, will be paid on November 15, 2024 to common stockholders of record on November 4, 2024. The Board also declared a quarterly cash dividend on preferred stock of 0.4375 per depositary share, representing a 1/40th interest in the Series A Preferred Stock. This dividend will be paid on November 15, 2024 to preferred stockholders of record on October 31, 2024. 
 
 1 The talent acquisition of Garden State Home Loans, Inc. was effective August 3, 2024. Additionally, the acquisition of Spring Garden Capital Group, LLC was effective October 1, 2024.

 Analysis of Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends upon the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income included net loan fees of 730,000 and 2.6 million, respectively, as compared to 621,000 and 2.6 million for the same prior year periods, respectively. 
 The following tables set forth certain information relating to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The yields and costs, which are annualized, are derived by dividing the income or expense by the average balance of the related assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown except where noted otherwise. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The yields and costs include certain fees and costs which are considered adjustments to yields.

 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 Total assets decreased by 49.8 million to 13.49 billion, from 13.54 billion, primarily due to decreases in loans, partly offset by an increase in total debt securities. Total loans decreased by 172.4 million to 10.02 billion, from 10.19 billion, primarily due to a decrease in the total commercial portfolio of 188.4 million driven by loan payoffs. The loan pipeline increased by 168.6 million to 351.6 million, from 183.0 million. Loan originations increased 206.4 million to 430.9 million, from 224.5 million, primarily in commercial loans. For more information on the composition of the loan portfolio, see Lending Activities. Held-to-maturity debt securities decreased by 84.6 million to 1.08 billion, from 1.16 billion, primarily due to principal repayments. Debt securities available-for-sale increased 157.9 million to 911.8 million, from 753.9 million, primarily due to new purchases. Other assets decreased by 20.3 million to 159.3 million, from 179.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in market values associated with customer interest rate swap programs. 
 Total liabilities decreased by 82.3 million to 11.79 billion, from 11.88 billion, primarily related to lower deposits offset by a funding mix shift to other borrowings. Deposits decreased by 318.8 million to 10.12 billion, from 10.43 billion, primarily due to decreases in high-yield savings accounts of 326.9 million and time deposits of 224.6 million, offset by increases in money market accounts of 266.8 million. Time deposits decreased to 2.22 billion, from 2.45 billion, representing 22.0 and 23.4 of total deposits, respectively, which was primarily related to planned runoff of brokered time deposits, which decreased by 430.4 million, offset by increases in retail time deposits of 221.4 million. The loan-to-deposit ratio was 99.1 , as compared to 97.7 . FHLB advances increased by 43.2 million to 891.9 million, from 848.6 million, and other borrowings increased by 223.5 million to 419.9 million, from 196.5 million, as a result of lower-cost funding availability. 
 Other liabilities decreased by 43.1 million to 257.6 million, from 300.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in the market values of derivatives associated with customer interest rate swaps and related collateral received from counterparties. 
 Capital levels remain strong and in excess of well-capitalized regulatory levels at September 30, 2024, including the Company s common equity tier one capital ratio, which increased to 11.3 , up approximately 40 basis points from December 31, 2023. 
 Total stockholders equity increased to 1.69 billion, as compared to 1.66 billion, primarily reflecting net income, partially offset by capital returns comprising of dividends and share repurchases.

 5.08 and 4.90 for the corresponding prior year periods. The average balance of interest-earning assets decreased by 152.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to balance sheet contraction. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased by 45.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by securities growth of 153.9 million which was funded through the decrease of 135.4 million of interest-earning deposits and short-term investments and additional borrowings. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 79.3 million and 231.8 million, respectively, from 67.4 million and 165.6 million in the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to an increase in the cost of deposits, partly offset by a decrease in the cost of total borrowings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.20 and 3.12 , respectively, from 2.71 and 2.29 for the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to higher cost of deposits. The total cost of deposits (including non-interest-bearing deposits) increased to 2.44 and 2.37 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 1.99 and 1.48 for the same prior year periods. 
 Net Interest Income and Margin 
 Net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 82.2 million and 250.7 million, respectively, from 91.0 million and 281.9 million in the corresponding prior year periods, primarily reflecting the net impact of the higher interest rate environment. The net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 2.67 and 2.73 , respectively, from 2.91 and 3.09 for the same prior year periods. The net interest margin decreased primarily due to the increase in cost of funds outpacing the increase in yield on average interest-earning assets. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 Provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 517,000 and 4.2 million, respectively, as compared to 10.3 million and 14.5 million for the corresponding prior year periods. The lower provision for the current quarter was a result of flat loan growth, net loan recoveries, and the net effect of shifts in the Company s loan portfolio and external macro economic forecasts. Net loan recoveries were 88,000 and net loan charge-offs were 1.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to net loans charge-offs of 8.3 million for both the same prior year periods. The prior year periods included a partial charge-off of 8.4 million for a single commercial real estate relationship, which was resolved through the sale of the underlying collateral in the current quarter. 
 Non-interest Income 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. September 30, 2023 
 Other income increased to 14.7 million, as compared to 10.8 million. Other income was favorably impacted by net gains on equity investments of 1.4 million and 1.5 million, for the respective quarters, and a 1.4 million gain on sale of a portion of the Company s trust business in the current quarter. The remaining increase of 2.5 million was primarily driven by increases in fees and service charges of 918,000 related to treasury management fees, a non-recurring gain on sale of assets held for sale of 855,000, and net gain on sale of loans of 439,000. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. September 30, 2023 
 Other income increased to 38.0 million, as compared to 21.8 million. The current period was favorably impacted by net gains on equity investments of 4.2 million and a net gain on sale of a portion of its trust business of 2.6 million. The prior year was adversely impacted by a net loss on equity investments of 6.6 million, primarily related to losses on sale of investments. The remaining increase of 2.8 million was primarily driven by increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance of 1.5 million, which included one-time death benefits in the current period, and net gain on sale of loans of 1.2 million, and gain on sale of assets held for sale of 855,000. This was partially offset by a decrease in trust and asset management revenue of 590,000, related to the sale of a portion of the Company s trust business. 
 Non-interest Expense 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. September 30, 2023 
 Operating expenses decreased to 63.7 million, as compared to 64.5 million. The current quarter was adversely impacted by non-core operations related to merger related expenses of 1.7 million. The remaining decrease of 2.4 million was primarily driven by decreases in professional fees of 3.3 million as the Company realized benefits from the performance improvement

 initiatives and investments made in the prior periods. This was partially offset by an increase in other operating expense of 1.1 million, which was partly due to additional loan servicing expenses. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. September 30, 2023 
 Operating expenses decreased to 181.0 million, as compared to 188.7 million. Operating expenses were adversely impacted by 2.1 million related to merger related expenses and an FDIC special assessment in the current year, and merger related and net branch consolidation expenses of 92,000 in the prior year. The remaining decrease of 9.7 million was driven by decreases in professional fees of 8.6 million and compensation and employee benefits expenses of 1.9 million, which were due to the same initiatives discussed in the three-month periods above. This was partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses of 1.3 million, which was partly due to additional loan servicing expenses. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The provision for income taxes was 7.5 million and 25.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 6.5 million and 24.1 million for the same prior year periods. The effective tax rate was 22.9 and 24.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 23.9 and 24.0 for the same prior year periods. The current quarter s effective tax rate was positively impacted by geographic mix as compared to the same prior year period and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was adversely impacted by the non-recurring write-off of a deferred tax asset of 1.2 million net of other state effects. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity Management 
 The Company manages its liquidity and funding needs through its Treasury function and the Asset Liability Committee. The Company has an internal policy that addresses liquidity and management monitors the adherence to policy limits to satisfy current and future cash flow needs. The policy includes internal limits, monitoring of key indicators, deposit concentrations, liquidity sources and availability, stress testing, collateral management, and other qualitative and quantitative metrics. 
 Management monitors cash on a daily basis to determine the liquidity needs of the Bank and OceanFirst Financial Corp. (the Parent Company ), a separate legal entity from the Bank. Additionally, management performs multiple liquidity stress test scenarios on a periodic basis. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank and the Parent Company continued to maintain adequate liquidity under all stress scenarios. The Company also has a detailed contingency funding plan and obtains comprehensive reporting of funding trends on a monthly and quarterly basis, which are reviewed by management. 
 The Company continually evaluates its on-balance sheet liquidity, including cash and unpledged securities and funding capacity at the FHLB and FRB Discount Window, and periodically tests each of its lines of credit. As of September 30, 2024, total on-balance sheet liquidity and funding capacity was 4.0 billion. 
 The Company has a highly operational and granular deposit base, with long-standing client relationships across multiple customer segments providing stable funding. The vast majority of the government deposits are protected by the FDIC insurance as well as the State of New Jersey under the Government Unit Deposit Protection Act, which requires uninsured government deposits to be further collateralized by the Bank. At September 30, 2024, the Bank reported in its Call Report 5.70 billion of estimated uninsured deposits. This total included 2.46 billion of collateralized government deposits and 1.58 billion of intercompany deposits of fully consolidated subsidiaries, leaving estimated adjusted uninsured deposits of 1.66 billion, or 16.3 of total deposits. On-balance-sheet liquidity and funding capacity represented 242.3 of the estimated adjusted uninsured deposits. 
 The primary sources of liquidity specifically available to the Parent Company are dividends from the Bank, proceeds from the sale of investments, and the issuance of debt, preferred and common stock. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Parent Company received dividend payments of 69.0 million from the Bank. At September 30, 2024, the Parent Company held 92.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 The Bank s primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and investments, FHLB advances, and other borrowings . While scheduled payments on loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, loan prepayments, and loan and investment sales are greatly influenced by interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The Bank has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises, including lines of credit at multiple financial institutions and access to the FRB discount window.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company pledged 7.40 billion of loans with the FHLB and FRB to enhance the Company s borrowing capacity, which included collateral pledged to the FHLB to obtain a municipal letter of credit to collateralize certain municipal deposits. The Company also pledged 1.22 billion of securities to secure borrowings, enhance borrowing capacity, collateralize its repurchase agreements, and for other purposes required by law. The Company had 891.9 million of FHLB advances, including 60.0 million of overnight borrowings as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 848.6 million of FHLB term advances and no outstanding overnight borrowings from the FHLB at December 31, 2023. The Company had 419.9 million of other borrowings as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 196.5 million at December 31, 2023, as a result of lower cost funding availability. 
 The Com pany s cash needs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily satisfied by the increase in other borrowings and primarily utilized for the reduction of deposits and the purchase of debt securities. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Contractual Obligations 
 In the normal course of business, the Bank routinely enters into various off-balance sheet commitments, primarily relating to the origination and funding of loans. At September 30, 2024, outstanding commitments to originate loans totaled 351.6 million and outstanding undrawn lines of credit totaled 1.41 billion, of which 1.10 billion were commitments to commercial and commercial construction borrowers and 312.3 million were commitments to consumer and residential construction borrowers. Commitments to fund undrawn lines of credit and commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the existing contracts. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company s exposure to credit risk is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company also had various contractual obligations, which included debt obligations of 1.39 billion, including finance lease obligations of 1.5 million, and an additional 17.8 million in operating lease obligations included in other liabilities. The Company expects to have sufficient funds available to meet current commitments in the normal course of business. Time deposits scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled 2.16 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity Used in Stock Repurchases and Cash Dividends 
 Under the Company s stock repurchase program, shares of OceanFirst Financial Corp. common stock may be purchased in the open market and through other privately-negotiated transactions, from time-to-time, depending on market conditions. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock for general corporate purposes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 87,324 and 1,383,238 shares of its common stock, respectively, totaling 1.4 million and 21.5 million, respectively. At September 30, 2024, there were 1,551,200 shares available to be repurchased under the authorized stock repurchase program. 
 Cash dividends on common stock declared and paid during the first nine months of September 30, 2024 were 35.2 million. Cash dividends on preferred stock declared and paid during the first nine months of September 30, 2024 were 3.0 million. 
 The Company s ability to continue to repurchase shares of common stock and pay dividends remain dependent upon capital distributions from the Bank, which may be adversely affected by capital restraints imposed by applicable regulations. If applicable regulations or regulatory bodies prevent the Bank from paying a dividend to the Company, the Company may not have the liquidity necessary to repurchase shares of common stock or pay a dividend in the future or pay a dividend at the same rate as historically paid or be able to meet current debt obligations. Additionally, regulations of the Federal Reserve may prevent the Company from either paying or increasing the cash dividend to common stockholders. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of the Parent Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock, or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 Capital Management 
 The Company manages its capital sources, uses, and expected future needs through its Treasury function and the Asset Liability Committee. The Company has an internal policy that addresses capital and management monitors the adherence to policy limits to satisfy current and future capital needs. The policy includes internal limits, monitoring of key indicators, sources and availability, intercompany transactions, forecasts and stress testing, and other qualitative and quantitative metrics. 
 Additionally, management performs multiple capital stress test scenarios periodically, varying loan growth, earnings, access to the capital markets, credit losses, and mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio, including both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank and Parent Company continued to maintain adequate capital under all

 Lending Activities 
 Loan Portfolio Composition . At September 30, 2024, the Company had total loans outstanding of 10.02 billion, of which 6.12 billion, or 61.0 of total loans, were commercial real estate, multi-family, and land loans (collectively, commercial real estate ). The remainder of the portfolio consisted of: 660.9 million of commercial and industrial loans, or 6.6 of total loans; 3.00 billion of residential real estate loans, or 30.0 of total loans; and 243.0 million of consumer loans, primarily home equity loans and lines of credit, or 2.4 of total loans. 
 Commercial real estate . Th e Bank originates commercial real estate loans that are secured by properties, or properties under construction, that are generally used for busin ess purposes such as office, industrial, multi-family or retail facilities. Commercial real estate loans are provided on owner-occupied properties and on investor-owned properties. At September 30, 2024, of the total commercial real estate portfolio, 5.27 billion or 86.2 was considered investor-owned and 841.9 million or 13.8 was considered owner-occupied. 
 The Bank performs extensive due diligence in underwriting commercial real estate loans due to the larger loan amounts and the riskier nature of such loans. The Bank assesses and mitigates the risk in several ways, including inspection of all such properties and the review of the overall financial condition of the borrower and guarantors, which include, for example, the review of the rent rolls and applicable leases/lease terms and conditions and the verification of income. A tenant analysis and market analysis are part of the underwriting. 
 For investor-owned properties, because repayment is often dependent on the successful management of the properties, repayment of commercial real estate loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. As a result, the Bank is particularly vigilant of this portfolio. The portfolio is highly diversified with loans secured by a variety of property types in multiple geographies and the portfolio exhibits stable credit quality.

 September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Special Mention 85,721 40,385 Substandard 103,384 106,552 
 The increase in special mention loans was primarily due to new downgrades of six commercial relationships totaling 60.4 million, partly offset by four commercial loans totaling 10.1 million, which were upgraded and two commercial loans of 7.8 million migrating to substandard during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in substandard loans was primarily due to nine commercial relationships totaling 27.2 million that were paid off or were upgraded, which was partially offset by new downgrades primarily related to four commercial relationships totaling 16.2 million and the 7.8 million of downgraded special mention loans noted above.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Note 1 to the Company s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ), as supplemented by this report, contains a summary of significant accounting policies. Various elements of these accounting policies, by their nature, are subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. Certain assets are carried on the consolidated statements of financial condition at estimated fair value or the lower of cost or estimated fair value. 
 
 Policies with respect to the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting policy and estimate because of its importance to the presentation of the Company s financial condition and results of operations and high level of subjectivity. The critical accounting policy involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. The use of different judgments, assumptions, and estimates could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition. The critical accounting policy and its application is reviewed periodically, and at least annually, with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 The evaluation of goodwill was a critical accounting estimate in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The Company bypassed the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative test on its annual impairment testing date of August 31, 2024. In addition to the approaches and assumptions disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, the Company considered an additional market approach valuation method, the guideline merged and acquired company method, which utilizes observable transactions of actual prices paid for target companies that operated in comparable industries or markets facing similar risks. This approach requires judgment in the selection of comparable transactions and includes those with similar business activities, and related operating environments. The results of the quantitative assessment indicated that the fair value of the Company s reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, which resulted in no impairment loss at August 31, 2024. 
 Management continued to carefully assess and evaluate all available information for potential triggering events after the August 31 annual testing date, and concluded no triggering events were identified subsequent to the annual test date. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including declines in the market price of the Company s stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows or business disruptions could result in impairments to goodwill in the future, which would result in recording an impairment loss. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Management will continue evaluating the economic conditions at future reporting periods for triggering events. 
 Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2024 
 In June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . The amendments in this ASU clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. In addition, this update introduces new disclosure requirements to provide information about the contractual sales restriction including the nature and remaining duration of the restriction. This update is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company adopted this standard in 2024. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In March 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-02, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Venture (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method . The amendments in this ASU permit reporting entities to account for the tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method. This update is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company adopted this standard in 2024. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Management of Interest Rate Risk IRR 
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company s market risk arises primarily from the IRR inherent in its lending, investment, deposit-taking, and funding activities. The Company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may negatively or positively impact the Company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis. Changes in interest rates may also negatively or positively impact the market value of the Company s investment securities, in particular fixed-rate instruments. Net gains or losses in available-for-sale securities can increase or decrease accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and total stockholders equity. Management actively monitors and manages IRR. The extent of the movement of interest rates, higher or lower, is an uncertainty that could have a substantial impact on the earnings and stockholders equity of the Company. 
 The principal objectives of the IRR management function are to: evaluate the IRR inherent in the Company s business; determine the level of risk appropriate given the Company s business focus, operating and interest rate environment, capital and liquidity requirements, and performance objectives; and manage the risk consistent with Board approved guidelines. The Company s Board maintains an Asset Liability Committee ALCO consisting of members of management, responsible for reviewing asset liability policies and the IRR position. ALCO meets regularly and reports the Company s IRR position and trends to the Board on a regular basis. 
 The Company utilizes a number of strategies to manage IRR including, but not limited to: (1) managing the origination, purchase, sale, and retention of various types of loans with differing IRR profiles; (2) attempting to reduce the overall interest rate sensitivity of liabilities by emphasizing stable relationship-based deposits and longer-term deposits; (3) selectively purchasing interest rate swaps and caps converting the rates for customer loans to manage individual loans and the Bank s overall IRR profile; (4) managing the investment portfolio IRR profile; (5) managing the maturities and rate structures of borrowings and time deposits; and (6) purchasing interest rate swaps to manage overall balance sheet interest rate risk. 
 The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive. Interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of an IRR model, which measures the change in the institution s economic value of equity EVE and net interest income under various interest rate scenarios. EVE is the difference between the net present value of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet contracts. Interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model which measures IRR by modeling the change in EVE and net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios. Modeled assets and liabilities are assumed to reprice at respective repricing or maturity dates. Pricing caps and floors are included in the results, where applicable. The Company uses prepayment expectations set forth by market sources as well as Company generated data where applicable. Generally, cash flows from loans and securities are assumed to be reinvested to maintain a static balance sheet. Other assumptions about balance sheet mix are generally held constant. The Company s interest rate sensitivity should be reviewed in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the 2023 Form 10-K and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and refined in response to changes in the market environment, changes in the Company s balance sheet composition, enhancements in the Company s modeling and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of these results. 
 The Company performs a variety of EVE and twelve-month net interest income sensitivity scenarios. The following table sets forth sensitivity for a specific range of interest rate scenarios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change in Interest Rates in Basis Points Economic Value of Equity Net Interest Income Economic Value of Equity Net Interest Income (Rate Shock) Change Change Change Change 300 (2.8) 2.1 (12.8) (2.2) 200 (1.5) 1.9 (9.1) (1.3) 100 (0.6) 1.4 (5.2) (0.4) Static (100) 0.1 (1.9) 7.0 (0.5) (200) (0.7) (4.3) 8.8 (1.9) (300) (5.1) (7.3) 6.8 (4.2)

Table of Contents 

 The net interest income sensitivity results indicate that at September 30, 2024 the Company was modestly asset sensitive. The change in sensitivity between September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was impacted by an increase in floating-rate securities and term borrowings, a deposit mix shift within non-maturity deposits with lower betas as well as a change in loan prepayments, partially offset by an increase in overnight borrowings and a reduction in short-term time deposits. 
 
 Overall, the measure of EVE at risk decreased in all rate scenarios from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. This decrease was the result of an increase in floating-rate securities and term borrowings, a deposit mix shift within non-maturity deposits with lower betas and longer average lives, as well as a change in loan prepayments. 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the EVE and net interest income IRR measurements. The model requires the making of certain assumptions, which may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. First, the model assumes that the composition of the Company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured. Second, the model assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Third, the model does not take into account the Company s business or strategic plans or any steps it may take to respond to changes in rates. Fourth, prepayment, rate sensitivity, and average life assumptions can have a significant impact on the IRR model results. Lastly, the model utilizes data derived from historical performance. Accordingly, although the above measurements provide an indication of the Company s IRR exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates. Given the unique nature of the post-pandemic interest rate environment and the speed with which interest rates have been changing, the projections noted above on the Company s EVE and net interest income can be expected to significantly differ from actual results. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 The Company monitors the credit quality of debt securities held-to-maturity on a quarterly basis through the use of internal credit analysis supplemented by external credit ratings.

 The Company concluded that no debt securities were impaired at September 30, 2024 based on consideration of several factors. The Company noted that each issuer made all contractually due payments when required. There were no defaults on principal or interest payments, and no interest payments were deferred. Based on management s analysis of each individual security, the issuers appear to have the ability to meet debt service requirements over the life of the security. Furthermore, the net unrealized losses were primarily due to changes in the general credit and interest rate environment and not credit quality. Additionally, the Company has not utilized securities sales as a source of liquidity and the Company s liquidity plans include adequate sources of liquidity outside securities sales.

 The Company categorizes all loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company evaluates risk ratings on an ongoing basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 Pass : Loans classified as Pass are well protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the borrower. 
 Special Mention : Loans classified as Special Mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Company s credit position at some future date. 
 Substandard : Loans classified as Substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Doubtful : Loans classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.

 A loan is considered collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and, therefore, is classified as non-accruing. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had collateral dependent loans with an amortized cost balance as follows: commercial real estate - investor of million and million, respectively, commercial real estate - owner occupied of million and , respectively, and commercial and industrial of and , respectively.

 Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023. Since adoption, the Company has modified and may modify in the future certain loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. These modifications may include a reduction in interest rate, an extension in term, principal forgiveness and/or other than insignificant payment delay. Upon the Company s determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is charged off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount, and the allowance for credit losses is subsequently adjusted by an amount equal to the total loss rate as applied to the reduced amortized cost basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loans with modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty totaled million and million, respectively. There were outstanding commitments to lend additional funds to such borrowers with loan modifications as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

 (1) The estimated fair value of non-maturity deposits does not consider any inherent value and represents the amount payable on demand. However, non-maturity deposits do contain significant inherent value to the Company, particularly when overnight funding costs are greater than the deposit costs. 
 
 Limitations 
 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because a limited market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other significant unobservable inputs. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
 Fair value estimates are based on existing balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include premises and equipment, bank owned life insurance, deferred tax assets and goodwill. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

 Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 During 2022, the Company entered into a interest rate swap intended to add stability to its net interest income and to manage its exposure to future interest rate movements associated with a pool of floating-rate commercial loans. The swap requires the Company to pay variable-rate amounts indexed to one-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR to the counterparty in exchange for the receipt of fixed-rate amounts at from the counterparty. The swap was designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are initially reported in other comprehensive income. Amounts are subsequently reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings when the hedged transactions occur, specifically within the same line item as the hedged item (interest income). Therefore, a portion of the balance reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income as interest payments are made or received on the Company s interest rate swaps.) ) ) ) Unrealized gains (losses) recognized in OCI ) ) ) Losses reclassified from AOCI into interest income AOCI (AOCL) balance at end of period, net of tax ) )

 Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features 
 The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the interest rate derivative counterparty. The Company minimizes this risk by being a party to International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements with third-party broker-dealers that require a minimum dollar transfer amount upon a margin call. This requirement is dependent on certain specified credit measures. The amount of collateral posted with third parties was at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The amount of collateral received from third parties was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The amount of collateral posted with third parties and received from third parties is deemed to be sufficient to collateralize both the fair market value change as well as any additional amounts that may be required as a result of a change in the specified credit measures. The aggregate fair value of all derivative financial instruments in a liability position with credit measure contingencies and entered into with third parties was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The interest rate derivatives which the Company executes with the commercial borrowers are collateralized by the borrowers commercial real estate financed by the Company.

 The calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities are impacted by the lease term and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease agreements often include or more options to renew the lease at the Company s discretion. If the exercise of a renewal option is considered to be reasonably certain, the Company includes the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. For the discount rate, ASC Topic 842, Leases requires the Company to use the rate implicit in the lease, provided the rate is readily determinable. As this rate is not readily determinable, the Company generally utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, at lease inception, over a similar term. For operating leases existing prior to January 1, 2019, the Company used the incremental borrowing rate for the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019. For the finance lease, the Company utilized its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception.
