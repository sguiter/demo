EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 Apartment Investment and Management Company Aimco or the Company ), a Maryland corporation, is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. On December 15, 2020, Aimco completed the separation of its businesses (the Separation ), creating two, separate and distinct, publicly traded companies, Aimco and Apartment Income REIT Corp. AIR (Aimco and AIR together, as they existed prior to the Separation, Aimco Predecessor ). Events noted in this filing as occurring before December 15, 2020, were those entered into by Aimco Predecessor. 
 Aimco, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the general partner and is, directly, the special limited partner of Aimco OP L.P. ("Aimco Operating Partnership"). As of September 30, 2024, Aimco owned 92.3 of the legal interest in the common partnership units of Aimco Operating Partnership and 94.7 of the economic interest in Aimco Operating Partnership. The remaining 7.7 legal interest is owned by limited partners. The common partnership units of Aimco Operating Partnership are referred to as "OP Units". As the sole general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership, Aimco has exclusive control of Aimco Operating Partnership s day-to-day management. 
 Aimco Operating Partnership holds all of Aimco s assets and manages the daily operations of Aimco s business. Pursuant to the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement, Aimco is required to contribute to Aimco Operating Partnership all proceeds from the offerings of its securities. In exchange for the contribution of such proceeds, Aimco receives additional interests in Aimco Operating Partnership with similar terms (e.g., if Aimco contributes proceeds of a stock offering, Aimco receives partnership units with terms substantially similar to the stock issued by Aimco). 
 This filing combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, of Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership. Where it is important to distinguish between the two entities, we refer to them specifically. Otherwise, references to we, us, or our mean, collectively, Aimco, Aimco Operating Partnership, and their consolidated entities. 
 We believe combining the periodic reports of Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits: 
 We present our business as a whole, in the same manner our management views and operates the business; 

We eliminate duplicative disclosure and provide a more streamlined and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosures apply to both Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership; and 

We save time and cost through the preparation of a single combined report rather than two separate reports. 

We operate Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership as one enterprise; the management of Aimco directs the management and operations of Aimco Operating Partnership; and Aimco OP GP, LLC, Aimco Operating Partnership s general partner, is managed by Aimco. 
 We believe it is important to understand the few differences between Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership in the context of how Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. Aimco has no assets or liabilities other than its investment in Aimco Operating Partnership. Also, Aimco is a corporation that issues publicly traded equity from time to time, whereas Aimco Operating Partnership is a partnership that has no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from stock offerings by Aimco, which are contributed to Aimco Operating Partnership in exchange for additional limited partnership interests (of a similar type and in an amount equal to the shares of stock sold in the offering), Aimco Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by its business. These sources include Aimco Operating Partnership s working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under its revolving credit facility, the issuance of debt and equity securities, including additional partnership units, and proceeds received from the sale of real estate. 
 Equity, partners capital, and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the condensed consolidated financial statements of Aimco and those of Aimco Operating Partnership. Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership held by entities other than Aimco are classified within partners capital in Aimco Operating Partnership s condensed consolidated financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Aimco s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 To help investors understand the differences between Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership, this report provides: separate condensed consolidated financial statements for Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership; a single set of condensed consolidated notes to such financial statements that includes separate discussions of each entity s stockholders equity or partners capital, and earnings per share or earnings per unit, as applicable; and a combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that includes discrete information related to each entity, where appropriate.

This report also includes separate Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership are both compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and 18 U.S.C. 1350.

, and , respectively. Substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Aimco are held by Ai mco Operating Partnership. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships Redeemable noncontrolling interests consist of equity interests held by a limited partner in a consolidated real estate partnership that has the right to require such partnership to redeem all or a portion of the noncontrolling interest in accordance with the partnership agreement. If a consolidated real estate partnership includes redemption rights that are not within our control, the noncontrolling interest is included as temporary equity. Redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships as of September 30, 2024, consists of the following: (i) a preferred equity interest in an entity that owns a portfolio of operating apartment communities, (ii) equity interests in two separate consolidated joint ventures with residential apartment communities in lease-up, and (iii) a preferred equity interest in an entity that owns a waterfront ground-up development. Capital contributions, distributions, and net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships are determined in accordance with the relevant partnership agreements. These interests are presented as Redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. The assets of our consolidated real estate partnerships must first be used to settle the liabilities of the consolidated real estate partnerships. The consolidated real estate partnership s creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of Aimco Operating Partnership.

 , million mezzanine loan to the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments located in southwest San Francisco (the Mezzanine Investment ). The loan bears interest at a annual rate, accruing if not paid from property operations. Legal ownership of the subsidiaries that originated and hold the Mezzanine Investment was retained by AIR following the Separation. The Separation Agreement with AIR provides for AIR to transfer ownership of the subsidiaries that originated and hold the Mezzanine Investment, and a related equity option to acquire a interest in the partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments. At the time of Separation and as of the date of this filing, legal title of these subsidiaries had not yet transferred to us. Until legal title of the subsidiaries is transferred, AIR is obligated to pass payments received on the Mezzanine Investment to us, and we are obligated to indemnify AIR against any costs and expenses related thereto. We have the risks and rewards of ownership of the Mezzanine Investment. The carrying value of the Mezzanine Investment was zero as of September 30, 2024. In June 2023, we closed on the sale of a non-controlling participation in the Mezzanine Investment for million. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we receive a first priority return from any payments made to service or pay down the Mezzanine Investment equal to million plus no less than a annualized return as well as of any residual payments after the purchaser receives a annualized return on its subordinate investment. Additionally, we are responsible for the servicing and administration of the Mezzanine Investment.

We account for our investment in IQHQ using the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the investment is measured at cost less impairment if any needed, with subsequent adjustments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer since it does not have a readily determinable fair value. In 2022, after fully funding our commitment, of our original investment in IQHQ was redeemed for million. Our remaining investment in IQHQ, with a cost basis of million, was adjusted upward to million at the same per share value as the cash redemption per share. During the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the investment in IQHQ to million. We did not record additional impairment during the three months ended September 30, 2024. impairment losses were recognized during the period ended September 30, 2023 .

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an income tax benefit of million, compared to income tax benefit of million during the same period in 2023. The decrease is due primarily to a change in estimate associated with finalizing the 2022 tax returns in the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an income tax benefit of million, compared to income tax benefit of million during the same period in 2023 . The decrease is due primarily to a change in estimate associated with finalizing the 2022 tax returns in third quarter of 2023, partially offset by the tax effect of fewer gains, increased depreciation, and interest expense associated with properties owned by, and activities of, our TRS entities.

As of September 30, 2024, we have remaining commitments of million related to our investments in property technology funds invested in entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry. The timing of the remaining funding of these commitments is uncertain. We also enter into certain commitments for future purchases of goods and services in connection with the operations of our apartment communities. Those commitments generally have terms of or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures. Legal Matters From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings, incidental to the normal course of business. While the outcome of the legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe there are no legal proceedings pending that would have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

Aimco's time-based restricted stock awards receive non-forfeitable dividends similar to shares of Common Stock and OP Units prior to vesting, and our market-based long-term incentive partnership units ("LTIP Units") receive non-forfeitable distributions based on specified percentages of the distributions paid to OP Units prior to vesting and conversion. The unvested restricted shares and units related to these awards are participating securities. When applicable, we include the effect of participating securities in basic and diluted earnings per share and unit computations using the two-class method of allocating distributed and undistributed earnings when the two-class method is more dilutive than the treasury stock method. Participating securities were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share and unit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, because the effect of their inclusion would have been antidilutive. As of September 30, 2024, participating securities that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share or unit in future periods totaled million.)

 Fair Value Disclosures We believe that the carrying value of the consolidated amounts of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximated their fair value as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 and are categorized within Level 1 of the GAAP fair value hierarchy. We estimate the fair value of our debt using an income and market approach, including comparison of the contractual terms to observable and unobservable inputs such as market interest rate risk spreads, contractual interest rates, remaining periods to maturity, debt service coverage ratios, and loan to value ratios. We classify the fair value of our non-recourse property debt and non-recourse construction loans within Level 2 of the GAAP valuation hierarchy based on the significance of certain observable inputs used to estimate their fair value.

 million related to our passive equity investment in IQHQ. This impairment charge was derived using a third-party valuation of IQHQ, which incorporated fair value estimates of properties owned by IQHQ. The fair value estimates of the properties owned by IQHQ were determined by discounted cash flow analyses and references to market comparable data. The cash flows utilized in such discounted cash flow analyses are comprised of projected operating results, which are based upon market conditions and future expectations. The most significant unobservable inputs utilized in determining the fair value of these assets are capitalization rates and discount rates, which ranged from to and to , respectively. Because of these inputs, we have determined that the fair value of these properties are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Market comparable data utilizes comparable sales, which are subject to judgment as to comparability to the valued properties. Because these inputs are derived from observable market data, we have determined that the fair values of these properties are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Unconsolidated real estate partnerships In March 2022, we acquired an ownership interest in an unconsolidated investment in land held for development in the Edgewater neighborhood of Miami, Florida, in exchange for land that we had purchased for million in January 2022 and cash of million. Subsequently, we had additional non-cash contributions of million for unused transferable density rights and cash contributions of million. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we exercised our rights under the existing joint venture agreement, whereby our joint venture partner agreed to purchase our ownership interest in this unconsolidated investment. As a result of the transaction, we have recognized a non-cash other than temporary impairment ("OTTI") of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, within Other income (expense), net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. We reduced our carrying value of the investment to the expected cash proceeds of approximately million, subject to certain adjustments, to be received in the fourth quarter of 2024. We determined this is a nonrecurring fair value measurement of the unconsolidated investment classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

 unconsolidated VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary because we are not their primary decision maker. The eight unconsolidated VIEs include four unconsolidated real estate partnerships that hold apartment communities in San Diego, California, the Mezzanine Investment, our passive equity investment in IQHQ, and two unconsolidated investments in land held for development in Miami, Florida and Bethesda, Maryland. Our maximum exposure to loss because of our involvement with the unconsolidated VIEs is limited to the carrying value of their assets.

In September 2024, we secured a million preferred equity commitment from a third-party for the development of a luxury water-front rental development, located at 640 NE 34th Street in Miami, Florida. In addition, we secured a non-recourse construction loan commitment for up to million that has a maturity date of , prior to the consideration of a one year extension option. As a result, we performed a reassessment of the entity that owns the property located at 640 NE 34th Street, concluding that it became a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary. While the consolidation status did not change as it was already consolidated prior to the VIE assessment, its assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 have been incorporated in the table above.

Our apartment home leases are generally renewable at the end of the lease term, subject to potential changes in rental rates, and our commercial space leases generally have renewal options, subject to associated increases in rental rates due to market based or fixed price renewal options and other certain conditions. We have a sublease arrangement providing space within our corporate office for fixed rents, which commenced on and expires on . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized sublease income of million and m illion, respectively, compared to million and million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

segments: (i) Development and Redevelopment; (ii) Operating; and (iii) Other. Our Development and Redevelopment segment consists of rental communities that are under construction or have not achieved stabilization, as well as land held for development. As of September 30, 2024 , our Development and Redevelopment segment consists of properties, including two of which were under construction and two substantially completed and in lease-up. Our Operating segment includes residential apartment communities with apartment homes that have achieved a stabilized level of operations as of January 1, 2023 and maintained it throughout the current year and comparable period in the prior year. We aggregate all our apartment communities that have reached stabilization into our Operating segment. During the first quarter of 2024, we revised the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") to assess our operating performance. As a result, we reclassified The Benson Hotel from the Development and Redevelopment segment to the Other segment. In addition, during the first quarter of 2024, we disposed of St. George Villas, which was previously reported within our Other segment. Prior period segment information has been recast based upon our current segment population, and is consistent with how our CODM evaluates the business. Our Other segment consists of properties currently owned that are not included in our Development and Redevelopment or Operating segments. Our Other segment includes 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, our only office building, and The Benson Hotel, our only hotel. Our CODM uses cash flow, construction timeline to completion, and actual versus budgeted results to evaluate our properties in our Development and Redevelopment segment. Our CODM uses proportionate property net operating income to assess the operating performance of our Operating segment. Proportionate property net operating income is defined as our share of rental and other property revenues, excluding utility reimbursements, less direct property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements, for the consolidated communities; but excluding the results of apartment communities with an aggregate apartment homes that we neither manage nor consolidate, our investment in IQHQ, the Mezzanine Investment, and investments in real estate technology funds; and 

 excluding property management costs and casualty gains or losses, reported in consolidated amounts, in our assessment of segment performance.

 Executive Overview 
 Our mission is to make real estate investments, primarily focused on the multifamily sector within targeted U.S. markets, where outcomes are enhanced through our human capital and substantial value is created for investors, teammates, and the communities in which we operate. 
 Our value proposition includes our: 
 Platform, consisting of a cohesive, talented, and tenured team with diverse real estate industry experience combined with a disciplined and proven investment process; 

Diversified portfolio, consisting of value-add investments, a pipeline of land held for potential future development, a national portfolio of stabilized multifamily real estate and limited indirect and passive investments; and 

Capital redeployment plan which includes the prudent recycling of capital, reallocating our equity to higher returning investments, and return of capital to stockholders when appropriate. 

Our primary goal is outsized risk adjusted returns and accelerating growth for our stockholders. We are focused on providing superior total-return performance to stockholders, primarily through capital appreciation driven by accretive investment and active portfolio management over multi-year periods. We do not presently intend to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend, but may periodically pay dividends for REIT tax purposes or to return a portion of profits to stockholders. 
 Our financial objectives are to create value and produce superior, asset level, risk-adjusted returns on equity as measured by the investment period Internal Rate of Return IRR and the project-level Multiple on Invested Capital MOIC ). We measure broader performance based on Net Asset Value NAV growth over time. 
 Our capital allocation strategy is designed to leverage our investment platform and optimize risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. 
 We target a balanced allocation, which includes investments in Value Add and Opportunistic multifamily real estate, primarily located in Southeast Florida, the Washington, D.C. Metro Area and Colorado's Front Range, plus investment in a geographically diversified portfolio of "Core" and "Core-Plus" apartment communities. 
 In addition, we currently hold select alternative assets, consisting primarily of indirect, real estate related debt and equity investments. We have reduced our allocation to these investments and plan to continue to significantly reduce our allocation over time. 
 We have policies in place that support our stated strategy, guide our investment allocations, and manage risk, including to hold at all times a sizable portion of our net equity in stabilized cash-flowing assets and to require cash or committed credit necessary for completion of development and redevelopment projects prior to their commencement.

Table of Contents 

 Given our stated strategy, it is expected that at any point in time the value-creation process will be ongoing at numerous of our investments. Over time, we expect our enterprise to produce superior returns on equity on a risk-adjusted basis and it is our plan to do so by: 
 Benefiting from a national platform while leveraging local and regional expertise 

We have corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado and Washington, D.C. Our investment platform is managed by experienced professionals based in three regions, where we will focus our new investment activity: Southeast Florida, the Washington, D.C. Metro Area and Colorado's Front Range. By regionalizing this platform, we are able to leverage the in-depth local market knowledge of each regional leader, creating a comparative advantage when sourcing, evaluating, and executing investment opportunities. 
 Owning a portfolio of stabilized core and core plus real estate 

Our entire portfolio of operating properties includes 25 apartment communities (21 consolidated properties and four unconsolidated properties) with average rents in line with local market averages (generally defined as B class). We also own one commercial office building that is part of an assemblage with an adjacent apartment building. The target composition of our stabilized portfolio will continue to include primarily B multifamily assets, spread across a geographically diversified portfolio, with a bias toward long established residential neighborhoods that rank highly in regard to schools, employment fundamentals and state and regional governance. Core-Plus opportunities offer the opportunity for incremental capital investment while maintaining stabilized cashflow to accelerate income growth and improve asset values. 
 Managing and investing in value-add and opportunistic real estate 

Our dedicated team will source and execute development and redevelopment projects, and various other direct investment strategies. Our development and redevelopment portfolio currently includes projects in construction and lease-up. In addition, our team has secured significant, high-quality, future development opportunities, including total potential of more than 11 million gross square feet, located in high-growth markets. Generally, we seek direct investment opportunities in locations where barriers to entry are high, target customers can be clearly defined and where we have a comparative advantage over others in the market. From time to time, we may choose to monetize certain pipeline assets prior to vertical construction in an effort to maximize value and risk adjusted returns. In any time period, the amount of our capital that is allocated to development activities may vary based on market conditions and other factors. 
 Maintaining sufficient liquidity and utilizing safe financial leverage 

We will guard our liquidity at all times by maintaining sufficient cash and committed credit. 
 From time to time, we will allocate capital to financial assets designed to mitigate risks. Existing examples include our use of interest rate caps to provide protection against increases in interest rates on in-place loans. 
 We expect to capitalize our activities through a combination of non-recourse property debt, non-recourse construction loans, third-party equity, and the recycling of our equity, including retained earnings. We plan to limit the use of recourse leverage, with a strong preference towards non-recourse property-level debt to limit risk to our enterprise. When warranted, we plan to seek equity capital from joint venture partners to improve our cost of capital, further leverage our equity, reduce exposure to a single investment and, in certain cases, for strategic benefits.

 The results from the execution of our business plan during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are further described below. 
 Financial Results and Recent Highlights 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders per share, on a fully dilutive basis, was 0.16), due primarily to higher net contributions from multifamily property operations offset by increases in interest expense and depreciation related to advancing and completing development projects. For the same period in 2023, net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders per share, on a fully dilutive basis, was 0.02). 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue and net operating income from our Operating segment were up 4.1 and 1.6 respectively, year-over-year, due primarily to higher average monthly revenue per apartment home of 2,415, up 57 year-over-year, and a 160-basis point increase in Average Daily Occupancy to 96.8 . 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we substantially completed construction on our Strathmore Square project located in Bethesda, Maryland and began construction on an ultra-luxury residential tower located at 640 34th Street ("34th Street") in the Edgewater neighborhood of Miami, Florida. 

Operating Property Results 
 We own a diversified portfolio of stabilized apartment communities located in eight major U.S. markets with average rents in line with local market averages (generally defined as B class). We also own a commercial office building that is part of an assemblage with an adjacent apartment building. 
 Highlights for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include: 
 Revenue for our Operating segment was 39.3 million, up 4.1 year-over-year, resulting from a 57 increase in average monthly revenue per apartment home to 2,415 and a 160-basis point increase in Average Daily Occupancy to 96.8 . 

Expenses for our Operating segment were 11.9 million, up 10.6 year-over-year primarily from higher real estate taxes and insurance. 

Net operating income for our Operating segment was 27.4 million, up 1.6 year-over-year. 

Value Add, Opportunistic Alternative Investments 
 Development and Redevelopment 
 We generally seek development and redevelopment opportunities where barriers to entry are high, target customers can be clearly defined, and where we have a comparative advantage over others in the market. Our Value Add and Opportunistic investments may also target portfolio acquisitions, operational turnarounds, and re-entitlements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had two multifamily development projects under construction, two multifamily communities that have been substantially completed and are now in lease-up, and a hotel that was completed in 2023 and is being stabilized. These projects remain on track, as measured by construction budget and lease-up metrics. Additionally, we have a pipeline of future value-add opportunities in our target markets of Southeast Florida, the Washington, D.C. Metro Area, and Colorado's Front Range. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 29.6 million and 102.2 million of capital was invested in development and redevelopment activities, respectively, primarily funded through construction loan draws, compared to 74.4 million and 220.4 million, respectively, during the same periods in 2023. 
 Highlights for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include: 
 In the third quarter, construction began in Miami s Edgewater neighborhood on 34th Street, an ultra-luxury waterfront residential tower that will include a highly tailored amenity package and approximately 7,000 square feet of ground floor retail space. The rental homes will average more than 2,500 square feet, feature 9 10 foot ceilings, oversized private terraces, top-of-the-line finishes, and unobstructed views of Biscayne Bay. 

In Upper Northwest Washington, D.C., construction is substantially complete at Upton Place. As of September 30, 2024, we have delivered all 689 apartment homes with 284 units leased or pre-leased at rental rates greater than underwriting. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, 90 of the project's 105,000 square feet of retail space has been leased.

Table of Contents 

 In Bethesda, Maryland, construction is substantially complete at the first phase of Strathmore Square. As of September 30, 2024, we have delivered all 220 highly tailored apartment homes with 64 units leased or preleased with rents ahead of our initial projections, and 46 homes were occupied. 

In Corte Madera, CA, construction is ongoing at Oak Shore where 16 luxury single family rental homes and eight accessory dwelling units are being developed. As of September 30, 2024, 19 residences had been delivered with 14 leased or pre-leased at rental rates greater than underwriting. 

In the third quarter of 2024, we invested 0.4 million into programming, design, documentation, and entitlement efforts related to select pipeline projects located in South Florida and on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado. 

Investment and Disposition Activity 
 We are focused on prudently allocating capital and delivering strong investment returns. Consistent with our capital allocation philosophy, we monetize the value within our assets when accretive uses of the proceeds are identified and invest when the risk adjusted returns are superior to other uses of capital. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, no new investment or disposition activity occurred. 
 Balance Sheet and Financing Activities 
 We are highly focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, including having at all times ample liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, we had access to 260.4 million in liquidity, including 82.6 million of cash on hand, 27.8 million of restricted cash, and the capacity to borrow up to 150.0 million on our revolving credit facility. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information regarding our leverage. 
 Financial Results of Operations 
 We have three segments: (i) Development and Redevelopment, (ii) Operating, and (iii) Other. 
 Our Development and Redevelopment segment consists of rental communities that are under construction or have not achieved and maintained stabilization throughout the current year and comparable period in the prior year, as well as land assemblages that are being held for future development. Our Operating segment includes 21 residential apartment communities that have achieved stabilized levels of operations as of January 1, 2023, and maintained it throughout the current year and comparable period in the prior year. Our Other segment consists of properties that are not included in our Development and Redevelopment or Operating segments. 
 The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. 
 Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders decreased by 19.7 million and 78.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, as described more fully below. 
 Property Results 
 As of September 30, 2024, our Development and Redevelopment segment includes 10 properties, including two of which were under construction and two substantially completed and in lease-up. Our Operating segment includes 21 residential apartment communities with approximately 5,600 apartment homes, and our Other segment includes 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, our only office building, and The Benson Hotel, our only hotel. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, we revised the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") to assess our operating performance. As a result, we reclassified The Benson Hotel from the Development and Redevelopment segment to the Other segment. In addition, during the first quarter of 2024, we disposed of St. George Villas, which was previously reported within our Other segment. Prior period segment information has been recast based upon our current segment population, and is consistent with how our CODM evaluates the business. The recast conforms with our reportable segment classification as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 We use proportionate property net operating income to assess the operating performance of our segments. Proportionate property net operating income is defined as our share of rental and other property revenues, excluding utility reimbursements, less direct property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements, for the consolidated communities; but 
 excluding the results of four apartment communities with an aggregate 142 apartment homes that we neither manage nor consolidate, our investment in IQHQ, the Mezzanine Investment, and investments in real estate technology funds; and 

excluding property management costs and casualty gains or losses, reported in consolidated amounts, in our assessment of segment performance. 

Please refer to Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for further discussion regarding our segments, including a reconciliation of these proportionate amounts to consolidated rental and other property revenues and property operating expenses.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023: 
 Development and Redevelopment proportionate property net operating income increased by 0.2 million, or 10.1 , due primarily to the delivery and initial lease-up of Upton Place and Strathmore Square. 

Operating proportionate property net operating income increased by 0.4 million, or 1.6 . The increase was attributable primarily to a 1.6 million, or 4.1 increase in rental and other property revenues due to a 57 increase in average monthly revenue per apartment home to 2,415, and a 160-basis point increase in Average Daily Occupancy to 96.8 . 

Other proportionate property net operating income decreased by 0.5 million, or 30.0 . The decrease was due primarily to vacated space at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive.

Table of Contents 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023: 
 Development and Redevelopment proportionate property net operating income increased by 2.0 million, or 38.8 , due primarily to the lease up of delivered apartment homes. 

Operating proportionate property net operating income increased by 3.1 million, or 4.0 . The increase was attributable primarily to a 5.2 million, or 4.7 increase in rental and other property revenues due to a 93 increase in average monthly revenue per apartment home to 2,385. 

Other proportionate property net operating income increased by 0.2 million, or 3.9 . The increase was due primarily to additional revenue in 2024 at The Benson Hotel partially offset by lower revenue at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive. 

Non-Segment Real Estate Operations 
 Operating income amounts not attributed to our segments include property management costs, casualty losses, and, if applicable, the results of apartment communities sold or held for sale, reported in consolidated amounts, which we do not allocate to our segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 5.7 million, or 32.2 due primarily to the substantial completion of Upton Place and Strathmore Square in 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, Depreciation and amortization expense increased 14.0 million, or 27.4 due primarily to the substantial completion of Upton Place and Strathmore Square, as well as the completion of The Benson Hotel during the second quarter of 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.4 million, or 5.5 , and 0.6 million, or 2.5 , respectively, due primarily to a decrease in expenses for consulting services per the Master Services Agreement with AIR, which concluded at December 31, 2023. 
 Interest Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, Interest income decreased by 0.2 million, or 7.5 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, Interest income increased by 0.5 million, or 6.6 . These changes were primarily due to interest earned on seller financing provided in connection with the sale of a land parcel in December 2023, partially offset by a reduction in invested cash. 
 Interest Expense 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, Interest expense increased by 10.8 million and 21.6 million, respectively, due primarily to increased non-recourse construction loan draws and reduced capitalization as development projects are advanced and completed, partially offset by the repayment of certain non-recourse property debt in 2023 . 
 Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Interest Rate Contracts 
 We are required to adjust our interest rate contracts to fair value on a quarterly basis. As a result of the mark-to-market adjustments, we recorded unrealized losses of 2.6 million and 4.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to unrealized losses of 0.5 million and unrealized gains of 0.1 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. In addition, we realized gains of 1.5 million and 5.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to realized gains of 1.5 million and 3.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. 
 Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments 
 We measure our investments in stock based on its market price at period end and our investments in property technology funds at NAV as a practical expedient. In addition, we measure our investment in IQHQ at cost, less impairment if any needed, with subsequent adjustments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer since it does not have a readily determinable fair value. As a result of changes in the values of these investments, we recorded unrealized losses of 0.6 million and 48.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the second 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 quarter of 2024, we recognized a 47.0 million non-cash impairment on our investment in IQHQ. For the same periods in 2023, we recorded unrealized losses of 1.1 million and unrealized gains of 0.2 million, respectively. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net , includes costs associated with our risk management activities, partnership administration expenses, fee income, and certain non-recurring items, as well as activity related to our Mezzanine Investment and Unconsolidated real estate partnerships. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, Other income (expense), net changed by 1.9 million, or 95.0 , primarily due to a non-cash other than temporary impairment recognized on our investment in an unconsolidated investment in land held for development in the current period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, Other income (expense), net changed by 0.1 million, or 0.8 , primarily due to the incremental expense associated with pre-existing long-term incentive partnership units recorded upon the resignation of one of our board members in the prior period, partially offset by a non-cash other than temporary impairment recognized on our investment in an unconsolidated investment in land held for development in the current period. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
 Certain aspects of our operations, including our development and redevelopment activities, are conducted through TRS entities. Additionally, our TRS entities hold investments in one of our apartment communities and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive. 
 Our income tax benefit (expense) calculated in accordance with GAAP includes income taxes associated with the income or loss of our TRS entities. Income taxes, as well as changes in valuation allowance and incremental deferred tax items in conjunction with intercompany asset transfers and internal restructurings (if applicable), are included in Income tax benefit (expense) in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations . 
 Consolidated GAAP income or loss subject to tax consists of pretax income or loss of our taxable entities and income and gains retained by the REIT. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had consolidated net losses subject to tax of 9.7 million and 21.6 million, respectively, compared to consolidated net losses subject to tax of 5.0 million and 12.4 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an income tax benefit of 3.8 million, compared to an income tax benefit of 6.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is due primarily to a change in estimate associated with finalizing the 2022 tax returns in the third quarter of 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an income tax benefit of 8.7 million, compared to an income tax benefit of 10.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is due primarily to a change in estimate associated with finalizing the 2022 tax returns in third quarter of 2023, partially offset by the tax effect of fewer gains, increased depreciation, and interest expense associated with properties owned by, and activities of, our TRS entities.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates that involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are detailed in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of Aimco s and Aimco Operating Partnership s combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates from those reported in our Form 10-K, other than as noted in our Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, and we believe that the related judgments and assessments have been consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly depicts the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for all periods presented. 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 We use EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance. These key financial indicators are non-GAAP measures and are defined and described below. We provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP. 
 Earnings Before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate ("EBITDAre") 
 EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP measures, which we believe are useful to investors, creditors, and rating agencies as a supplemental measure of our ability to incur and service debt because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and allow for comparison of our credit strength to different companies. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of liquidity. There can be no assurance that our method of calculating EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Nareit defines EBITDAre as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense, further adjusted for: 
 gains and losses on the dispositions of depreciated property; 

impairment write-downs of depreciated property; 

impairment write-downs of investments in unconsolidated partnerships caused by a decrease in the value of the depreciated property in such partnerships; and 

adjustments to reflect our share of EBITDAre of investments in unconsolidated entities. 

EBITDAre is defined by Nareit and provides for an additional performance measure independent of capital structure for greater comparability between real estate investment trusts. We define Adjusted EBITDAre as EBITDAre adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items: 
 net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships and EBITDAre adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests; 

realized and unrealized (gains) losses on interest rate contracts, which we believe allow investors to compare a measure of our earnings before the effects of our capital structure and indebtedness with that of other companies in the real estate industry; and 

the non-cash (income) loss recognized on our Mezzanine Investment. 

the non-cash (income) loss recognized on a passive equity investment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our loan agreements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our available liquidity was 260.4 million, which consisted of: 
 82.6 million in cash and cash equivalents; 

27.8 million of restricted cash, including amounts related to tenant security deposits and escrows held by lenders for capital additions, property taxes, and insurance; and 

150.0 million of available capacity to borrow under our revolving secured credit facility. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had sufficient capacity on our non-recourse construction loans to cover our remaining commitments on development and redevelopment projects of approximately 163.7 million. We also have unfunded commitments in the amount of 1.5 million related to four investments in entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry. Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, and future investments. Additionally, our third-party property managers may enter into commitments on our behalf to purchase goods and services in connection with the operation of our apartment communities and our office building. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to historical levels. 
 We believe, based on the information available at this time, that we have sufficient cash on hand and access to additional sources of liquidity to meet our operational needs for the next twelve months.

Table of Contents 

 In the event that our cash and cash equivalents, revolving secured credit facility, and cash provided by operating activities are not sufficient to cover our liquidity needs, we have the means to generate additional liquidity, such as from additional property financing activity and proceeds from apartment community sales. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, including debt maturities, development and redevelopment spending, and future investment activity, primarily through property financing activity, cash generated from operations, and the recycling of our equity. Our revolving secured credit facility matures in December 2024, prior to consideration of its one-year extension option that we intend to exercise. 
 Leverage and Capital Resources 
 The availability and cost of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Any adverse changes in the lending environment could negatively affect our liquidity. We have taken steps to mitigate a portion of our short-term refunding risk. However, if property or development financing options become unavailable, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in capital spending or apartment community dispositions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 90 of our outstanding non-recourse property debt had a fixed interest rate and approximately 10 had a variable interest rate, all of which was hedged. In addition, the weighted-average contractual rate on our non-recourse debt was 4.8 and 4.6 inclusive of interest rate caps, and the average remaining term to maturity was 5.9 years. Our use of interest rate caps may vary from quarter to quarter depending on lender requirements, recycling of interest rate caps between projects, and our view on forecasted interest rates. 
 While our primary sources of leverage are property-level debt and non-recourse construction loans, we also have a secured 150.0 million credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving secured credit facility, which requires that we maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25X, minimum tangible net worth of 625.0 million, and maximum leverage of 60.0 as defined in the credit agreement. We are currently in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants during the next twelve months. 
 Changes in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash 
 The following discussion relates to changes in consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 1 of this report. 
 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 46.2 million. Our operating cash flow is primarily affected by rental rates, occupancy levels, operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment communities and general and administrative costs. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 3.6 million compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to increased net operating income driven by higher rents and the timing of balance sheet position changes, partially offset by increased interest expense. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities of 114.4 million consisted primarily of capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 149.8 million compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to decreased capital expenditures and the purchase of a short-term treasury bill in the prior period. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities of 39.3 million consisted primarily of proceeds from non-recourse construction loans, offset by common stock repurchases and distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interests. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 68.3 million compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to decreased proceeds from non-recourse construction loans, the sale of a participation in the Mezzanine Investment and the monetization of interest rate options in the prior period, offset by decreased principal repayments on non-recourse property debt. 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 Future Capital Needs 
 We expect to fund any future acquisitions, development and redevelopment, and other capital spending principally with operating cash flows, short-term borrowings, and debt and equity financing. Our near-term business plan does not contemplate the issuance of equity. We believe, based on the information available at this time, that we have sufficient cash on hand and access to additional sources of liquidity to meet our operational needs for the next twelve months. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our chief market risks are refunding risk, that is the availability of property debt or other cash sources to refund maturing property debt, and repricing risk, that is the possibility of increases in base interest rates and credit risk spreads. We primarily use long-dated, fixed-rate, non-recourse property debt on stabilized properties in order to manage the refunding and repricing risks of short-term borrowings. 
 We use working capital primarily to fund short-term uses. We use derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and do not use them for trading or other speculative purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, on a consolidated basis, we had approximately 81.3 million of variable-rate property-level debt outstanding and 365.1 million of variable-rate construction loans. The impact of rising interest rates in recent history has been mitigated by our use of interest rate caps, which as of September 30, 2024, provided protection for our variable interest rate debt. Our use of interest rate caps may vary from quarter to quarter depending on lender requirements, recycling of interest rate caps between projects, and our view on forecasted interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate an increase or decrease in our variable rate indices of 100 basis points with constant credit risk spreads, would have no material impact on interest expense. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held interest rate caps with 799.4 million notional value. These instruments were acquired for 6.3 million and at September 30, 2024, were valued at 1.7 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 110.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, a portion of which earns interest at variable rates.

 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY S ECURITIES, USE OF PROCEEDS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 Aimco 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 From time to time, Aimco may issue shares of its Common Stock in exchange for OP Units, defined under the Aimco Operating Partnership heading below. Such shares are issued based on an exchange ratio of one share for each OP Unit. Aimco may also issue shares of its Common Stock in exchange for limited partnership interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares of Common Stock were issued in exchange for OP Units in such transactions. Had any such shares been issued, the issuances would have been effected in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 In addition to any issuances pursuant to transactions of the types discussed above, there were no unregistered sales of equity securities made by Aimco during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

(1) On July 28, 2022, Aimco announced that its Board of Directors (the "Board") authorized Aimco to repurchase up to 15 million shares of its outstanding Common Stock. On November 6, 2023, Aimco announced that the Board authorized Aimco to repurchase up to an additional 15 million shares of its outstanding Common Stock, for a total of 30 million shares. Subject to certain blackout restrictions, these repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. These share repurchase authorizations have no expiration date. 
 Aimco Operating Partnership 
 There is no public market for OP Units, and Aimco Operating Partnership has no intention of listing OP Units on any securities exchange. In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership s Partnership Agreement restricts the transferability of OP Units. 
 On November 6, 2024, there were 153,125,096 OP Units and equivalents outstanding (of which 141,269,368 were held by Aimco), that were held by 1,917 unitholders of record. 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 Aimco Operating Partnership did not issue any unregistered OP Units during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Repurchases of Equity Securities 
 Aimco Operating Partnership s Partnership Agreement generally provides that after holding OP Units for one year, limited partners other than Aimco have the right to redeem their OP Units for cash or, at Aimco's election, shares of Aimco Common Stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary antidilution adjustments). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no OP Units were redeemed in exchange for shares of Common Stock and 33,496 OP Units were redeemed in exchange for cash at an aggregate weighted average price per unit of 8.50.

(1) The terms of the Aimco Operating Partnership s Partnership Agreement do not provide for a maximum number of units that may be repurchased, and other than the express terms of its Partnership Agreement, the Aimco Operating Partnership has no publicly announced plans or programs of repurchase. However, for Aimco to repurchase shares of its Common Stock, the Aimco Operating Partnership must make a concurrent repurchase of its OP Units held by Aimco at a price per unit that is equal to the price per share Aimco pays for its Common Stock. 
 Dividend and Distribution Payments 
 As a REIT, Aimco is required to distribute annually to holders of its Common Stock at least 90.0 of its real estate investment trust taxable income, which, as defined by the Code and United States Department of Treasury regulations, is generally equivalent to net taxable ordinary income. Our Board determines and declares Aimco's dividends. In making a dividend determination, our Board considers a variety of factors, including REIT distribution requirements; current market conditions; liquidity needs; and other uses of cash, such as deleveraging and accretive investment activities.
