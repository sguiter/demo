 , which represents all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Devcool (the Acquisition ). The closing of

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic 

COVID-19 has created uncertainty for our employees,
members, and customers. We consider the impact of the pandemic on our business by evaluating the health of our operations, any changes
to our revenue outlook, and the degree to which interest in Company s solutions have evolved during these unprecedented times. We
measure our performance through several key metrics; and as gauged these performance metrics, service levels have been high, and customer
engagement and satisfaction have remained strong through these tough times. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse
impact on our financial condition and results of operations to date, the future impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our operational and
financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers
and our sales cycles, impact on our marketing efforts, and any reduction in spending by our customers, all of which are uncertain and
cannot be predicted. We have a diverse set of customers, while some have faced headwinds, others have experienced growth. Because of COVID-19,
Healthcare and Life Sciences organizations are accelerating research, rethinking patient care, and maintaining clinical and operational
continuity during this unprecedented time for the global health system. COVID-19 has necessitated the adoption of digital communication
channels and remote working technology within the Healthcare and Life Sciences industry at a rapid pace and our proprietary platforms
and solutions addresses these challenges. Our business is focused on providing digital platform solutions to healthcare organizations
and it is our mission to adequately address COVID-19 challenges for the benefit of our customers and society in general. As a result,
consumers have better personal care, convenience, and value. COVID-19 is expected to drive increased utilization of technology during
and after the pandemic, and such shift to a virtual approach creates a unique opportunity for our business to shape the new virtual-oriented
experiences of businesses through our cloud technology and services and our value proposition resonates with a broader audience of companies
as they turn their focus to safely reopening their workplaces and managing the ongoing health and well-being of employees and their families.

The Company s effective tax rate is for
the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and and for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 The future effective income tax rate depends
on various factors, such as the Company s income (loss) before taxes, tax legislation and the geographic composition of pre-tax
income. 

The Company files a consolidated federal tax
return with its parent and records its share of the consolidated federal tax expense on a separate return basis. The Company s
current tax expense is nil . There is no liability in 2023 on account of losses. 

The Company s federal and state income tax
returns are generally subject to possible examination by the taxing authorities until the expiration of the related statute of limitations
on those tax returns which is generally three years from the original filing deadline. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax
assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of
existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company s judgment regarding future profitability may change
due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning
strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Company s income tax provision would increase
or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.

Overview 

Healthcare Triangle, Inc. (the Company is a leading healthcare information technology company focused on advancing innovative, industry-transforming solutions in the areas of
cloud services, data science, professional and managed services for the Healthcare and Life Sciences industry. 

The Company was formed on October 29, 2019, as
a Nevada corporation and then converted into a Delaware corporation on April 24, 2020, to provide IT and data services to the Healthcare
and Life Sciences HCLS industry. The business commenced on January 1, 2020, after the Parent transferred its Life Sciences

30 

Our Business Model 

The majority of our revenue is generated by our
full-time employees who provide software services and Managed Services and Support to our clients in the Healthcare and Life Sciences
industry. Our software services include strategic advisory, implementation and development services and Managed Services and Support include
post implementation support and cloud hosting. 

Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is likely to
continue to have, a severe and unprecedented impact on the world and on our business. Measures to prevent its spread, including government-imposed
restrictions on large gatherings, closures of face-to-face events, shelter in place health orders and travel restrictions
have had a significant effect on certain of our business operations. In response to these business disruptions, which include a transition
to remote working, reducing certain of our discretionary expenditures and eliminating non-essential travel particularly with respect to
COVID-19 impacted operation and complying with health and safety guidelines to protect employees, contractors, and customers. 

There has been no major impact on account of COVID19 during the quarter
ended September 30, 2024. 

The Company has obtained necessary funding to
manage our short-term working capital requirements. The Company has not altered any credit terms with its customers and the realization
from the customers have generally been on time. The Company has been able to service its debt and other obligations on time. There has
been no material impact on the operational liquidity and capital resources on account of COVID-19. 

Key Factors of Success 

We believe that our future growth, success, and
performance are dependent on many factors, including those mentioned below. While these factors present significant opportunities for
us, they also represent the challenges that we must successfully address in order to grow our business and improve our results of operations. 

Investment in scaling the business 

We need to continuously invest in sales, and marketing
to promote our solutions to new and existing customers in various geographies, and other operational and administrative functions in systems,
controls and governance to support our expected growth and our transition to a public company. We anticipate that our employee strength
will increase because of these investments. 

Adoption of our solutions by new and existing customers 

We believe that our ability to increase our customer
base will enable us to drive growth. Most of our customers initially deploy our solutions within a division or geography and may only
initially deploy a limited set of our available solutions. Our future growth is dependent upon our existing customers continued
success and renewals of our solutions agreements, deployment of our solutions to additional divisions or geographies and the purchase
of subscriptions to additional solutions. Our growth is also dependent on the adoption of our solutions by new customers. Our customers
are large organizations who typically have long procurement cycles which may lead to declines in the pace of our new customer additions. 

Subscription services adoption 

The key factor to our success in generating substantial
recurring subscription revenues in future will be our ability to successfully market and persuade new customers to adopt our SaaS offerings.
We are in the early stages of marketing our SaaS offerings such as DataEz, CloudEz and Readabl.AI, and do not yet have enough information
about our competition or customer acceptance to determine whether or not recurring subscription revenue from these offerings will have
a material impact on our revenue growth. 

Mix of solutions and software services revenues 

Another factor to our success is the ability to
sell our solutions to the existing software services customers. During the initial period of deployment by a customer, we generally provide
a greater number of services including advisory, implementation and training. At the same time, many of our customers have historically
purchased our solutions after the deployment. Hence, the proportion of total revenues for a customer associated with software services
is relatively high during the initial deployment period. While our software services help our customers achieve measurable improvements
and make them stickier, they have lower gross margins than solution-based revenue. Over time, we expect the revenues to shift towards
recurring and subscription-based revenues. 

31 

Components of Results of Operations 

Revenues 

We provide our services and manage our business under these operating
segments: 

Software Services 

Managed Services and Support 

Platform Services 

Software Services 

The Company earns revenue primarily through the
sale of software services that is generated from providing strategic advisory, implementation, and development services. The Company enters
into Statement of Work (SOW) which provides for service obligations that need to be fulfilled as agreed with the customer. The majority
of our software services arrangements are billed on a time and materials basis and revenues are recognized over time based on time incurred
and contractually agreed upon rates. Certain software services revenues are billed on a fixed fee basis and revenues are typically recognized
over time as the services are delivered based on time incurred and customer acceptance. We recognize revenue when we have the right to
invoice the customer using the allowable practical expedient under ASC 606-10-55-18 since the right to invoice the customer corresponds
with the performance obligations completed. 

Managed Services and Support 

Managed Services and Support include post implementation
support and cloud hosting. Managed Services and Support are a distinct performance obligation. Revenue for Managed Services and Support
is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. 

Platform Services 

Platform Services from CloudEz, DataEz are offered both as a
solution delivery model and as Software as a Service (SaaS) on a subscription model. readbl.ai is offered only as Software as a
Service (SaaS) on a subscription model. 

The revenue from solutions delivery model contains
a series of separately identifiable and distinct services that represent performance obligations that are satisfied over time. During
the periods presented the company generated Platform revenue on SaaS, which is recurring revenue. 

Our SaaS agreements are generally non-cancellable
during the term, although customers typically will have the right to terminate their agreements for cause in the event of material breach. 

SaaS revenues will be recognized ratably over
the respective non-cancellable subscription term because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. Our subscription arrangements
will be considered service contracts, and the customer will not have the right to take possession of the software Segment wise revenue
breakup. 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue consists primarily of employee-related
costs associated with the rendering of our services, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, the cost of subcontractors,
travel costs, cloud hosting charges and allocated overhead the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage
of the related revenues than for our subscription services due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. Our business and
operational models are designed to be highly scalable and leverage variable costs to support revenue-generating activities. 

While we may grow our headcount overtime to capitalize
on our market opportunities, we believe our increased investment in automation, electronic health record integration capabilities, and
economies of scale in our operating model, will position us to grow our platform solutions revenue at a greater rate than our cost of
revenue. 

32 

Operating Expenses 

Research and Development 

Research and development expense (majorly our
investment in innovation) consists primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, incentives, employment taxes,
severance, and equity compensation costs for our software developers, engineers, analysts, project managers, and other employees engaged
in the development and enhancement of our cloud-based platform applications. Research and development expenses also include certain third-party
consulting fees. Our research and development expense excludes any depreciation and amortization. 

We expect to continue our focus on developing
new product offerings and enhancing our existing product offerings. As a result, we expect our research and development expense to increase
in absolute dollars, although it may vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales and marketing expense consists primarily
of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, commissions, travel, discretionary incentive compensation, employment taxes,
severance, and equity compensation costs for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, business development, and marketing. Sales
and marketing expense also includes operating expenses for marketing programs, research, trade shows, and brand messages, and public relations
costs. 

We expect our sales and marketing expenses to
continue to increase in absolute dollar terms as we strategically invest to expand our business, although it may vary from period to period
as a percentage of total revenues. 

General and Administrative 

Our general and administrative expenses consist
primarily of employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits, discretionary incentive compensation, employment taxes, severance,
and stock-based compensation expenses, for employees who are responsible for management information systems, administration, human resources,
finance, legal, and executive management. The general and administrative expenses also include occupancy expenses (including rent, utilities,
and facilities maintenance), professional fees, consulting fees, insurance, travel, contingent consideration, transaction costs, integration
costs, and other expenses. Our general and administrative expenses exclude depreciation and amortization. 

In the nearest future, we expect our general and
administrative expenses to continue to increase to support business growth. Over the long term, we expect general and administrative expenses
to decrease as a percentage of revenue. 

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 

Our depreciation and amortization expense consists
primarily of depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of Customer relationship and capitalized software development costs, and amortization
of intangible assets. We expect our depreciation and amortization expense to increase as we expand our business organically and through
acquisitions. 

Other Income (Expense), Net 

Other income (expense), net consists of finance cost and gains or losses
on foreign currency. 

Deferred revenues 

Advanced billings to clients in excess of revenue earned are recorded
as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met. 

Unbilled accounts receivable 

Unbilled accounts receivable is a contract asset
related to the delivery of our professional services for which the related billings will occur in a future period. Unbilled receivables
are classified as accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet. Although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments
regarding revenue recognition is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that
could be material. 

33 

Provision for Income Taxes 

Provision for income taxes consists of federal
and state income taxes in the United States, including deferred income taxes reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

Factors affecting revenues of Software Services,
Managed Services and Support and Platform Services 

Our strategy is to achieve meaningful long-term
revenue growth through sales of Managed Services and Support and Platform Services to existing and new clients within our target market.
In order to increase our cross-selling opportunity between our operating segments and realize long time revenue growth, our focus has
shifted more towards Managed Services and Support and Platform Services which is of recurring nature when compared to Software Services
segment which is of non-recurring nature. This also helps in retaining existing customers by leveraging our Managed Services and Support
and Platform Services as a growth agent. This renewed focus on driving demand for subscription and platform-based model will help us in
expanding our customer base and enhance customer retention which is a challenge for our existing Software Services segment. Software Services
contracts are driven by Time and Material and on-site employees delivering services at customers location.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 

The current ratio measures a company s ability
to pay off its current liabilities (payable within one year) with its total current assets such as cash, accounts receivable, and inventories.
The higher the ratio, the better the company s liquidity position. A good current ratio is between 1.2 to 2, which means that a
business has 2 times more current assets than liabilities to covers its debts. The Company s current ratio, based on the three months
ended September 30, 2024, financial statement is 0.3 compared to 0.7 for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. 

The Company s current debt equity ratio,
based on the three months ended September 30, 2024, financial statement is -1.33, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to
8.99 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. A debt-to-equity ratio below 1 means that a company has lower exposure to debts than equity. 

The Company does not have inventory and hence
the quick ratio is the same as current ratio. 

Sources of Liquidity 

As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources
of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 0.03 million. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30,
2024, and the future operating cash flows of the entity will provide adequate resources to fund ongoing cash requirements. If sources
of liquidity are not available or if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations during the next twelve months, we may be
required to obtain additional sources of funds through additional operational improvements, capital market transactions, asset sales or
financing from third parties, a combination thereof or otherwise. We cannot provide assurance that these additional sources of funds will
be available or, if available, would have reasonable terms.

We have financed our operations primarily through
financing activity and operating cash flows. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments generated from
operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital over the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many
factors including our growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the expansion of sales and marketing activities and the ongoing investments
in platform development.
