FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). All statements other than statements of present and historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report, including without limitation, statements regarding the anticipated benefits of and costs associated with the Transactions (as defined below); our expectations surrounding the Transactions and our ability to grow our business and bolster our financial position; our expected contractual obligations and capital expenditures; our future results of operations and financial position; our expectations regarding strategic transactions, including the Endeavor Asset Acquisition; our expectations regarding actions under our capital return program, including the amount and frequency of share repurchases and dividends; industry and business trends; the impact of market conditions and other macroeconomic factors on our business, financial condition and results of operations; our future business strategy, plans, market growth and our objectives for future operations; and our competitive market position within our industry are forward-looking statements. 
 Without limiting the foregoing, you can generally identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms aim, "anticipate," "believe," "could," mission, "may," "will," "should," "expect," "intend," "plan," "estimate," "project," "predict," "potential," target, "contemplate," or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology and expressions. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are only predictions and are based on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including but not limited to: 
 difficulties with the integration and in realizing the expected benefits of the Transactions, including the business combination; 

the unfavorable outcome of legal proceedings that may be instituted against TKO Group Holdings, UFC, WWE and their affiliates in connection with the Transactions, including the business combination; 

the inability to capture all or part of the anticipated cost and revenue synergies; 

potential liabilities that are not known, probable or estimable at this time; 

the inability to maintain the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE; 

the risk of adverse tax consequences of the Merger and the Conversion; 

the inability to retain WWE or UFC management, employees and/or talent; 

the impact of future domestic and international industry trends on our business and our future growth, business strategy and objectives for future operations; 

the inability to renew or replace our distribution rights agreements on equal or more favorable terms; 

the possibility we may be adversely affected by other economic, business and/or competitive factors; and 

other important factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ), as updated by Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this Quarterly Report and Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Quarterly Report and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those implied by forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. Even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we reference herein completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by applicable law, we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.

controlling non-economic voting interest in TKO on a fully-diluted basis and (2) a economic interest on a fully-diluted basis in the operating subsidiary, TKO OpCo, which owns all of the assets of the UFC and WWE businesses after the closing of the Transactions, and (B) the stockholders of WWE received (1) a voting interest in TKO on a fully-diluted basis and (2) a economic interest in TKO, which in turn holds a economic interest in TKO OpCo on a fully-diluted basis. WWE is an integrated media and entertainment company that has been involved in the sports entertainment business for four decades. WWE is principally engaged in the production and distribution of unique and creative content through various channels, including content rights agreements for its flagship programs, Raw , SmackDown and NXT , premium live event programming, monetization across social media outlets, live events, and licensing of various WWE-themed products. The Transactions have been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of WWE using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the guidance of ASC 805, Business Combinations ASC 805 ), with TKO OpCo, the legal acquiree, treated as the accounting acquirer. Based on this determination, the Company has allocated the purchase price to the fair value of WWE s identifiable assets and liabilities as of the Closing Date, with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. The goodwill was assigned entirely to the WWE segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. The weighted average life of finite-lived intangible assets acquired was years, which consisted of trademarks and trade names with a weighted average life of years, customer relationships with a weighted average life of years and other intangible assets with a weighted average life of years. In connection with the Transactions, the Company incurred transaction costs of million and million, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Consideration Transferred The fair value of the consideration transferred in the reverse acquisition was million, which consisted of shares of TKO Class A common stock valued at million, Replacement Awards (as defined below) valued at million and million of deferred consideration which was paid on September 29, 2023 to former WWE shareholders in the form of a special dividend. Pursuant to the Transactions, awards of WWE RSUs and PSUs outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Transactions were converted into awards of TKO RSUs or PSUs, as applicable, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to the Closing Date (the Replacement Awards ). The portion of the fair-value-based measure of the Replacement Awards that is attributable to pre-combination vesting is purchase consideration and is valued at approximately million. Allocation of Purchase Price The purchase price is allocated to the underlying WWE assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the Closing Date, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the synergies that are expected to arise as a result of the Transactions and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The purchase price allocation reflects fair value estimates, including measurement period adjustments, based on management analysis, including work performed by third-party valuation specialists. The effects of measurement period adjustments made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Equity Method Investments In July 2024, the Company paid million in exchange for an approximately ownership stake in EverPass, LLC, which owns a live sports media platform that assists in distributing live sports and entertainment content to bars, restaurants, hotels and other commercial venues. The Company also made an additional pro rata capital contribution of million in September 2024. The Company has accounted for this investment using the equity method of accounting and will recognize its proportionate share of income or loss in future periods. The Company recognized equity earnings of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and equity earnings of million and equity losses of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, from our other equity method investments. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company received distributions of million and million from these equity method investments . Nonmarketable Equity Investments Without Readily Determinable Fair Values As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held various investments in nonmarketable equity instruments of private companies. The Company did t record any impairment charges on these investments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . In addition, there were observable price change events that were completed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The fair value measurements of the Company s equity investments and nonmarketable equity investments without readily determinable fair values are classified within Level 3 as significant unobservable inputs are used as part of the determination of fair value. Significant unobservable inputs may include variables such as near-term prospects of the investees, recent financing activities of the investees, and the investees' capital structure, as well as other economic variables, which reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing these assets. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values, the Company has elected to use the measurement alternative to fair value that will allow these investments to be recorded at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for subsequent observable price changes.

The Credit Facilities are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of Zuffa Guarantor, LLC, UFC Holdings, LLC and certain subsidiaries thereof. In May 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement, which extended the Revolving Credit Facility s maturity by twelve months to October 29, 2025. Payments under the First Lien Term Loan include principal amortization that is payable in equal quarterly installments, with any remaining balance payable on the final maturity date of April 29, 2026. In June 2023, the Company amended the terms of the First Lien Term Loan to replace the adjusted LIBOR reference rate with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and provide for a credit spread adjustment (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The First Lien Term Loan accrues interest at an annual interest rate of adjusted SOFR plus - , which totaled a s of September 30, 2024.

The Company is only required to meet the First Lien Leverage Ratio if the sum of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility plus outstanding letters of credit exceeding million that are not cash collateralized exceeds percent of the capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility as measured on a quarterly basis, as defined in the Credit Agreement. This covenant did not apply as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , as the Company had borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company had million of outstanding letters of credit as of September 30, 2024 , and outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2023. The Credit Facilities restrict the ability of certain subsidiaries of the Company to make distributions and other payments to the Company. These restrictions include exceptions for, among other things, (1) amounts necessary to make tax payments, (2) a limited annual amount for employee equity repurchases, (3) distributions required to fund certain parent entities, (4) other specific allowable situations and (5) a general restricted payment basket, which generally provides for no restrictions as long as the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than x. The estimated fair values of the Company s First Lien Term Loan are based on quoted market values for the debt. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the face amount of the Company s First Lien Term Loan approximates its fair value.

Changes in the ownership interest in TKO OpCo while the Company retains its controlling interest in TKO OpCo will be accounted for as equity transactions. As such, future redemptions or direct exchanges of Common Units in TKO OpCo by the other members of TKO OpCo will result in a change in ownership and reduce the amount recorded as non-controlling interest and increase additional paid-in capital.

billion and deferred tax liabilities in the amount of million, all of which was recorded through goodwill as of the Closing Date. In accordance with ASC 740, each interim period is considered integral to the annual period and tax expense is generally determined using an estimate of the annual effective income tax rate ("AETR"). The Company records income tax expense each quarter using the estimated AETR to provide for income taxes on a current year-to-date basis, adjusted for discrete items that are noted in the relevant period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company treated the legal settlement related to UFC antitrust lawsuits of million and million, respectively, as described in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies , discretely. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes in interim periods, the Company computed its income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, adjusted for discrete items as noted. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 202 3 was mill ion and million, respectively, based on pretax inco me of million and million, respectively.

million and million, respectively, based on pretax loss of m illion and pretax income of million, respectively. T he effective tax rate was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from tax expense in the same period in 2023 primarily due to the new corporate structure as a result of the Transactions and the legal settlement related to UFC antitrust lawsuits of million and million, respectively, that resulted in the recognition of discrete tax benefits of million and mi llion, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Any tax balances reflected on the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 will be adjusted accordingly to reflect the actual financial results for the year ending December 31, 2024. The Company s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes, non-controlling interest, withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions that are not based on net income, and increased income subject to tax in foreign jurisdictions which differ from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had unrecognized tax bene fits of m illion and million, respectively, for which the Company is unable to make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities. The Company records valuation allowances against its net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered based on all available positive and negative evidence, including historical results, reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of operations. Other Matters On August 16, 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("IRA"). The IRA, in addition to other provisions, creates a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax ("CAMT") on adjusted financial statement income for applicable corporations. The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company was not subject to CAMT. The Company will continue to assess the potential tax effects of the CAMT on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In December 2022, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") proposed Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules, which provides for changes to numerous long-standing tax principles including the adoption of a global minimum tax rate of 15 for multinational enterprises ("GloBE rules"). Various jurisdictions have adopted or are in the process of enacting legislation to adopt GloBE rules and other countries are expected to adopt GloBE rules in the future. While changes in tax laws in the various countries in which the Company operates can negatively impact the Company s results of operations and financial position in future periods, the Company s impact related to the adoption of the GloBE rules, effective January 1, 2024, was not material to the Company s consolidated financial position.

related class-action lawsuits were filed against Zuffa between December 2014 and March 2015 by a total of former UFC fighters. The lawsuits, which were substantially identical, were transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Nevada and consolidated into a single action in June 2015, captioned Le et al. v. Zuffa, LLC , No. 2:15-cv-1045-RFB-BNW (D. Nev.) (the Le case). The lawsuit alleged that Zuffa violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by monopsonizing an alleged market for the services of elite professional MMA athletes. The fighter plaintiffs claimed that Zuffa s alleged conduct injured them by artificially depressing the compensation they received for their services, and they sought treble damages under the antitrust laws, as well as attorneys fees and costs, and, in some instances, injunctive relief. On August 9, 2023, the district court certified the lawsuit as a damages class action, encompassing the period from December 16, 2010 to June 30, 2017. The fighter plaintiffs in the Le case abandoned their claim for injunctive relief, so the only relief the fighter plaintiffs would have sought at trial was damages. On June 24, 2021, another lawsuit, Johnson et al. v. Zuffa, LLC et al. , No. 2:21-cv-1189-RFB-BNW (D. Nev.) (the Johnson case), was filed by a putative class of former UFC fighters and covering the period from July 1, 2017 to the present and alleged substantially similar claims to the Le case and sought injunctive relief. On March 13, 2024, TKO OpCo, and certain of its affiliates, including Endeavor, reached an agreement to settle all claims asserted in both class action lawsuits (Le and Johnson) for an aggregate amount of million payable by the Company and its subsidiaries, which was submitted to the court for preliminary approval. On July 30, 2024, following the court s hearings on plaintiffs submission to approve the settlement, the court issued an order denying the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agr eement. On September 26, 2024, following the court's denial of an earlier proposed settlement agreement, the Company reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle all claims asserted in the Le case for an aggregate amount of million payable in installments over an agreed-upon period of time by the Company and its subsidiaries (the Updated Settlement Agreement ). The term s of the Updated Settlement Agreement have been memorialized in a long form agreement, which was preliminarily approved by the court on October 22, 2024. In connection with these proposed settlement agreements, the Company recorded charges of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company paid million of the aggregate million settlement amount into escrow in late October 2024 shortly following receipt of preliminary approval in accordance with the terms of the Updated Settlement Agreement. The Company expects to make two payments covering the remaining million in 2025. The Company anticipates that the settlement amount will be deductible for tax purposes. A motion to dismiss Endeavor from the Johnson action remains pending and no trial date has been set.

Corporate expenses also include service fees paid by the Company to Endeavor related to certain corporate activities as well as certain revenue generating activities under the Services Agreement. All prior period amounts related to the segment change have been retrospectively reclassified to conform to the new presentation.

The change was primarily due to the change in the amount of reported net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the reported net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as well as the effect of the Transactions. 
 Segment Results of Operations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we classified our business into two reportable segments: UFC and WWE. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our segments based on segment Revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes segment Adjusted EBITDA is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability, and Adjusted EBITDA is used to evaluate the operating performance of our segments and for planning and forecasting purposes, including the allocation of resources and capital. Segment operating results reflect earnings before corporate expenses. These segment results of operations should be read in conjunction with our discussion of the Company s consolidated results of operations included above. 
 The following tables set forth Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for each of our segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Corporate 
 Corporate expenses relate largely to corporate activities, including information technology, facilities, legal, human resources, finance, accounting, treasury, investor relations, corporate communications, community relations and compensation to TKO s management and board of directors, which support both reportable segments. Corporate expenses also include service fees paid by the Company to Endeavor related to corporate activities as well as revenue generating activities under the Services Agreement.

(48.9) 

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 40.3 million, or 196 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The acquisition of WWE contributed incremental corporate expenses of 11.9 million, primarily driven by the cost of personnel and other general and administrative expenses. The remaining decrease was attributable to 20.2 million resulting from increases in cost of personnel, including TKO executive compensation, and other public company expenses following the Transactions, as well as 8.2 million of higher services fees paid to Endeavor. The costs associated with WWE's portion of the service fees did not commence until March 2024. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 127.4 million, or 261 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The acquisition of WWE contributed incremental corporate expenses of 52.3 million, primarily driven by the cost of personnel and other general and administrative expenses. The remaining decrease was attributable to 54.2 million resulting from increases in cost of personnel, including TKO executive compensation, and other public company expenses following the Transactions, as well as 20.9 million of higher service fees paid to Endeavor. The costs associated with WWE's portion of the service fees did not commence until March 2024. 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income, excluding income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, merger and acquisition costs, certain legal costs, restructuring, severance and impairment charges, and certain other items when applicable. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue. 
 TKO management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful to investors as these measures eliminate the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from its capital investments and intangible assets, and improve comparability by eliminating the significant level of interest expense associated with TKO s debt facilities, as well as income taxes which may not be comparable with other companies based on TKO s tax and corporate structure. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are used as the primary bases to evaluate TKO s consolidated operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of TKO s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on TKO s debt; 

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; and 

they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in TKO s statements of cash flows. 

TKO management compensates for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin along with other comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of TKO s operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered substitutes for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income as indicators of TKO s financial performance, as measures of discretionary cash available to it to invest in the growth of its business or as measures of cash that will be 
 39 

Table of Contents 

available to TKO to meet its obligations. Although TKO uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as financial measures to assess the performance of its business, such use is limited because it does not include certain material costs necessary to operate TKO s business. TKO s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as indications that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. These non-GAAP financial measures, as determined and presented by TKO, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Set forth below are reconciliations of TKO s most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to these non-GAAP financial measures on a consolidated basis.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, equity-based compensation includes 1.0 million and 16.7 million of expense, respectively, associated with certain services provided by an independent contractor in the WWE segment. Equity-based compensation also includes 3.3 million of expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 16.5 million of expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 associated with accelerated vesting of the Replacement Awards related to the workforce reduction of certain employees in the WWE segment and Corporate. 

(2) Includes (i) certain costs of professional fees and bonuses related to the Transactions and payable contingent on the closing of the Transactions and (ii) certain costs of professional advisors related to other strategic transactions, primarily the Endeavor Asset Acquisition. 

(3) Includes costs related to certain litigation matters including antitrust lawsuits for UFC and WWE and matters where Mr. McMahon has agreed to make future payments to certain counterparties personally. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, these costs include settlement charges of 40.0 million and 375.0 million, respectively, regarding the UFC antitrust lawsuits, as described in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 

(4) Includes costs resulting from the Company s cost reduction program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as described in Note 16, Restructuring Charges , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded impairment charges of 1.5 million and 25.8 million as a result of reducing the carrying value of WWE assets held for sale to their fair value less cost to sell, as described in Note 6, Supplementary Data , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Cash flows from operations are used to fund TKO s day-to-day operations, revenue-generating activities, and routine capital expenditures, as well as to service its long-term debt, and are expected to be used to fund our capital return programs. 
 Credit Facilities 
 As of September 30, 2024, there is currently outstanding an aggregate of 2.7 billion of first lien term loans under a credit agreement dated August 18, 2016 (as amended and/or restated, the Credit Agreement ), by and among Zuffa Guarantor, LLC, UFC Holdings, LLC, as borrower, the lenders party hereto and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as Administrative Agent, which was entered into in connection with the acquisition of Zuffa by EGH in 2016. The facilities under the Credit Agreement consist of (i) a first lien secured term loan (the First Lien Term Loan and (ii) a secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 205.0 million, letters of credit in an aggregate face amount not in excess of 40.0 million and swingline loans in an aggregate principal amount not in excess of 15.0 million (collectively, the Revolving Credit Facility , and, together with the First Lien Term Loan, the Credit 
 40 

Table of Contents 

Facilities ). The Credit Facilities are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of Zuffa Guarantor, LLC, UFC Holdings, LLC and certain subsidiaries thereof. 
 Following a repricing under the Credit Facilities in January 2021, term loan borrowings under the Credit Facilities bore interest at a variable interest rate equal to either, at its option, adjusted LIBOR or the ABR plus, in each case, an applicable margin. LIBOR term loans accrue interest at a rate equal to an adjusted LIBOR plus 2.75 -3.00 , depending on the First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), in each case with a LIBOR floor of 0.75 . ABR term loans accrue interest at a rate equal to (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5 , (b) the prime rate, (c) adjusted LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00 and (d) 1.75 , plus (ii) 1.75 -2.00 . In June 2023, the parties amended the terms of the First Lien Term Loan to replace the adjusted LIBOR reference rate with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The term loans under the Credit Facilities include 1 principal amortization payable in equal quarterly installments and mature on April 29, 2026. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had the option to borrow incremental term loans in an aggregate amount equal to at least 455.0 million, subject to market demand, and may be able to borrow additional funds depending on its First Lien Leverage Ratio. The Credit Agreement includes certain mandatory prepayment provisions relating to, among other things, the incurrence of additional debt. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility has 205.0 million of total borrowing capacity and letter of credit and swingline loan sub-limits of up to 40.0 million and 15.0 million, respectively. Revolving loan borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate equal to either, at TKO s option, adjusted LIBOR or ABR plus, in each case, an applicable margin. LIBOR revolving loans accrue interest at a rate equal to an adjusted LIBOR plus 3.50-4.00 , depending on the First Lien Leverage Ratio, in each case with a LIBOR floor of 0.00 . ABR revolving loans accrue interest at a rate equal to (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50 , (b) the prime rate, (c) adjusted LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.00 and (d) 1.00 , plus (ii) 2.50-3.00 , depending on the First Lien Leverage Ratio. In April 2023, the parties amended the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility to replace adjusted LIBOR reference rate used for the facility with SOFR plus 2.75-3.00 . The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.25-0.50 , based on the First Lien Leverage Ratio and letter of credit fees of 0.125 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and 10.0 million outstanding letters of credit. In April 2024, the Company borrowed 150.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund certain share repurchases that occurred during the second quarter of 2024. In June 2024, the Company fully repaid the 150.0 million outstanding. In May 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement, which extended the Revolving Credit Facility s maturity by twelve months to October 29, 2025. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a financial covenant if greater than 35 of the borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding cash collateralized letters of credit and non-cash collateralized letters of credit of up to 10.0 million) is utilized at the end of any fiscal quarter. This covenant was not applicable on September 30, 2024, as the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants around indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, guarantees, investments, asset sales and transactions with affiliates. 
 The borrower s obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain of TKO OpCo s indirect wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. 
 The Credit Agreement contains specified restrictions on the ability to make distributions and other payments. These restrictions on dividends include exceptions for, among other things, (1) amounts necessary to make tax payments, (2) a limited annual amount for employee equity repurchases, (3) distributions required to fund certain parent entities, (4) other specific allowable situations and (5) a general restricted payment basket, which generally provides for no restrictions as long as the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than 5.0x. 
 Other Debt 
 In October 2018, UFC entered into a 28.0 million Loan Agreement and a 12.0 million Loan Agreement in order to finance the purchase of a building and its adjacent land (the Secured Commercial Loans ). The Secured Commercial Loans have identical terms except the 28.0 million Loan Agreement is secured by a deed of trust for UFC s headquarters building and underlying land in Las Vegas and the 12.0 million Loan Agreement is secured by a deed of trust for the acquired building and its adjacent land, also located in Las Vegas. The Secured Commercial Loans bore interest at a rate of LIBOR + 1.62 (with a LIBOR floor of 0.88 ). In May 2023, the parties amended the terms of the Secured Commercial Loans to replace the adjusted LIBOR reference rate with SOFR, and bear interest at a rate of SOFR plus 1.70 . Principal amortization of 4 is payable in monthly installments with any remaining balance payable on the final maturity date of November 1, 2028. 
 41 

Table of Contents 

The applicable loan agreements each contain a financial covenant that requires UFC to maintain a Debt Service Coverage Ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreements of no more than 1.15-to-1 as measured on an annual basis (the Secured Commercial Loan Covenant ). As of September 30, 2024, UFC was in compliance with the Secured Commercial Loan Covenant. 
 Capital Return Programs 
 On October 24, 2024, the Company announced that its board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to 2.0 billion of its Class A common stock and the approval of a quarterly cash dividend program pursuant to which holders of TKO s Class A common stock will receive their pro rata share of 75.0 million expected quarterly distributions to be made by TKO OpCo. 
 TKO will determine at its discretion the timing and the amount of any repurchases based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price, and other factors. Repurchases under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, and TKO is not obligated to acquire any particular amount under the share repurchase program. The share repurchase program has no expiration, is expected to be completed within approximately three to four years and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. 
 TKO s dividend will be paid quarterly to holders of TKO s Class A common stock. TKO intends to begin making quarterly cash dividend payments on March 31, 2025. Future declarations of quarterly dividends are subject to the determination and discretion of TKO based on its consideration of various factors, such as its results of operations, financial condition, market conditions, earnings, cash flow requirements, restrictions in its debt agreements and legal requirements and other factors that TKO deems relevant.

Operating activities increased from 247.7 million of cash provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 526.6 million of cash provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 344.3 million driven by the 375.0 million charge under the settlement agreement in the UFC antitrust lawsuits and the timing of bonus payments, partially offset by a decrease in net income for the period of 232.9 million, which included certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of 247.2 million and equity-based compensation of 38.5 million. 
 Investing activities decreased from 47.6 million of cash provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 65.1 million of cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects payments for property, buildings and equipment of 54.6 million and investments in affiliates of 21.5 million, partially offset by infrastructure improvement incentives received of 11.0 million. Cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects 381.2 million of cash acquired from WWE as part of the Transactions, partially offset by the payment of 321.0 million of deferred compensation in the form of a divided to former WWE shareholders and payments for property, buildings and equipment of 12.6 million. 
 Financing activities increased from 285.3 million of cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 239.6 million of cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects share repurchases of 165.0 million, distributions to Endeavor and its subsidiaries of 41.8 million and net payments on debt of 33.5 million. Cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects distributions to Endeavor and subsidiaries of 260.5 million and net payments on debt of 24.5 million. 
 Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 TKO s sources of liquidity are (1) cash on hand, (2) cash flows from operations and (3) available borrowings under the Credit Facilities (which borrowings would be subject to certain restrictive covenants contained therein). Based on its current expectations, TKO believes that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund its working capital requirements and to meet its commitments, including long-term debt service, for at least the next 12 months. 
 TKO expects that its primary liquidity needs will be cash to (1) provide capital to facilitate organic growth of its business, (2) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to its employees, athletes and talent, (3) fund capital expenditures and investments, (4) pay interest and principal when due on the Credit Facilities, (5) pay income taxes, (6) reduce its outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facilities, (7) fund the legal settlements described in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report, (8) fund share repurchases as authorized by the Board and (9) make distributions 
 42 

Table of Contents 

to members and, in accordance with the Company s cash management policy, to TKO stockholders, including the planned quarterly dividend when declared by the Board. 
 TKO expects to refinance the Credit Facilities prior to the maturity of the outstanding loans in 2026. It currently anticipates being able to secure funding for such refinancing at favorable terms; however, its ability to do so may be impacted by many factors, including TKO s growth and other factors specific to its business as well as macro-economic factors beyond its control. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 3, Recent Accounting Pronouncements , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for further information on certain accounting standards that have been recently adopted or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 For a description of our policies regarding our critical accounting estimates, see Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Annual Report. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates or the application or the results of the application of those policies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements from those previously disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Item 3. Quantitative a nd Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 TKO is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact TKO s financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the floating interest component on our long-term debt. The Credit Facilities bear interest at floating rates and we regularly monitor and manage interest rate risks. Holding debt levels constant as of September 30, 2024, a 1 increase in the effective interest rates would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately 27 million. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We have operations in several countries outside of the United States, and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies, principally the British Pound and the Brazilian Real. The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. These changes could adversely affect the U.S. dollar equivalent of TKO s non-U.S. dollar revenue and operating costs and expenses and reduce international demand for its content and services, all of which could negatively affect TKO s business, financial condition and results of operations in a given period or in specific territories. 
 Holding other variables constant (such as interest rates and debt levels), if the U.S. dollar appreciated by 10 against the foreign currencies used by TKO s operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues would have decreased by approximately 5.1 million and operating income would have decreased by approximately 0.3 million. 
 We regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures. TKO does not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes. 
 Credit Risk 
 TKO maintains its cash and cash equivalents with various major banks and other high quality financial institutions, and its deposits at these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions and the failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents or any inability to access or delays in our ability to access our funds could adversely affect our business and financial position. 
 Item 4. C ontrols and Procedures 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PA RT II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 It em 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be involved in claims and proceedings arising in the course of our business. The outcome of any such claims or proceedings, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. For a description of our legal proceedings, refer to Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies , to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 1A. R isk Factors 
 Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described as risk factors, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual operating results and financial condition to vary materially from past, or anticipated future, operating results and financial condition. For a discussion of these potential risks and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and the price of our common stock. Other than the risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors to those included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 We may fail to complete the Endeavor Asset Acquisition if certain required conditions, many of which are outside our control, are not satisfied. 
 The completion of the Endeavor Asset Acquisition is subject to various customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) the absence of any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, ruling, stipulation, directive, assessment, subpoena, verdict, determination or award issued, promulgated or entered, by or with any governmental entity that has the effect of making the Endeavor Asset Acquisition illegal or otherwise restraining or prohibiting the consummation of the Endeavor Asset Acquisition, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties and (iii) compliance in all material respects by each party with its obligations under the transaction agreement. Despite the parties best efforts, we may not be able to satisfy or receive the various closing conditions and obtain the necessary approvals in a timely fashion or at all. 
 We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Endeavor Asset Acquisition and may assume unanticipated liabilities. 
 The success of the Endeavor Asset Acquisition will depend on, among other things, our ability to integrate the transferred businesses in a manner that realizes the various benefits, growth opportunities and synergies that we have identified. Our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Endeavor Asset Acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. 
 Failure to complete the Endeavor Asset Acquisition could negatively impact our stock price, future business and financial results. 
 If the Endeavor Asset Acquisition is not completed, we will be subject to several risks, including the following: 
 payment for certain costs relating to the Endeavor Asset Acquisition, whether or not the Endeavor Asset Acquisition is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees; 

negative reactions from the financial markets, including potential declines in the price of our Class A common stock due to the fact that current prices may reflect a market assumption that the Endeavor Asset Acquisition will be completed; 

diverted attention of our management to the Endeavor Asset Acquisition rather than to our operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; and 

44 

Table of Contents 

negative impact on our future growth plan, including with regard to potential acquisitions for which we may otherwise have been able to provide a stronger foundation. 

The planned issuance of Class B common stock to the EDR Parties will dilute the percentage ownership interests of our other stockholders. 
 If the Endeavor Asset Acquisition is completed, the Company expects to issue approximately 26.1 million shares of Class B common stock to the EDR Parties, who currently beneficially hold approximately 53.4 of the Company s total outstanding shares of common stock. The issuance of Class B common stock to the EDR Parties will cause a reduction in the relative percentage interest of the Company s other current stockholders in the Company s earnings, if any, voting power, and market capitalization. The issuance will result in (i) an approximate 6 reduction of equity ownership and (ii) an approximate 6 reduction in the total voting power of the Company s Class A common stock. 
 We cannot guarantee we will conduct share repurchases or pay dividends in any specified amounts or particular frequency. 
 On October 24, 2024, we announced that our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to 2.0 billion of our Class A common stock. We will determine at our discretion the timing and the amount of any repurchases under the share repurchase program based on our evaluation of market conditions, share price, and other factors. Repurchases under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The program has no expiration date and we are not obligated to acquire any particular number or dollar value of shares thereunder. While we expect the share repurchase program to be completed within approximately three to four years, the program may not be fully implemented in that timeframe or at all. In addition, the program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under this authorization could affect our stock price and increase its volatility, and the existence of this authorization could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such authorization and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. 
 In addition, on October 24, 2024, we announced that our board of directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend program pursuant to which holders of our Class A common stock will receive their pro rata share of 75.0 million quarterly distributions to be made by TKO OpCo. We currently intend to begin making quarterly cash dividend payments on March 31, 2025, subject to satisfying applicable legal and contractual requirements. Future declarations of quarterly dividends are subject to our determination and discretion based on our consideration of various factors, such as our results of operations, financial condition, market conditions, earnings, cash flow requirements, restrictions in our debt agreements and legal requirements and other factors that we deems relevant. Our board may, at its discretion, decrease or entirely discontinue the dividend program at any time. We cannot provide any assurances that any such regular dividends will be paid in any specified amount or at any particular frequency, if at all.
