These forward-looking statements and other information are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by us using information currently available. The words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, will, should and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or using other similar expressions. In accordance with the provisions of the Litigation Reform Act, we are making investors aware that such forward-looking statements, because they relate to future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Report on Form 10-Q.

Certain important factors affecting the forward-looking statements made herein also include, but are not limited to (i) continued downward pricing pressures in our targeted markets, (ii) the continued acquisition of our customers by certain of our competitors, and (iii) continued periods of net losses, which could require us to find additional sources of financing to fund operations, implement our financial and business strategies, meet anticipated capital expenditures and fund research and development costs. In addition, assumptions relating to budgeting, marketing, product development and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments, the impact of which may cause us to alter our marketing, capital expenditure or other budgets, which may in turn affect our financial position and results of operations. For all of these reasons, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. We assume no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except as required by law.

Our uses of cash for operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees; costs incurred in connection with performance on client projects; material, management consulting and professional fees. The sources of our cash flows from operating activities have consisted primarily of payments received from clients in connection with the performance on contractually agreed-upon projects. Net cash flows from operating activities for the current period were a result of the net loss of 117,490, depreciation expense of 9,656, change of deferred tax of 38,751 and changes in current assets and liabilities of 479,884. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 310,247 was used in operating activities, which was a result of the net income of 402,959, depreciation expense of 11,288, loss on disposal of equipment of 329, change of deferred tax of 48,630 and changes in current assets and liabilities of 773,453. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we purchased 0 and 8,646 in computer equipment, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company also received 1,200 in an insurance payout on equipment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have any cash flow activity from financing activities. The ability to attract additional capital investments for more rapid expansion in the future will depend on many factors, including the availability of credit, rate of revenue growth, ability to acquire new client opportunities, the timing of new service product introductions and enhancements to existing services/products, and the opportunities to acquire complimentary businesses that may be made available to us from time-to-time. We believe that as of September 30, 2024, our cash position and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and planned strategic activities, excluding acquisitions, if any, for at least the next twelve months. Any potential future sale of equity or debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders, and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are required to raise additional financing, but are unable to obtain such financing, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more aspects of our operations or business development activities. This Report on Form 10-Q contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Litigation Reform Act ). These forward-looking statements and other information are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by us using information currently available. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Not applicable. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were not effective as of September 30, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to (i) insufficient segregation of duties in the finance and accounting functions due to limited personnel; and (ii) inadequate corporate governance policies. In the future, subject to working capital limitations, we intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make improvements to remediate these deficiencies. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 15 Table of Contents Part II. Other Information Item1. Legal Proceedings On February 11, 2022, a Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (the Complaint was filed by a plaintiff (the Plaintiff in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Complaint named Mastermind, Inc. the Company and Daniel Dodson, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, (the CEO ). The Company and the CEO are collectively referred to herein as Defendants . The Complaint includes alleged breach of contract and alleged breach of implied contract by the Defendants related to the Plaintiff s allegations that he was entitled to 3,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company from the reverse merger transaction completed on February 14, 2018. The Defendants successfully got the Complaint transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. In September of 2023, the court dismissed in part the breach of contract claims against the CEO and the Company. The alleged breach of implied contract by the Defendants is pending further litigation. The Defendants will contest the complaint and strongly believe they will prevail. As of March 11, 2024 Mastermind was successful at getting the lawsuit dismissed. On March 8, 2024 Cimino s attorney filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, and the clerk accepted the stipulation and dismissed and closed the case. The dismissal with prejudice (as opposed to without) would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible for Cimino to revive an action against Mastermind based upon the same facts/transactions. Other than the above, we are not a party to any legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, which we believe will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
