The 2025 Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of shares per principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of the Company s common stock), subject to adjustment if certain events occur. The initial conversion price represents a conversion premium of approximately over per share, the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock on April 13, 2020 (the pricing date of the offering) on the New York Stock Exchange. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, the Company made an irrevocable settlement election for any conversions of the 2025 Convertible Notes. Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash for the principal amount. For any excess above principal, the Company will deliver shares of its common stock. The Company was not permitted to redeem the 2025 Convertible Notes prior to April 15, 2023. From and after April 15, 2023, the Company is able to redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, at its option, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock is equal to or greater than of the conversion price for a specified period of time, at a redemption price equal to of the principal aggregate amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

In connection with certain corporate events or if the Company issues a notice of redemption, it will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert their 2025 Convertible Notes in connection with such corporate event or during the relevant redemption period for such 2025 Convertible Notes.

The Company exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Convertible Notes. This exchange resulted in aggregate pre-tax debt extinguishment charges of million. The Company also issued approximately million in aggregate principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes in a private placement to certain investors. An aggregate of up to shares of common stock may be issued upon conversion of the 2027 Convertible Notes, which number is subject to adjustment up to an aggregate of shares following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if the Company issues a notice of redemption, and which is also subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments.

Thereafter, the 2027 Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The 2027 Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of shares per principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of the Company s common stock), subject to adjustment if certain events occur. The initial conversion price represents a conversion premium of approximately over per share, the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock on September 7, 2023 on The New York Stock Exchange. Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes being converted, and pay (and deliver, if applicable) cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination thereof, at its election, in respect of the remainder (if any) of the Company s conversion obligation in excess of such aggregate principal amount. The Company will not be able to redeem the 2027 Convertible Notes prior to December 20, 2025. On or after December 20, 2025 and prior to the 21st scheduled trading day immediately preceding December 15, 2027, the Company will be able to redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Convertible Notes, at its option, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock is equal to or greater than of the conversion price for a specified period of time, at a redemption price equal to

The interest rate margin applicable under the ABL Line of Credit is to in the case of a daily SOFR rate or a term SOFR rate (in each case, plus a credit spread adjustment of ), and to in the case of a prime rate, depending on the average daily availability of the lesser of (a) the total commitments or (b) the borrowing base. The ABL Line of Credit is collateralized by a first priority lien on BCFWC s and each guarantor's inventory, receivables, bank accounts, and certain related assets and proceeds thereof (subject to certain exceptions), and a second priority lien on BCFWC s and each guarantor's other assets and proceeds thereof (other than real estate and subject to certain exceptions). On June 26, 2023, BCFWC entered into a Fifth Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which increased the sublimit for letters of credit thereunder from million to million. The letter of credit sublimit was automatically reduced to million on July 1, 2024, and million on October 1, 2024, and will be automatically reduced to million on January 1, 2025.

Long-lived assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for purposes of calculating impairment using the fair value hierarchy of ASC 820. The fair value of the Company s long-lived assets is calculated using a discounted cash-flow model that used level 3 inputs. In calculating future cash flows, the Company makes estimates regarding future operating results and market rent rates, based on its experience and knowledge of market factors in which the retail location is located.

BURLINGTON STORES, INC. 
 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 (Fiscal 2023 10-K). 
 In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results or other events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed under the section of this Item 2 entitled Safe Harbor Statement. 
 Executive Summary 
 Introduction 
 We are a nationally recognized off-price retailer of high-quality, branded merchandise at everyday low prices. We opened our first store in Burlington, New Jersey in 1972, selling primarily coats and outerwear. Since then, we have expanded our store base to 1,103 stores as of November 2, 2024 in 46 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. We have diversified our product categories by offering an extensive selection of in-season, fashion-focused merchandise at up to 60 off other retailers prices, including: women s ready-to-wear apparel, menswear, youth apparel, baby, beauty, footwear, accessories, home, toys, gifts and coats. We sell a broad selection of desirable, first-quality, current-brand, labeled merchandise acquired directly from nationally-recognized manufacturers and other suppliers. 
 Fiscal Year 
 Fiscal 2024 is defined as the 52-week year ended February 1, 2025. Fiscal 2023 is defined as the 53-week year ending February 3, 2024. The first, second, and third quarters of Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 each consist of 13 weeks. 
 Store Openings, Closings, and Relocations 
 During the nine month period ended November 2, 2024, we opened 139 new stores, inclusive of 30 relocations, and permanently closed 13 stores, exclusive of the aforementioned relocations, bringing our store count as of November 2, 2024 to 1,103 stores. 
 Ongoing Initiatives 
 We continue to focus on a number of ongoing initiatives aimed at increasing our overall profitability. These initiatives include, but are not limited to: 
 Driving Comparable Store Sales Growth. 

We strive to increase comparable store sales through the following initiatives: 
 More Effectively Chasing the Sales Trend. We plan sales using conservative comparable store sales growth, holding and controlling liquidity, closely analyzing the sales trend by business, and remaining ready to chase that trend. We believe that these actions will also allow us to take more advantage of great opportunistic buys. 

Operating with Leaner Inventories. We are planning to carry less inventory in our stores going forward compared to historical levels, which we believe should result in the customer finding a higher mix of fresh receipts and great merchandise values. We believe that this should drive faster turns and lower markdowns, while simultaneously improving our customers shopping experience. 

Investment in Merchandising Capabilities. We plan to continue investing in training and coaching, improved tools and reporting, incremental headcount, especially in growing or under-developed businesses, and other forms of 

21 

merchant support. We believe that these investments should improve our ability to strengthen vendor relationships, source great merchandise buys, more accurately assess value, and better forecast and chase the sales trend. 

Enhancing Existing Categories and Introducing New Categories. We have opportunities to expand our offerings in certain existing categories, such as ladies apparel, beauty, and home merchandise, and maintain the flexibility to introduce new categories as we expand our merchandising capabilities. 

Expanding and Enhancing Our Retail Store Base. 

We intend to expand and enhance our retail store base through the following initiatives: 
 Adhering to a Market Focused and Financially Disciplined Real Estate Strategy. We have grown our store base consistently since our founding in 1972. We believe there is significant opportunity to expand our retail store base in the United States. As a result of our smaller store prototype, we have identified numerous market opportunities that we believe will allow us to operate 2,000 stores over the long term. Beginning in Fiscal 2024, we expect to average about 100 net new stores per year through Fiscal 2028, for a total of 500 net new stores over the five-year period. 

Enhancing the Store Experience. We continue to invest in select store relocations and downsizes to improve the customer experience, taking into consideration the age, size, sales, and location of a store. Relocations provide an opportunity, upon lease expirations, to right-size our stores, improve our competitive positioning, incorporate our new prototype store designs and reduce occupancy costs. Downsizes provide an opportunity to right-size our stores, within our existing space, improve co-tenancy, incorporate our new store designs and reduce occupancy costs. 

Enhancing Operating Margins. 

We intend to increase our operating margins through the following initiatives: 
 Improving Operational Flexibility. Our store and supply chain teams must continue to respond to the sales chase, enhancing their ability at flexing up and down based on trends, and allowing us to maximize leverage on sales. 

Optimizing Markdowns. We believe that our markdown system allows us to maximize sales and gross margin dollars based on forward-looking sales forecasts, sell-through targets and exit dates. Additionally, as we plan to carry less inventory in our stores compared to historical levels, we expect to drive faster turns, which should reduce the amount of markdowns taken compared to historical levels. 

Optimizing the Supply Chain. O ur transportation initiatives have led to lower freight costs compared to recent levels, and we believe our efficiency and labor productivity initiatives will continue to result in lower supply chain costs over the next several years. We also believe there are longer-term supply chain opportunities through investments in automation. 

Challenging Expenses to Drive Operating Leverage. We believe sales growth will drive fixed cost operating leverage. In addition, by more conservatively planning our comparable store sales growth, we are forcing even tighter expense control throughout all areas of our business. We believe that this should put us in a strong position to drive favorable operating leverage on any sales ahead of the plan. Additionally, we plan to continue challenging the processes and operating norms throughout the organization with the belief that this will lead to incremental efficiency improvements and savings. 

Uncertainties and Challenges 
 As we strive to increase profitability, there are uncertainties and challenges that we face that could have a material impact on our revenues or income. Some of these uncertainties and challenges are summarized below. For a further discussion, please refer to the description under the heading Risk Factors in the Fiscal 2023 10-K. 
 General Economic Conditions. There remains a high level of uncertainty in the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, and prolonged inflationary pressures continue to negatively impact the discretionary spending of the low-income shopper, our core customer. In addition to inflation, consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing global economic conditions, the costs of basic necessities and other goods, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, reductions in government benefits and lower tax refunds, housing costs, energy costs, commodities pricing, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns are generally influenced by consumers disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. 
 22 

A broad, protracted slowdown or downturn in the U.S. economy, an extended period of high unemployment or inflation rates, an uncertain domestic or global economic outlook or a financial crisis could adversely affect consumer spending habits resulting in lower net sales and profits than expected on a quarterly or annual basis. Conversely, if inflation continues to decline, it could benefit our core customers who have been impacted by the higher cost of living since early 2022, and if economic growth slows, it could cause moderate and higher-income shoppers to become more value conscious. Both of these developments, if they occur, would be expected to improve our business. Consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation. Our financial condition and operations could be impacted by changes in government regulations in areas including, but not limited to, trade and tariffs, taxes and healthcare. In addition, trade and tariff regulations could have an indirect impact on consumer prices. The outbreak or escalation of war, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the U.S., or public health issues such as pandemics or epidemics, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. In addition, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and acts of war or conflicts in various parts of the world (such as the conflict in Ukraine or the Hamas-Israel war), could have the effect of disrupting supplies and raising prices globally which, in turn, may have adverse effects on the world and U.S. economies and lead to a downturn in consumer confidence and spending. 
 We closely monitor our net sales, gross margin and expenses. We have performed scenario planning such that if our net sales decline for an extended period of time, we have identified variable costs that could be reduced to partially mitigate the impact of these declines. If we were to experience adverse sales trends and if our efforts to counteract the impacts of these trends are not sufficiently effective, there could be a negative impact on our financial performance and position in future fiscal periods. 
 Seasonality of Sales and Weather Conditions . Our business, like that of most retailers, is subject to seasonal influences. In the second half of the year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons, we generally realize a higher level of sales and net income. 
 Weather continues to be a contributing factor to the sale of our merchandise. Generally, our sales are higher if the weather is cold during the Fall and warm during the early Spring. Sales of cold weather clothing are generally increased by early cold weather during the Fall, while sales of warm weather clothing are generally increased by early warm weather conditions in the Spring. Although we have diversified our product offerings, we believe traffic to our stores is still driven, in part, by weather patterns. 
 Competition and Margin Pressure. We believe that in order to remain competitive with retailers, including off-price retailers and discount stores, we must continue to offer brand-name merchandise at a discount to prices offered by other retailers as well as an assortment of merchandise that is appealing to our customers. 
 The U.S. retail apparel and home furnishings markets are highly fragmented and competitive. We compete for business with department stores, off-price retailers, internet retailers, specialty stores, discount stores, wholesale clubs, and outlet stores as well as with certain traditional, full-price retail chains that have developed off-price concepts. At various times throughout the year, traditional full-price department store chains and specialty shops offer brand-name merchandise at substantial markdowns, which can result in prices approximating those offered by us at our Burlington Stores. We anticipate that competition will increase in the future. Therefore, we will continue to look for ways to differentiate our stores from those of our competitors. 
 The U.S. retail industry continues to face increased pressure on margins as overall challenging retail conditions have led consumers to be more value conscious. Additionally, lower-to-moderate income shoppers continue to face economic pressure due to higher cost of living. Our strategy to chase the sales trend allows us the flexibility to purchase less pre-season merchandise with the balance purchased in-season and opportunistically. It also provides us with the flexibility to shift purchases between suppliers and categories. We believe that this enables us to obtain better terms with our suppliers, which we expect will help offset any rising costs of goods. 
 We have previously experienced inflationary pressure in our supply chain and with respect to raw materials and finished goods, as well as in occupancy and other operating costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to offset inflationary pressure in the future by increasing prices or through other means, or that our business will not be negatively affected by continued inflation in the future. 
 Key Performance and Non-GAAP Measures 
 We consider numerous factors in assessing our performance. Key performance and non-GAAP measures used by management include net income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, comparable store sales, gross margin, inventory, and liquidity. 
 Net income . We earned net income of 90.6 million during the three month period ended November 2, 2024 compared with net income of 48.6 million during the three month period ended October 28, 2023. We earned net income of 242.9 million during the 
 23 

nine month period ended November 2, 2024 compared with a net income of 112.2 million during the nine month period ended October 28, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales, as well as increased gross margin rate. Refer to the section below entitled Results of Operations for further explanation. 
 Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT : Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT are non-GAAP financial measures of our performance. 
 We define Adjusted Net Income as net income, exclusive of the following items, if applicable: (i) net favorable lease costs; (ii) loss on extinguishment of debt; (iii) costs related to debt amendments; (iv) impairment charges; (v) amounts related to certain litigation matters; and (vi) other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains, all of which are tax effected to arrive at Adjusted Net Income. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income, exclusive of the following items, if applicable: (i) interest expense; (ii) interest income; (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt; (iv) costs related to debt amendments; (v) income tax expense; (vi) depreciation and amortization; (vii) net favorable lease costs; (viii) impairment charges; (ix) amounts related to certain litigation matters; and (x) other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains. 
 We define Adjusted EBIT as net income, exclusive of the following items, if applicable: (i) interest expense; (ii) interest income; (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt; (iv) costs related to debt amendments; (v) income tax expense; (vi) impairment charges; (vii) net favorable lease costs; (viii) amounts related to certain litigation matters; and (ix) other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains. 
 We present Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT because we believe they are useful supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our business and provide greater transparency into our results of operations. In particular, we believe that excluding certain items that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from what we consider to be our core operating results are useful supplemental measures that assist investors and management in evaluating our ability to generate earnings and leverage sales, and to more readily compare core operating results between past and future periods. 
 We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors helpful information with respect to our operations and financial condition. Other companies in the retail industry may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently such that our calculation may not be directly comparable. 
 Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Among other limitations, Adjusted Net Income does not reflect the following items, net of their tax effect: 
 net favorable lease costs; 

losses on extinguishment of debt; 

costs related to debt amendments; 

impairment charges on long-lived assets; 

amounts charged for certain litigation matters; and 

other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains. 

During the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024, Adjusted Net Income increased 36.1 million to 99.9 million and increased 106.5 million to 264.2 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. These increases were primarily driven by higher sales, as well as increased gross margin rate. Refer to the section below entitled Results of Operations for further explanation.

Comparable Store Sales. Comparable store sales measure performance of a store during the current reporting period against the performance of the same store in the corresponding period of a prior year. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our definition of comparable store sales may differ from other retailers. 
 We define comparable store sales as merchandise sales of those stores commencing on the first day of the fiscal month one year after the end of their grand opening activities, which normally conclude within the first two months of operations. If a store is closed for seven or more days during a month, our policy is to remove that store from our calculation of comparable store sales for any such month, as well as during the month(s) of their grand re-opening activities. To account for the shift in weeks from the 53rd week of Fiscal 2023, comparable store sales for three month period ended November 2, 2024 and the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 are comparing the 13 and 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024, to the 13 and 39 weeks ended November 4, 2023, respectively. The change in our comparable store sales was as follows:

Various factors affect comparable store sales, including, but not limited to, weather conditions, current economic conditions, the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events, the general retail sales environment, consumer preferences and buying trends, changes in sales mix among distribution channels, competition, and the success of marketing programs. 
 Gross Margin. Gross margin is the difference between net sales and the cost of sales. Our cost of sales and gross margin may not be comparable to those of other entities, since some entities may include all of the costs related to their buying and distribution functions, certain store-related costs and other costs, in cost of sales. We include certain of these costs in the line items Selling, general and administrative expenses and Depreciation and amortization in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. We 
 26 

include in our Cost of sales line item all costs of merchandise (net of purchase discounts and certain vendor allowances), inbound freight, distribution center outbound freight and certain merchandise acquisition costs, primarily commissions and import fees. 
 Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 43.9 during the three month period ended November 2, 2024, compared with 43.2 during three month period ended October 28, 2023, driven primarily by lower markdowns and higher markups, as well as improved freight expense. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 43.4 during the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared with 42.4 during the nine months ended October 28, 2023, driven primarily by lower markdowns, as well as decreased freight costs and higher markups. 
 Product sourcing costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, decreased approximately 50 basis points as a percentage of net sales during the three month period ended November 2, 2024, compared with the three month period ended October 28, 2023, primarily driven by supply chain efficiency initiatives. Product sourcing costs decreased approximately 70 basis points as a percentage of net sales during the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared with the nine months ended October 28, 2023, primarily driven by supply chain efficiency initiatives. Product sourcing costs include the costs of processing goods through our supply chain and buying costs. 
 Inventory. Inventory at November 2, 2024 increased to 1,440.7 million compared with 1,329.1 million at October 28, 2023. The increase was attributable primarily to 126 net new stores opened since the end of the third quarter of Fiscal 2023 and an increase in reserve inventory, partially offset by a decrease in comparable store inventory. 
 Reserve inventory includes all inventory that is being stored for release either later in the season, or in a subsequent season. We intend to use our reserve merchandise to effectively chase sales trends. 
 In order to better serve our customers and maximize sales, we continue to refine our merchandising mix and inventory levels within our stores. By appropriately managing our inventories, we believe we will be better able to deliver a continual flow of fresh merchandise to our customers. 
 Liquidity. Liquidity measures our ability to generate cash. Management measures liquidity through cash flow, which is the measure of cash generated from or used in operating, financing, and investing activities. Cash and cash equivalents decreased 67.6 million during the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared with a decrease of 263.3 million during the nine months ended October 28, 2023. Refer to the section below entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources for further explanation.

Three Month Period Ended November 2, 2024 Compared With the Three Month Period Ended October 28, 2023 
 Net sales	 
 Net sales improved approximately 241.5 million, or 10.6 , to 2,526.2 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024, primarily driven by the net sales of 126 net new stores since the end of the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, as well as an increase of 1 in comparable stores sales during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024. 
 Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 56.1 during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024, compared to 56.8 during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by improved markdowns, freight expense, and initial markups. On a dollar basis, cost of sales increased 120.3 million, or 9.3 , primarily driven by our overall increase in sales. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 35.4 during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024, compared to 36.2 during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by an improvement in product sourcing costs, resulting from supply chain efficiency initiatives, as well as the impact of purchased Bed, Bath Beyond leases on occupancy costs in Fiscal 2023. 
 
 During Fiscal 2023, we acquired 64 store leases directly from Bed, Bath Beyond. We started paying rent immediately upon acquisition for all of the stores. We opened 32 of these stores during Fiscal 2023, 20 during the first quarter of Fiscal 2024, 11 during the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, and the remaining store during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024. This transaction resulted in 9.6 million of selling, general and administrative expenses during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. There were no incremental costs related to acquired Bed, Bath Beyond leases during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024. 
 
 On a dollar basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 66.3 million, or 8.0 , to 893.1 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily driven by our 126 net new stores opened since the end of the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to 87.5 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024 compared with 76.1 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily driven by capital expenditures related to new and non-comparable stores, as well as our supply chain initiatives. 
 Impairment charges long-lived assets 
 Impairment charges on long-lived assets were 3.0 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024, primarily related to two stores relocated and closed before the end of the respective lease-end dates. Impairment charges on long-lived assets were 0.8 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, related to unrecoverable fixed assets at eight underperforming stores. 
 The recoverability assessment related to these store-level assets requires various judgments and estimates, including estimates related to future revenues, gross margin rates, store expenses and other assumptions. We base these estimates upon our past and expected future performance. We believe our estimates are appropriate in light of current market conditions. However, future impairment charges could be required if we do not achieve our current revenue or cash flow projections for each store. Refer to Note 6, Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion regarding impairment charges. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 During the third quarter of Fiscal 2024, debt extinguishment charges amounted to 1.4 million related to the partial write-off of the original issue discount and deferred debt costs, as a result of the September 2024 upsize and extension of our Term Loan Facility. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, we entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes. Under the terms of the exchange agreements, the holders exchanged 241.2 million in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes held by them for 255.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25 Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (2027 Convertible Notes). These exchanges resulted in aggregate pre-tax debt extinguishment charges of 13.6 million. 
 28 

Interest expense 
 Interest expense improved 1.9 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024 to 17.8 million, compared to the same period in the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by a reduction in interest expense related to accumulated other comprehensive income on our previous interest rate swap, which was fully amortized as of the end of Fiscal 2023. Additionally, we had a lower interest rate on the 2027 Convertible Notes compared to the 2025 Convertible Notes that were extinguished, partially offset by a higher average balance of the Term Loan Facility due to the September 2024 extension and upsize of the Term Loan Facility during Q3 2024. 
 The average interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was 7.0 and 7.4 for the third quarter of Fiscal 2024 and the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, respectively. The average balance on the Term Loan Facility, excluding the original issue discount, was 1,068.6 million and 941.4 million for the third quarter of Fiscal 2024 and the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, respectively. 
 Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense was 27.4 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024 compared with income tax expense of 18.3 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of Fiscal 2024 was 23.2 compared with 27.4 during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. The increase in income tax expense is due to higher pre-tax income. The higher tax rate in the prior period is primarily attributable to the disallowance of certain debt extinguishment costs related to the partial repurchase of the 2025 Convertible Notes and higher tax expense from stock-based compensation. 
 At the end of each interim period we are required to determine the best estimate of our annual effective tax rate and then apply that rate in providing for income taxes on a current year-to-date (interim period) basis. Use of this methodology during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024 resulted in an annual effective income tax rate of approximately 26 (before discrete items) as our best estimate. 
 Net income	 
 We earned net income of 90.6 million for the third quarter of Fiscal 2024 compared with 48.6 million for the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales, as well as increased gross margin rate. Net income included 7.0 million of expense, net of income taxes, for the third quarter of Fiscal 2023 related to the leases acquired from Bed Bath Beyond. 
 
 Nine Month Period Ended November 2, 2024 Compared With the Nine Month Period Ended October 28, 2023 
 Net sales	 
 Net sales improved approximately 756.8 million, or 11.5 , to 7,344.7 million during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024, primarily driven by the net sales of 126 net new stores opened since the end of the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, as well as an increase of 2 in comparable stores sales during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024. 
 Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 56.6 during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024, compared to 57.6 during the nine month period ended October 28, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by decreased markdowns, as well as lower freight costs and higher initial markups. On a dollar basis, cost of sales increased 361.3 million, or 9.5 , primarily driven by our overall increase in sales. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 35.2 during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024, compared to 35.8 during the nine month period ended October 28, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by an improvement in product sourcing costs, resulting from supply chain efficiency initiatives, partially offset by investments in store payroll costs. On a dollar basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 224.6 million, or 9.5 , to 2,582.3 million during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by our 126 net new stores opened since the end of the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. 
 Our acquisition of the Bed, Bath Beyond store leases resulted in 9.4 million and 12.3 million of selling, general and administrative expenses during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 and the nine month period ended October 28, 2023, respectively. 
 29 

Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to 256.1 million during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 compared with 219.7 million during the nine month period ended October 28, 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily driven by capital expenditures related to new and non-comparable stores, as well as our supply chain initiatives. 
 Impairment charges long-lived assets 
 Impairment charges on long-lived assets were 11.3 million during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024, related to one owned store selling below carrying value in a sale-leaseback transaction and two stores relocating and planned to close before the end of the respective lease-end dates. Impairment charges on long-lived assets were 6.4 million during the nine month period ended October 28, 2023, related to unrecoverable fixed assets at 11 underperforming stores and unrecoverable lease assets at three of those stores. 
 The recoverability assessment related to these store-level assets requires various judgments and estimates, including estimates related to future revenues, gross margin rates, store expenses and other assumptions. We base these estimates upon our past and expected future performance. We believe our estimates are appropriate in light of current market conditions. However, future impairment charges could be required if we do not achieve our current revenue or cash flow projections for each store. Refer to Note 6, Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion regarding impairment charges. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 During the nine month period ended November 2, 2024, debt extinguishment charges amounted to 1.4 million related to the partial write-off of the original issue discount and deferred debt costs, as a result of the September 2024 extension and upsize of our Term Loan Facility. During the nine month period ended October 28, 2023, we entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes, whereby the holders exchanged 241.2 million in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes held by them for 255.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes, as well as 110.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes held by them for 133.3 million in cash. These exchanges resulted in aggregate pre-tax debt extinguishment charges of 38.3 million. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense improved 7.6 million during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 to 51.0 million, compared to the same period in the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by a reduction in interest expense related to accumulated other comprehensive income on our previous interest rate swap, which was fully amortized as of the end of Fiscal 2023. Additionally, we had a lower average balance of 2025 Convertible Notes, and a lower interest rate on the 2027 Convertible Notes compared to the 2025 Convertible Notes that were extinguished, partially offset by a higher average balance due to the September 2024 extension and upsize of the Term Loan Facility during Q3 2024, as well as a higher interest rate on the unhedged portion of the Term Loan Facility. 
 The average interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was 7.3 and 7.1 for the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 and the nine month period ended October 28, 2023, respectively. The average balance on the Term Loan Facility, excluding the original issue discount, was 979.7 million and 943.8 million for the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 and the nine month period ended October 28, 2023, respectively. 
 Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense was 84.5 million during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 compared with income tax expense of 40.0 million during the nine month period ended October 28, 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 was 25.8 compared with 26.3 during the nine month period ended October 28, 2023. The increase in income tax expense is due to higher pre-tax income. The higher tax rate in the prior period is primarily attributable to the disallowance of certain debt extinguishment costs related to the partial repurchase of the 2025 Convertible Notes. 
 At the end of each interim period we are required to determine the best estimate of our annual effective tax rate and then apply that rate in providing for income taxes on a current year-to-date (interim period) basis. Use of this methodology during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 resulted in an annual effective income tax rate of approximately 26 (before discrete items) as our best estimate.

Net income	 
 We earned net income of 242.9 million for the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 compared with 112.2 million for the nine month period ended October 28, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales, as well as increased gross margin rate. Net income included 6.8 million and 9.1 million of expense, net of income taxes, for the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 and the nine month period ended October 28, 2023, respectively, related to the leases acquired from Bed Bath Beyond. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources	 
 Our ability to satisfy interest payment and future principal payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service interest payment and future principal payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations, our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. We cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed on terms similar to our current financing agreements, or at all. 
 We believe that cash generated from operations, along with our existing cash and our ABL Line of Credit, will be sufficient to fund our expected cash flow requirements and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we would be able to offset declines in our comparable store sales with savings initiatives. 
 As market conditions warrant, we may, from time to time, repurchase our outstanding debt securities in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer, by exchange transaction or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved and total consideration paid may be material. 
 From time to time, we evaluate options to opportunistically increase, refinance or extend our debt. Our assessment will be based on our capital needs for, among other things, facility capital improvements and expenditures. No assurance can be given that we will enter into such agreements. 
 Cash Flow for the Nine Month Period Ended November 2, 2024 Compared With the Nine Month Period Ended October 28, 2023 
 We used 67.6 million of cash during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 compared with a use of 263.3 million during the nine month period ended October 28, 2023. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to 320.2 million during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024, compared with 270.2 million during the nine month period ended October 28, 2023. The increase in our operating cash flows was primarily driven by improved sales and gross margin, as well as the impact of changes in working capital. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 535.9 million during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 compared with 311.3 million during the nine month period ended October 28, 2023. This change was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures related to increased store openings as well as supply chain initiatives. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 148.1 million during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024 compared with net cash used of 222.3 million during the nine month period ended October 28, 2023. This change was primarily driven by the September 2024 extension and upsizing of the Term Loan Facility during the third quarter of Fiscal 2024 as well as net payment on the Convertible Notes during Fiscal 2023, partially offset by increased repurchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in Fiscal 2024. 
 Changes in working capital also impact our cash flows. Working capital equals current assets minus current liabilities. We had working capital at November 2, 2024 of 389.0 million compared with 260.3 million at October 28, 2023. The increase in working capital was primarily due to an increased cash balance, increased inventory, and increased prepaid assets, partially offset by increased accounts payable and increased current maturities of long term debt related to the 2025 Convertible Notes. We had working capital at February 3, 2024 of 298.2 million. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 For the nine month period ended November 2, 2024, capital expenditures, net of 9.3 million of landlord allowances, amounted to 500.6 million (inclusive of accrued capital expenditures). 
 31 

We estimate that we will spend approximately 750 million, net of approximately 40 million of landlord allowances, in capital expenditures during Fiscal 2024, including approximately 340 million, net of the previously mentioned landlord allowances, for store expenditures (new stores, remodels and other store expenditures). In addition, we estimate that we will spend approximately 210 million to support our supply chain initiatives, with the remaining capital used to support our information technology and other business initiatives. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On August 15, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of common stock, which is authorized to be executed through August 2025. 
 During the nine month period ended November 2, 2024, we repurchased 795,118 shares of common stock for 180.5 million under these repurchase programs. As of November 2, 2024, we had 324.6 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. 
 We are authorized to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions under our repurchase program. The timing and amount of stock repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the market conditions as well as corporate and regulatory considerations. Our share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock under the program. 
 Dividends 
 We currently do, and intend to continue to, retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund all of the Company's capital expenditures, business initiatives, and to support any potential opportunistic capital structure initiatives. Therefore, at this time, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the near term. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be limited by restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions under the terms of current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to compliance with covenants in our current and future agreements governing our indebtedness, and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. 
 In addition, since we are a holding company, substantially all of the assets shown on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our earnings, cash flow and ability to pay dividends are largely dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of our subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings to us in the form of dividends. 
 Operational Growth 
 During the nine month period ended November 2, 2024, we opened 139 new stores, inclusive of 30 relocations, and closed 13 stores, exclusive of the aforementioned relocations, bringing our store count as of November 2, 2024 to 1,103 stores. During Fiscal 2024, we plan to open 101 net new stores. 
 Debt and Hedging 
 As of November 2, 2024, our obligations, inclusive of original issue discount, include 1,241.7 million under our Term Loan Facility, 453.2 million of Convertible Notes and no outstanding borrowings on our ABL Line of Credit. Our debt obligations also include 25.5 million of finance lease obligations as of November 2, 2024. 
 Term Loan Facility 
 BCFWC and certain of its subsidiaries and holding companies are party to a Credit Agreement (as amended, supplemented and otherwise modified, the Term Loan Facility) that provides for term loans in an aggregate principal amount as of November 2, 2024 of 1,250 million maturing on September 24, 2031. 
 On September 24, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Term Loan Facility dated as of February 24, 2011 (the "Amendment"), which among other things, (i) refinanced the outstanding 933 million principal amount of Term B-6 Loans with Term B-7 Loans in an aggregate principal amount of 1,250 million, which includes incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of 317 million, (ii) extended the maturity date from June 24, 2028 to September 24, 2031, and (iii) reduced the interest rate margins applicable to our term loan facility from 1.00 to 0.75 , in the case of prime rate loans, and from 2.00 to 1.75 , in the 
 32 

case of SOFR loans, with a 0.00 SOFR floor, and removed the SOFR adjustment. The Term B-7 Loans were issued with an original issue discount of 99.5. 
 At November 2, 2024, our borrowing rate related to the Term Loan Facility was 6.4 . 
 ABL Line of Credit 
 BCFWC and certain of its subsidiaries and holding companies are party to a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, supplemented and otherwise modified, the ABL Line of Credit) that provides for 900.0 million of revolving commitments (subject to a borrowing base limitation) maturing on December 22, 2026, and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, BCFWC can increase the aggregate amount of commitments up to 1,200 million. The interest rate margin applicable under the ABL Line of Credit is 1.125 to 1.375 in the case of a daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rate or a term SOFR rate (in each case, plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 ), and 0.125 to 0.375 in the case of a prime rate, depending on the average daily availability of the lesser of (a) the total commitments or (b) the borrowing base. The ABL Line of Credit is collateralized by a first priority lien on BCFWC s and each guarantor's inventory, receivables, bank accounts, and certain related assets and proceeds thereof (subject to certain exceptions), and a second priority lien on BCFWC s and each guarantor's other assets and proceeds thereof (other than real estate and subject to certain exceptions). 
 On June 26, 2023, BCFWC entered into a Fifth Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which increased the sublimit for letters of credit thereunder from 150 million to 250 million. The letter of credit sublimit was automatically reduced to 225 million on July 1, 2024, and 212.5 million on October 1, 2024, and will be automatically reduced to 200 million on January 1, 2025. 
 At November 2, 2024, we had 847.5 million available under the ABL Line of Credit. There were no borrowings on the ABL Line of Credit during the nine month period ended November 2, 2024. 
 2025 Convertible Notes 
 On April 16, 2020, we issued 805.0 million of 2025 Convertible Notes. The 2025 Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of 4.5418 shares per 1,000 principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 220.18 per share of the Company s common stock), subject to adjustment if certain events occur. 
 The 2025 Convertible Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The 2025 Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.25 per year, payable semi-annually in cash, in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2020. The 2025 Convertible Notes will mature on April 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. 
 During the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, we entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes. Under the terms of the exchange agreements, the holders exchanged 110.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes held by them for 133.3 million in cash. These exchanges resulted in aggregate pre-tax debt extinguishment charges of 24.6 million. 
 Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 15, 2025, the 2025 Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods. Thereafter, the 2025 Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The 2025 Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of 4.5418 shares per 1,000 principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 220.18 per share of our common stock), subject to adjustment if certain events occur. The initial conversion price represents a conversion premium of approximately 32.50 over 166.17 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on April 13, 2020 (the pricing date of the offering) on the New York Stock Exchange. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, the Company made an irrevocable settlement election for any conversions of the 2025 Convertible Notes. Upon conversion, we will pay cash for the principal amount. For any excess above principal, we will deliver shares of its common stock. We were not permitted to redeem the 2025 Convertible Notes prior to April 15, 2023. From and after April 15, 2023, we are able to redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, at its option, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock is equal to or greater than 130 of the conversion price for a specified period of time, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal aggregate amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
 Holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase their 2025 Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of certain events that constitute a fundamental change under the indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. In connection with certain corporate events or if we issue a notice of redemption, it will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert their 2025 Convertible Notes in connection with such corporate event or during the relevant redemption period for such 2025 Convertible Notes. 
 33 

2027 Convertible Notes 
 On September 12, 2023, we closed the issuance of approximately 297.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 2027 Convertible Notes pursuant to separate, privately negotiated exchange and subscription agreements with a limited number of holders of our 2025 Convertible Notes and certain investors, in each case pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. We exchanged approximately 241.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes for approximately 255.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Convertible Notes. We also issued approximately 42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes in a private placement to certain investors. An aggregate of up to 1,422,568 shares of common stock may be issued upon conversion of the 2027 Convertible Notes, which number is subject to adjustment up to an aggregate of 1,911,372 shares following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if we issue a notice of redemption, and which is also subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. 
 The 2027 Convertible Notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.25 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2023. The 2027 Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2027, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. 
 Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2027, the 2027 Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods. Thereafter, the 2027 Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The 2027 Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of 4.8560 shares per 1,000 principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 205.93 per share of our common stock), subject to adjustment if certain events occur. The initial conversion price represents a conversion premium of approximately 32.50 over 155.42 per share, the last reported sale price of our common stock on September 7, 2023 on The New York Stock Exchange. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes being converted, and pay (and deliver, if applicable) cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at its election, in respect of the remainder (if any) of our conversion obligation in excess of such aggregate principal amount. We will not be able to redeem the 2027 Convertible Notes prior to December 20, 2025. On or after December 20, 2025 and prior to the 21st scheduled trading day immediately preceding December 15, 2027, we will be able to redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Convertible Notes, at its option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock is equal to or greater than 130 of the conversion price for a specified period of time, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
 If we undergo a fundamental change, subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2027 Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of our 2027 New Convertible Notes. The fundamental change repurchase price will be 100 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Convertible Notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. 
 Hedging 
 We have interest rate swaps which hedge 800 million of variable rate exposure under our Term Loan Facility. The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and expire on September 24, 2031. Refer to Note 5, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, for further discussion regarding our derivative transactions. 
 Certain Information Concerning Contractual Obligations 
 We had 1,747.7 million of purchase commitments related to goods that were not received as of November 2, 2024, and had 4,465.9 million of future minimum lease payments under operating leases as of November 2, 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues and other significant areas that involve management s judgments and estimates. The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities; (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements; and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill, insurance reserves, leases and income taxes. Historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances form the basis for making estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change materially in future periods. A critical accounting estimate meets two criteria: (1) it requires assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2) there would be a material effect on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from either using a different, although reasonable, amount within the range of the estimate in the current period or from reasonably likely period-to-period changes in the estimate. 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates are consistent with those disclosed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of the Fiscal 2023 10-K. 
 Safe Harbor Statement 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, the industry in which we operate and other matters, as well as management s beliefs and assumptions and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. For example, when we use words such as projects, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, should, would, could, will, opportunity, potential or may, variations of such words or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes, we are making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Such statements may include, but are not limited to, future impacts of current macroeconomic conditions, proposed store openings and closings, proposed capital expenditures, ongoing strategic initiatives and the intended results of those initiatives, future performance or results, the effect of the adoption of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings. Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors. While it is impossible to identify all such factors, factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those we expected include: general economic conditions, such as inflation, and the domestic and international political situation and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending; competitive factors, including the scale and potential consolidation of some of our competitors, rise of e-commerce spending, pricing and promotional activities of major competitors, and an increase in competition within the markets in which we compete; seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, operating income and inventory levels; the reduction in traffic to, or the closing of, the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located; our ability to identify changing consumer preferences and demand; our ability to meet our environmental, social or governance ESG goals or otherwise expectations of our stakeholders with respect to ESG matters; extreme and/or unseasonable weather conditions caused by climate change or otherwise adversely impacting demand; effects of public health crises, epidemics or pandemics; our ability to sustain our growth plans or successfully implement our long-range strategic plans; our ability to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory management process; our ability to optimize our existing stores or maintain favorable lease terms; the availability, selection and purchasing of attractive brand name merchandise on favorable terms; our ability to attract, train and retain quality employees and temporary personnel in sufficient numbers; labor costs and our ability to manage a large workforce; the solvency of parties with whom we do business and their willingness to perform their obligations to us; import risks, including tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations; disruption in our distribution network; our ability to protect our protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data, breaches of security, or other cyber-related attacks; risks related to the methods of payment we accept; the success of our advertising and marketing programs in generating sufficient levels of customer traffic and awareness; damage to our corporate reputation or brand; impact of potential loss of executives or other key personnel; our ability to comply with existing and changing laws, rules, regulations and local codes; lack of or insufficient insurance coverage; issues with merchandise safety and shrinkage; our ability to comply with increasingly rigorous privacy and data security regulations; impact of legal and regulatory proceedings relating to us; use of social media by us or by third parties our direction in violation of applicable laws and regulations; our ability to generate sufficient cash to fund our operations and service our debt obligations; our ability to comply with covenants in our debt agreements; the consequences of the possible conversion of our convertible notes; our reliance on dividends, distributions and other payments, advance and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations; the volatility of our stock price; the impact of the anti-takeover provisions in our governing 
 35 

documents; impact of potential shareholder activism and other risks discussed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including those under the heading Risk Factors in the Fiscal 2023 10-K. 
 Many of these factors are beyond our ability to predict or control. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, our past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. The cautionary statements referred to in this section also should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that may be issued by us or persons acting on our behalf. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law, even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied in such statements will not be realized. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Our management team, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the last day of the fiscal period covered by this report, November 2, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures means our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of November 2, 2024. 
 During the quarter ended November 2, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
