segments: (i) construction; (ii) medical; (ii) real estate development; and (iv) environmental. The construction segment designs and constructs modular structures built in the Company s factories. In the medical segment, the Company uses its modular technology to (i) provide turnkey solutions to medical testing and treatment and generate revenue from the medical testing and point of care treatment in our medical suites and (ii) sell and lease medical suites and privacy pods. The Company s real estate development segment consists of SG DevCorp (as defined below), our majority owned subsidiary, which builds innovative and green single or multifamily projects in underserved regions nationally using modules Modules built in one of the Company s vertically integrated factories. The environmental segment consists of a sustainable medical and waste management solution that collects waste and treats waste for safe disposal. 
 
 The building products developed with the Company s proprietary technology and design and engineering expertise are generally stronger, more durable, environmentally sensitive, and erected in less time than traditional construction methods. The use of the Company's Modules typically provides between four to six points towards the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED certification levels, including reduced site disturbance, resource reuse, recycled content, innovation in design and use of local and regional materials. Due to the ability of the Modules to satisfy such requirements, the Company believes the products produced utilizing its technology and expertise is a leader in environmentally sustainable construction. 
 
 There are core product offerings that utilize the Company s technology and engineering expertise. The first product offering involves GreenSteel modules, which are the structural core and shell of an SGBlocks building. The Company procures the containers, engineers required openings with structural steel enforcements, paints the SGBlocks and then delivers them on-site, where the customer or a customer s general contractor will complete the entire finish out and installation. The second product offering involves replicating the process to create the GreenSteel product and, in addition, installing selected materials, finishes and systems (including, but not limited to floors, windows, doors, interior painting, electrical wiring and fixtures, plumbing outlets and bathrooms, roofing system) and delivering SGBlocks pre-fabricated containers to the site for a third party licensed general contractor to complete the final finish out and installation. Finally, the third product offering is the completely fabricated and finished SGBlocks building (including but not limited to floors, windows, doors, interior painting, electrical wiring and fixtures, plumbing outlets and bathrooms, roofing systems), including erecting the final unit on site and completing any other final steps. The building is ready for occupancy and/or use as soon as installation is completed. Construction administration and/or project management services are typically included in the Company's product offerings. 
 
 The Company also provides engineering and project management services related to the use and modification of Modules in construction. 
 
 Construction 

During 2020 , the Company formed SG Echo, LLC SG Echo ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company acquired substantially all the assets of Echo DCL Echo ), a Texas limited liability company, except for Echo s real estate holdings for which the Company obtained a right of first refusal. Echo is a container/modular manufacturer based in Durant, Oklahoma specializing in the design and construction of permanent modular and temporary modular buildings and was one of the Company s key supply chain partners. Echo caters to the military, education, administration facilities, healthcare, government, commercial and residential customers. This acquisition has allowed the Company to expand its reach for the Modules and offer an opportunity to vertically integrate a large portion of the Company s cost of goods sold, as well as increase margins, productivity and efficiency in the areas of design, estimating, manufacturing and delivery and to become the manufacturer of the Company's core container and modular product offerings. 

Medical 

As of January 2021 and through the fourth quarter of 2021 , the Company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Chicago Airport Testing LLC CAT ). The Company had a variable interest in CAT as described further below. CAT is in the business of marketing, selling, distributing, leasing and otherwise commercially exploiting certain products and services in the COVID- 19 testing and other medical industry. In addition, during March 2023, the Company formed Safe and Green Medical Corporation. The Company also entered into a joint venture with Clarity Lab Solutions LLC., to provide clinical lab testing related to COVID- 19 , which ceased activities in 2022 . 

Real Estate Development 

During 2021 , the Company formed Safe and Green Development Corporation, formerly, SGB Development Corp. SG DevCorp ), as a wholly-owned by the Company. SG DevCorp was formed with the purpose of real property development utilizing the Company's technologies. As described in Note 2 , the activities of SG DevCorp were deconsolidated and determined to be a discontinued operation. As such, the activities of SG DevCorp are no longer a part of the Company s continuing activities. 

Environmental 

During 2022 , SG Environmental Solutions Corp. SG Environmental was formed and is focused on biomedical waste removal and plans to utilize a patented technology that it licenses to shred and disinfect biomedical waste, rendering the waste disinfected, unrecognizable, and of no greater risk to the public health than residential household waste. 

Reverse Stock Split 

On May 2, 2024, . 

of the issued and outstanding securities of SG DevCorp announced its plan to separate the Company and SG DevCorp into separate publicly traded companies (the Separation ). To implement the Separation, on (the Distribution Date ), the Company, effected a pro rata distribution to its stockholders of approximately of the outstanding shares of SG DevCorp s common stock (the Distribution ). In connection with the Distribution, each Company stockholder received shares of SG DevCorp s common stock for every 5 shares of Company common stock held as of the close of business on , the record date for the Distribution, as well as a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares. Immediately after the Distribution, SG DevCorp was no longer a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company held approximately of SG DevCorp s issued and outstanding securities. On , SG DevCorp s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol . 
 
 In connection with the Separation and Distribution, SG DevCorp entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with the Company. These agreements provide for the allocation between SG DevCorp and the Company of the assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including, among others, investments, property, employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) of the Company and its subsidiaries attributable to periods prior to, at and after the Separation and will govern the relationship between the Company and SG DevCorp subsequent to the completion of the Separation. In addition to the separation and distribution agreement, the other principal agreements entered into with the Company included a tax matters agreement and a shared services agreement. 
 
 During 2024 , the Company s ownership in SG DevCorp fell below , and the Company deconsolidated SG DevCorp from its financial statements (the Deconsolidation ). The decrease in ownership percentage resulted from additional equity transactions of SG DevCorp. As of September 30, 2024, the Company accounts for its investment in SG DevCorp on the equity method. Upon deconsolidation, the Company recognized a gain of which resulted from the difference between the fair value of the Company s investment upon deconsolidation, and the net assets and carrying value of the non-controlling interest. The gain is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations. The fair value of the Company s investment in SG DevCorp upon deconsolidation amounted to . The Deconsolidation represents a strategic shift in the Company s operations and will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. Prior year financial statements for 2023 have been restated to present the operations of SG DevCorp as a discontinued operation. This transaction is further described in Note 19 and 20 .

Total Backlog 

The Company has incurred losses since its inception, has negative working capital of as of September 30, 2024 and has negative operating cash flows, which has raised substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty concerning the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The Company intends to meet its capital needs from revenue generated from operations and by containing costs, entering into strategic alliances, as well as exploring other options, including the possibility of raising additional debt or equity capital as necessary. There is, however, no assurance the Company will be successful in meeting its capital requirements prior to becoming cash flow positive. The Company does not have any additional sources secured for future funding, and if it is unable to raise the necessary capital at the times it requires such funding, it may need to materially change its business plan, including delaying implementation of aspects of such business plan or curtailing or abandoning such business plan altogether.

Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities 

Accounts receivable are recognized in the period when the Company s right to consideration is unconditional. Accounts receivable are recognized net of an allowance for credit losses. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of realization of receivables. 
 
 The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. 
 
 Contract assets include unbilled amounts from long-term construction services when revenue recognized under the cost-to-cost measure of progress exceeds the amounts invoiced to customers, as the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of the Company s contracts. Such amounts are recoverable from customers based upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones, completion of specified units or completion of a contract. Contract assets are generally classified as current within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Contract liabilities from construction and engineering contracts occur when amounts invoiced to customers exceed revenues recognized under the cost-to-cost measure of progress. Contract liabilities additionally include advanced payments from customers on certain contracts. Contract liabilities decrease as the Company recognizes revenue from the satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Contract liabilities are generally classified as current within the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 A lthough the Company believes it has established adequate procedures for estimating costs to complete on open contracts, it is at least reasonably possible that additional significant costs could occur on contracts prior to completion. The Company periodically evaluates and revises its estimates and makes adjustments when they are considered necessary. 

restricted shares of the Company s common stock over a defined vesting period starting in December 1, 2020. The restricted shares of the Company's common stock were not issued to Clarity Labs as certain capital commitments were not met. Clarity Labs is a licensed clinical laboratory that uses specialized molecular testing equipment and that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of critical diseases, including COVID- 19 . Clarity Labs was also engaged in the business of manufacturing, importing and distributing various medical tests. Under the JV, the Company and Clarity Labs were to jointly market, sell, and distribute certain products and services Clarity Mobile Venture ). The Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary of Clarity Mobile Venture and has thus consolidated the activities in its consolidated financial statements. Due to the ongoing lower affects of COVID- 19 restrictions, the JV was wound down during the fourth quarter of 2022 . 
 
 On January 18, 2021, the Company entered into an operating agreement to form CAT. The purpose of CAT is to market , sell, distribute, lease and otherwise commercially exploit certain products and services in the COVID- 19 testing and other medical industry. The Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary of CAT and has thus consolidated the activities in its consolidated financial statements.

Overview 
 We operate in the following four segments: (i) construction; (ii) medical; (ii) real estate development; and (iv) environmental. The construction segment designs and constructs modular structures built in our factories using raw materials that are Made-in-America. In the medical segment we use our modular technology to offer turnkey solutions to medical testing and treatment and generating revenue from medical testing. Our real estate development segment builds innovative and green single or multifamily projects in underserved regions nationally using modules built in one of our vertically integrated factories. The environmental segment, the newest segment, is a sustainable medical and waste management solution that has a patented technology to collect waste and treat waste for safe disposal. 
 We are a provider of modular facilities Modules ). We currently provide Modules made out of both code-engineered cargo shipping containers and wood for use as both permanent or temporary structures for residential housing use and commercial use, including for health care facilities. Prior to the COVID- 19 pandemic, the Modules we supplied were primarily for retail, restaurant and military use and were manufactured by third party suppliers using our proprietary technology and design and engineering expertise, which modifies code-engineered cargo shipping containers and purpose-built modules for use for safe and sustainable commercial, industrial and residential building. Since our acquisition in September 2020 of Echo DCL, LLC Echo ), one of our key supply chain providers, we now have more control over the manufacturing process and have increased our product offerings to add Modules made out of wood. In March 2020, in response to the COVID- 19 pandemic we began increasing our focus on providing our Modules as health care facilities for deployable medical response solutions. In February 2023, we entered into an agreement with The Peoples Health Care, in Glendale, California, working in conjunction with Teamsters Local 848 , to deliver four Modules to provide medical services to union members. In March 2023, we formed Safe Green Medical Corporation to focus on our medical segment with an objective to establish a national presence with various clinics and labs that cater to the specific needs of local communities. During 2021 , through our subsidiary, Safe and Green Development Corporation. SG DevCorp ), we also began to focus on acquiring property to build multi-family housing communities that allows us to utilize the manufacturing services of Echo. SG Environmental Solutions Corp. SG Environmental ), formed in Delaware is focused on biomedical waste removal and will utilize a patented technology that it licenses to shred and disinfect biomedical waste, rendering the waste disinfected, unrecognizable, and of no greater risk to the public health than residential household waste. 
 
 SG DevCorp develops, co-develops builds and finances single and multi-family homes in underserved regions nationally using modules built in one of our vertically integrated factories. SG DevCorp has a minority interest in Norman Berry II Owners LLC and JDI-Cumberland Inlet LLC. 
 During 2024 , the Company s ownership in SG DevCorp fell below 50 , and the Company deconsolidated SG DevCorp from its financial statements (the Deconsolidation ).

 Payroll and related expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 3,507,118 compared to 5,419,852 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in the vesting of restricted stock units during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior period, as well as the deconsolidation of SG DevCorp during 2024 . 
 
 Other operating expenses (general and administrative expenses and marketing and business development expenses) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,829,370 compared to 4,052,957 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

Impact of Inflation 
 
 Inflation has caused increases on some of the Company's estimated costs for construction projects in progress and completed during the past two fiscal years, which has affected the Company's revenue and income (loss) from continuing operations. 
 Our operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 may not be indicative of our future operations. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had an aggregate of 256,957 and 14,212 , respectively, of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
 Historically, our operations have primarily been funded through proceeds from equity and debt financings, as well as revenue from operations. 
 We have negative operating cash flows, which has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are issued. 
 We intend to meet our capital needs from revenue generated from operations and by containing costs, entering into strategic alliances, as well as exploring other options, including the possibility of raising additional debt or equity capital as necessary. There is, however, no assurance we will be successful in meeting our capital requirements prior to becoming cash flow positive. We do not have any additional sources secured for future funding, and if we are unable to raise the necessary capital at the times we require such funding, we may need to materially change our business plan, including delaying implementation of aspects of such business plan or curtailing or abandoning such business plan altogether .

Cedar is expected to withdraw 49,150 a week directly from SG Building until the 1,957,150 due to Cedar is paid in full. In the event of a default (as defined in the Fifth Cedar Cash Advance Agreement), Cedar, among other remedies, can demand payment in full of all amounts remaining due under the Fifth Cash Advance Agreement. SG Building s obligations under the Fifth Cash Advance Agreement have been guaranteed by SG Echo, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

We continue to generate losses from operations. As of September 30, 2024 , our stockholders equity was 8,158,927 , compared to 6,334,859 as of December 31, 2023, and we had an accumulated deficit of 84,303,865 , compared to 75,930,805 as of December 31, 2023. Our net loss attributable to our common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11,511,655 and net cash used in operating activities was 9,915,916 . 
 We will need to generate additional revenues or secure additional financing sources, such as debt or equity capital, to fund future growth, which financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all. We are in the process of securing funding, which we believe will provide the needed working capital until we are cash flow positive, which we believe will be in [the second half of 2024 ]. If we are unable to raise the necessary capital at the times we require such funding, we may need to materially change our business plan, including delaying implementation of aspects of such business plan or curtailing or abandoning such business plan altogether.

There can be no assurance that our customers will decide to and/or be able to proceed with these construction projects, or that we will ultimately recognize revenue from these projects in a timely manner or at all. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements to which we are a party. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions which, in our judgment, are normal and customary for companies in our industry sector. These agreements are typically with consultants and certain vendors. Pursuant to these agreements, we generally agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to actions taken or omitted by us. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. We have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ). In connection with the preparation of the financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that we believe to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 
 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. 
 
 Share-based payments . We measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, including non-employee directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date. For non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on interim financial reporting dates and vesting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a graded-vesting basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of each award. Stock-based compensation expense to employees and all directors is reported within payroll and related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Stock-based compensation expense to non-employees is reported within marketing and business development expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Other derivative financial instruments. We classify as equity any contracts that (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (ii) provide a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in our own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement), provided that such contracts are indexed to our own stock. We classify as assets or liabilities any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if any event occurs and if that event is outside SGB s control) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement shares (physical settlement or net-cash settlement). SGB assesses classification of common stock purchase warrants and other free-standing derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between assets and liabilities or equity is required 
 
 Convertible instruments . We bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (i) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract; (ii) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable GAAP measures with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur; and (iii) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. 
 
 We determined that the embedded conversion options that were included in the previously outstanding convertible debentures should be bifurcated from their host and a portion of the proceeds received upon the issuance of the hybrid contract has been allocated to the fair value of the derivative. The derivative was subsequently marked to market at each reporting date based on current fair value, with the changes in fair value reported in results of operations. 

55 

Critical Accounting Estimates (continued) 
 Revenue recognition We determine, at contract inception, whether we will transfer control of a promised good or service over time or at a point in time, regardless of the length of contract or other factors. The recognition of revenue aligns with the timing of when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps in accordance with its revenue policy: 
 
 1 Identify the contract with a customer 
 
 2 Identify the performance obligations in the contract 
 
 3 Determine the transaction price 
 
 4 Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract 
 
 5 Recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied 
 
 On certain contracts, the Company applies recognition of revenue over time, which is similar to the method the Company applied under previous guidance (i.e. percentage of completion). Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that estimates of costs to complete a performance obligation will be revised in the near-term. For those performance obligations for which revenue is recognized using a cost-to-cost input method, changes in total estimated costs, and related progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions to the estimates are made. When the current estimate of total costs for a performance obligation indicate a loss, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the unsatisfied performance obligation is made in the period in which the loss becomes evident. 
 
 Goodwill The Company performs its impairment test of goodwill at the reporting unit level each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of its reporting unit below its carrying values. The Company performs a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill. The amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss. There were no impairments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 . 
 Intangible assets Intangible assets consist of 68,344 of trademarks, and 6,706 of website costs that are being amortized over 5 years. The Company evaluated intangible assets for impairment during the year ended December 31, 2023 and determined that there was an 1,880,547 impairment loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 relating to intangible assets of proprietary knowledge and technology. The amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1 0,251 and 14 0,437 , respectively. The accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 59,975 and 2,852,929 , respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 
 In addition to our results under GAAP, we also present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for historical periods. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and have been presented as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We calculate EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, income tax benefit (expense), depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before certain non-recurring, unusual or non-operational items, such as litigation expense, stock issuance expense and stock compensation expense. We believe that adjusting EBITDA to exclude the effects of these items that are not closely associated with ongoing corporate operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases period-to -period comparability of our operating performance. 
 We believe the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful by enhancing the readers ability to understand the Company s operating performance. Our management utilizes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a means to measure performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. These measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, provide investors with an additional financial analytical framework that may be useful in assessing us and our results of operations. 
 Our measurements of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar titled measures reported by other companies. Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use such measures or may calculate one or more of the measures differently than as presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, or any other measures of financial performance derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not consider these non-GAAP measures to be substitutes for or superior to the information provided by our GAAP financial results. . The non-GAAP information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. 
 
 These measures also should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the non-recurring, unusual or non-operational items for which these non-GAAP measures make adjustments. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be liquidity measures.

ITEM 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not required. 
 
 ITEM 4 . Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management of Safe Green Holdings Corp., with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act, Rules 13 a- 15 (e) or 15 d- 15 (e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 The Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 For the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 , there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluations required by Rule 13 a- 15 (d) or Rule 15 d- 15 (d) under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not ex pect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

P ART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1 . Legal Proceedings 

The information included in "Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies" of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report Form 10-Q is incorporated by reference into this Item. 
 
 ITEM 1 A. Risk Factors 

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks, together with all other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the following risks actually materializes, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1 A, "Risk Factors," contained in the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part I Item 1 A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K, except as follows: 
 
 If we are not successful in our efforts to increase sales or raise capital, we could experience a shortfall in cash over the next twelve months, and our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all, may be limited. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had cash and cash equivalents and a short-term investment, collectively, of 256,957 and 14,212 respectively. However, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of Safe Green Holdings Corp. of 11,511,655 and 12,683,098 , respectively, and used 9,915,916 and 4,671,863 of cash for operations, respectively. If we are not successful with our efforts to increase revenue, we could experience a shortfall in cash over the next twelve months. If there is a shortfall, we may be forced to reduce operating expenses, among other steps, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our operations going forward. 
 
 We may also seek to obtain debt or additional equity financing to meet any cash shortfalls. The type, timing and terms of any financing we may select will depend on, among other things, our cash needs, the availability of other financing sources and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funds if needed and that, if such funds are available, the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us. In addition, our inability to currently utilize a short form registration statement on Form S-3 may impair our ability to obtain capital in a timely fashion. If we are unable to secure additional financing, further reduction in operating expenses might need to be substantial in order for us to ensure enough liquidity to sustain our operations. Any equity financing would be dilutive to our stockholders. If we incur debt, we will likely be subject to restrictive covenants that significantly limit our operating flexibility and require us to encumber our assets. If we fail to raise sufficient funds and continue to incur losses, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of strategic opportunities, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures will be significantly limited. Any of the above limitations could force us to significantly curtail or cease our operations, and you could lose all of your investment in our common stock. These circumstances have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and continued cash losses may risk our status as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern . 
 
 The report of our independent registered public accounting firm contains a note stating that the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had cash and cash equivalents and a short-term investment, collectively, of 256,957 and 14,212 , respectively. However, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of Safe Green Holdings Corp. of 11,511,655 and 12,683,098 ), respectively, and used 9,915,916 and 4,671,863 of cash for operations, respectively. 
 
 We have incurred losses since inception, have negative working capital of 11,237,131 as of September 30, 2024 and have negative operating cash flows, which has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect our current cash and the proceeds from anticipated financings to be sufficient for working capital until we are cash flow positive, which we believe will be in the first half of 2025 . 
 
 The loss of one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 A few customers have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 approximately 84 of our revenue was generated from one customer and for the year ended December 31, 2023 , approximately 87 of our revenue was generated from one customers. Although we have contractual relationships with many of our significant customers, our customers may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their contracts with us at any time. The loss of business from a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

59 

Our clients may adjust, cancel or suspend the contracts in our backlog; as such, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. In addition, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins. 
 
 Backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts we have been awarded. Backlog may fluctuate significantly due to the timing of orders or awards for large projects and is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which backlog will be recognized as revenue. We include in backlog only those contracts for which we have reasonable assurance that the customer can obtain the permits for construction and can fund the construction. As of December 31, 2023, our backlog totaled approximately 1.9 million and as of September 30, 2024 , our backlog totaled approximately 1.9 million. Our backlog is described more in detail in Note 13 Construction Backlog of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We cannot provide assurance that our backlog will be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination or suspension at our customer s discretion. In the event of a project cancellation, we generally would not have a contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. Projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. In addition, the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices. 
 The contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided and adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. The revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates. Additionally, our performance of our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and, therefore, our future profitability. We can provide no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce revenues in the amounts currently estimated, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past. 
 
 The issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options, warrants and restricted stock units may dilute the percentage ownership of the then-existing stockholders and may make it more difficult to raise additional equity capital. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , there were options, restricted stock units and warrants of 1,822 , 12,406 and 4,008,411, respectively, outstanding that could potentially dilute future net income per share. Because the Company had a net loss as of September 30, 2024 , it is prohibited from including potential common shares in the computation of diluted per share amounts. Accordingly, the Company has used the same number of shares outstanding to calculate both the basic and diluted loss per share. At September 30, 2023 , there were no restricted stock units and options and warrants of 1,822 and 126,251 , respectively, outstanding that could potentially dilute future net income per share. 
 
 If SG DevCorp were to default in its obligation to repay the loan received from BCV S G it could adversely affect our investment in SG DevCorp. 
 To date, SG DevCorp has received 1,750,000 as a secured loan from BCV S G, a Luxembourg-based specialized investment fund, and has entered into a loan agreement with BCV S G DevCorp to receive up to 2,000,000 as a secured loan. The loan matures on December 1, 2024 and is secured by 1,999,999 of our shares of SG DevCorp s common stock. The loan agreement, as amended, provides that if SG DevCorp s shares of common stock were not listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market before September 30, 2023 or if following such listing the total market value of the pledged shares falls below twice the face value of the loan, the loan would be further secured by SG DevCorp s St. Mary s industrial site. Following the listing, the total market value of the pledged shares has fallen below twice the face value of the loan and SG DevCorp and BCV S G are in discussions regarding alternatives. If SG DevCorp were to default in its obligation to repay the loan when due it could adversely affect our investment in SG DevCorp. 
 Changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, domestic and foreign trade policies, monetary policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results. 
 The uncertain financial markets, disruptions in supply chains, mobility restraints, and changing priorities as well as volatile asset value s also affect our business operations and our ability to enter into collaborations and joint ventures. To date, i nflation has caused increases on some of our estimated costs for construction projects in progress and completed during the past two fiscal years, which has affected our revenue and income(loss) from continuing operations. It is difficult to predict the impact on increasing inflation on our operations. We are actively monitoring the effects th ese disruptions and increasing inflation could have on our operations. 

60 

A number of other economic and geopolitical factors both in the U.S. and abroad, could ultimately have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including the following: 

effects of significant changes in economic, monetary and fiscal policies in the U.S. and abroad including currency fluctuations, inflationary pressures and significant income tax changes; 

supply chain disruptions; 

a global or regional economic slowdown in any of our market segments; 

changes in government policies and regulations affecting the Company or its significant customers; 

postponement of spending, in response to tighter credit, financial market volatility and other factors; 

rapid material escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and litigation; 

the effects of the war in the Middle East; 

longer payment cycles; 

credit risks and other challenges in collecting accounts receivable; and 

the impact of each of the foregoing on outsourcing and procurement arrangements. 

 F ailure to meet NASDAQ s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock, negatively impact the price of our common stock and negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital . 
 Our Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq or the Nasdaq Capital Market ), which imposes, among other requirements, a minimum bid requirement. On May 10, 2024, the Company received a letter (the Delisting Notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company that Nasdaq previously notified the Company on November 7, 2023 that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550 (a)( 2 ( Rule 5550 (a)( 2 ), which requires a minimum bid price of at least 1.00 per share for continued listing.On May 16, 2014, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating that for the period from May 2, 2024 to May 15, 2024, the closing bid price of the Company s common stock had been at 1.00 per share or greater, and accordingly the Company had regained compliance with Rule 5550 (a)( 2 ). However, the Company cannot provide assurances that it will be able to continue to comply with Rule 5550 (a)( 2 in the future. 
 On April 19, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying it that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250 (c)( 1 ( Rule 5250 (c)( 1 ), which requires companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC for continued listing. On May 13, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, based on the May 7, 2024 and May 10, 2024 filings of the Company s Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had regained compliance with Rule 5250 (c)( 1 ). However, the Company cannot provide assurances that it will be able to continue to comply with Rule 5250 (c)( 1 in the future. 
 On May 16, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550 (b)( 1 ( Rule 5550 (b)( 1 ) because the stockholders equity of the Company of 6,334,859 , as reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, was below the minimum requirement of 2.5 million. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company does not have a market value of listed securities of 35 million, or net income from continued operations of 500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years, the alternative quantitative standards for continued listing on Nasdaq. In accordance with Nasdaq s Listing Rules, the Company had until June 30, 2024 to submit a plan to regain compliance with Rule 5550 (b)( 1 ). On July 25, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that, based on its review of the Company and the materials submitted by the Company to Nasdaq, Nasdaq Staff determined to grant the Company an extension to regain compliance with Rule 5550 (b)( 1 until November 12, 2024, subject to the Company regaining and evidencing compliance with Rule 5550 (b)( 1 by such date. 
 The Company expects to regain compliance with Rule 5550 (b)( 1 as a result of the recent private placement, cost-cutting initiatives aimed at achieving positive cash flow in 2024 , ongoing debt reduction and other strategic initiatives; provided that there can be no assurances that such measures will be consummated or that they will achieve their intended effects. If the Company does not regain compliance with Rule 5550 (b)( 1 by November 12, 2024, Nasdaq will provide written notice that our common stock is subject to delisting. At such time, the Company would be entitled to appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearing Panel (the "Panel"). The hearing request would stay any suspension or delisting action pending the conclusion of the hearing process and expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. 
 
 Any delisting of the Company s common stock from Nasdaq, including as a result of its inability to regain compliance with Rule 5550 (b)( 1 ), could adversely affect the Company s ability to attract new investors, reduce the liquidity of its outstanding shares of common stock, reduce its ability to raise additional capital, reduce the price at which its common stock trades, result in negative publicity and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares with overall negative effects for the Company s stockholders. The Company cannot assure its investors that its common stock, if delisted from Nasdaq, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the-counter quotation system. In addition, delisting of the Company s common stock could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in the Company s common stock and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in the Company s securities at all. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and liquidity.
