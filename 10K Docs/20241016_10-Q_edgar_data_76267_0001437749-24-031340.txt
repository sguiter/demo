 (Unaudited) 

 (Amounts in thousands, except share (unless otherwise stated), per share and option amounts) 

The fair value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying value due to their short-term nature. Certain assets and liabilities of the Company are required to be recorded at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis. On a recurring basis, the Company records its marketable securities at fair value using Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. (See Note 3) 

The Company s non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include goodwill and any long-lived assets written down to fair value. To measure fair value of such assets, the Company uses Level 3 inputs consisting of techniques including an income approach and a market approach. The income approach is based on a discounted cash flow analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, terminal values, growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. With respect to goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value. If, based on that assessment, the Company believes it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value, a goodwill impairment test is performed. There have been no changes in events or circumstances which required impairment charges to be recorded during the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024.

Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Company s condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. 

For the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, the Company s operating lease expenses were and , respectively. Cash payments of , pertaining to operating leases, are reflected in the cash flow statement under cash flows from operating activities.

shares of common stock of the Company. Prior to the 2018 Plan, the Company had the 2002 Stock Option Plan (the 2002 Plan which had been approved by the Company s shareholders and provided for the grant of stock options to directors and key employees of the Company. All options granted under the 2018 Plan and 2002 Plan have exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock of the Company at the time of grant which, pursuant to the terms of such Plans, is the reported closing price of the common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date preceding the date the option is granted. Options granted under the Plans become exercisable one year after the date of grant, with an additional exercisable each succeeding anniversary of the date of grant, and expire years after the date of grant. Upon termination of employment or service as a director, all options held by the optionee that have not previously become exercisable shall terminate and all other options held by such optionee may be exercised, to the extent exercisable on the date of such termination, for a limited time after such termination. Any shares of common stock subject to an option under the 2018 Plan, which expires or is terminated unexercised as to such shares, shall again become available for issuance under the 2018 Plan. 

During the 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, the Company granted options under the 2018 Plan to purchase a total of shares of common stock to its directors and certain of its employees. The future compensation expense to be recognized in earnings before income taxes is and will be recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The weighted average fair value of the granted options was per share using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of - ; expected volatility factor of - ; expected dividend yield of ; and estimated option term of - years. 

The risk-free interest rates were based on U.S. Treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the estimated terms of the options at the date of the grant. Volatility factors were based on historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The expected dividend yields were based on the regular quarterly cash dividend per share most recently declared by the Company and on the exercise price of the options granted during the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024. The estimated term of the options was based on evaluations of the historical and expected future employee exercise behavior. 

During the 2024 fiscal year, the Company recorded non-cash charges of related to the modification of previously granted employee stock options resulting from the per share special cash dividend paid by the Company in April 2023. 

The future compensation expense to be recognized in earnings before income taxes for options outstanding at September 1, 2024 was , which is expected to be recognized ratably over a weighted average vesting period of years.

The Company purchased and shares of its common stock during the 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 and August 27, 2023, respectively. As a result, the Company is authorized to purchase up to a total of shares of its common stock, representing approximately of the Company s total outstanding shares as of the close of business on October 7, 2024. There is no assurance the Company will purchase any shares pursuant to this Board of Directors authorization. Shares purchased by the Company, if any, will be retained as treasury stock and will be available for use under the Company s stock option plan and for other corporate purposes.

The Company s effective tax rates for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 were income tax provisions of and , respectively, compared to income tax provisions of and in the comparable prior periods. The effective tax rates for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 were higher than the U.S. statutory rate of primarily due to state and local taxes and a discrete income tax provision for the accrual of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. The effective rates for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023 were higher than the U.S. statutory rate of primarily due to state and local taxes and discrete income tax provisions for the accrual of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. 

Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of the deemed repatriated earnings as a result of the mandatory one-time transition tax on the accumulated untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. shareholders included in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company intends to indefinitely invest approximately million of undistributed earnings outside of the U.S. If these future earnings are repatriated to the U.S., or if the Company determines such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, the Company may be required to accrue U.S. deferred taxes on such earnings.

and , respectively, for storm damage in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024. 

On May 19, 2024, the Company s manufacturing facilities in Newton, Kansas were damaged by a strong storm which transitioned the area. None of the Company s manufacturing lines or equipment were damaged by the storm. Although the building structures are secure, the roofs on all three buildings in the Company s Newton, Kansas campus will ultimately need to be replaced. Also, multiple specialty HVAC units were damaged or destroyed. These specialty HVAC units are necessary to control the temperature and humidity in certain manufacturing areas, quality laboratories and R D laboratories, which is required by certain specifications and certifications the Company is subject to. The Company is currently working with multiple contractors on site to remediate the damage. 

Although the Company is still in the process of remediating the damage, the Company s production lines were returned to full production within two weeks of the storm. The Company is employing certain temporary measures in order to return its production lines to full service, including the use of temporary HVAC equipment, but it will take the Company several months to permanently repair or replace all of the damaged facilities and infrastructure equipment. 

The Company does not anticipate the loss of any sales for the 2025 fiscal year. 

The Company paid its employees for the days immediately following the storm despite many not being able to work while others worked on the clean-up of the storm damage to the facilities. The Company incurred of payroll and related costs for lost production time and employees working on clean-up. 

The charge recorded by the Company includes an asset damage charge, emergency services by outside contractors, rental of temporary HVAC units and the cost of employee downtime or time spent on the clean-up of the storm damage to the facilities. Additional costs will be recorded in future periods as additional work is needed and performed. 

The Company has insurance coverage for wind damage with a deductible of approximately million. Under the insurance policy, the Company expects to recover all costs and damages incurred in excess of the deductible. The costs will be in part based on replacement costs, which will be in excess of the charge. Any insurance recovery will be recorded when realization can be determined and is assured. 

Environmental Contingencies 

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA or a comparable state agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the Superfund Act or similar state law as potentially responsible parties in connection with alleged releases of hazardous substances at three sites. 

Under the Superfund Act and similar state laws, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste disposal site or contaminated area identified by the EPA or comparable state agency may be jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup. Generally, these sites are locations at which numerous persons disposed of hazardous waste. In the case of the Company s subsidiaries, generally the waste was removed from their manufacturing facilities and disposed at waste sites by various companies which contracted with the subsidiaries to provide waste disposal services. Neither the Company nor any of its sub sidiaries have been accused of or charged with any wrongdoing or illegal acts in connection with any such sites. The Company believes it maintains an effective and comprehensive environmental compliance program. 

The insurance carriers which provided general liability insurance coverage to the Company and its subsidiaries for the years during which the Company s subsidiaries waste was disposed at these three sites have in the past reimbursed the Company and its subsidiaries for of their legal defense and remediation costs associated with two of these sites. 

The Company does not record environmental liabilities and related legal expenses for which the Company believes that it and its subsidiaries have general liability insurance coverage for the years during which the Company s subsidiaries waste was disposed at two sites for which certain subsidiaries of the Company have been named as potentially responsible parties. Pursuant to such general liability insurance coverage, three insurance carriers reimburse the Company and its subsidiaries for 100 of the legal defense and remediation costs associated with the two sites. 

Included in selling, general and administrative expenses are charges for actual expenditures and accruals, based on estimates, for certain environmental mat ters described above. The Company accrues estimated costs asso ciated with known environmental matters when such costs can be reasonably estimated and when the outcome appears probable. The Company believes that the ultimate disposition of known environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Financial Overview 

On May 19, 2024, the Company s manufacturing facilities in Newton, Kansas were damaged by a strong storm which transitioned the area. None of the Company s manufacturing lines or equipment were damaged by the storm. Although the building structures are secure, the roofs on two of the three buildings in the Company s Newton, Kansas campus will need significant repairs and the roof on one building will need to be replaced. Also, multiple specialty HVAC units were damaged or destroyed. These specialty HVAC units are necessary to control the temperature and humidity in certain manufacturing areas, quality laboratories and R D laboratories, as required by certain specifications and certifications the Company is subject to. The Company is currently working with multiple contractors on site to remediate the damage. 

Although the Company is still in the process of remediating the damage, the Company s production lines are all fully operational. The Company is employing certain temporary measures in order to keep its production lines operating at full service, including the use of temporary HVAC equipment, but it will take the Company several months to permanently repair or replace all the damaged facilities and infrastructure equipment. The Company has recorded a charge of 1.1 million in the 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 related to the damage and related repair and downtime costs. 

The Company's net sales in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 were 16.7 million and 30.7 million, respectively, compared to 12.5 million and 28.0 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023. Sales for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 were higher than in the comparable periods of the prior fiscal year due to higher sales to the commercial aerospace and military markets. 

18

The Company s gross profit in the 13 weeks ended September 1, 2024 was higher than the gross profit in the prior year s comparable period due to higher sales levels in the 13 weeks ended September 1, 2024 compared to the comparable period in the prior year partially offset by a less favorable product mix, higher depreciation, repairs and maintenance and utilities related to the use of a new production line, and higher costs for raw materials, supplies, freight and labor resulting from inflationary trends. The Company s gross profit in the 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 was similar to the gross profit in the prior year s comparable period despite higher sales levels primarily due to a less favorable sales mix and the higher costs mentioned above. 

The Company s gross profit margins, measured as percentages of sales, were 28.5 and 28.9 , respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 compared to 32.7 and 31.8 , respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023. The lower gross profit margins for the 13 and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 compared to the prior year s comparable periods were primarily due to ramping up capacity ahead of customer program volume increases, a less favorable sales mix due to fabric sales, higher depreciation, repairs and maintenance and utilities related to use of the new production line, and higher costs for raw materials, supplies, freight and labor resulting from inflationary trends, partially offset by higher sales. 

The Company s earnings before income taxes and net earnings increased 19.1 and 18.3 , respectively, in the 13 weeks ended September 1, 2024, compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2023, primarily as a result of higher sales, partially offset by an unfavorable sales mix due to higher fabric sales and the higher costs mentioned above. 

The Company s earnings before income taxes and net earnings decreased 14.7 and 15.0 , respectively, in the 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, compared to the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023, primarily as a result of charges incurred related to the storm damage and the higher costs mentioned above, partially offset by higher sales. 

The Company continues to experience inflation in costs of raw materials and supplies, freight costs and other costs and expenses. The impact of inflation on the Company s profits has been partially mitigated by the Company s ability to adjust pricing for a large portion of its sales to pass the impact of inflation through to its customers. 

Programs in which the Company participates as a supplier are, in some cases, experiencing supply chain issues from other suppliers to the programs that could result in delays in production for certain customers of the Company. The Company s sales may be impacted by these supply chain challenges its customers are experiencing from other suppliers. 

While the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have had a negative impact on the Company s results of operations due to delayed shipments, the Company may experience an increase in future sales due to increases in spending worldwide on missile defense systems and other defense programs. The Company does not have any significant customers in Russia or Ukraine but does have customers in Israel. The Company has experienced some increases in raw material costs from overseas suppliers due to the impacts of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. 

The Company has a long-term contract pursuant to which one of its customers, which represents a substantial portion of the Company s revenue, places orders. The long-term contract with the customer is requirements based and does not guarantee quantities. An order forecast and pricing were agreed upon in the contract. However, this order forecast is updated periodically during the term of the contract. Purchase orders generally are received by the Company in excess of three months in advance of delivery by the Company to the customer.

Net Sales 

The Company's net sales in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, were 16.7 million and 30.7 million, respectively, compared to 12.5 million and 28.0 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023. Sales for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 were higher than the comparable periods of the prior year, primarily due to higher sales to the commercial aerospace and military markets. 

Gross Profit 

The Company s gross profit in the 13 weeks ended September 1, 2024 was higher than the gross profit in the prior year s comparable period due to higher sales levels in the 13 weeks ended September 1, 2024, compared to the comparable period in the prior year partially offset by a less favorable product mix, due to higher fabric sales, higher depreciation, repairs and maintenance and utilities related to use of the new production line, and higher costs for raw materials, supplies, freight and labor resulting from inflationary trends. The Company s gross profit in the 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 was similar to the gross profit in the prior year s comparable period despite higher sales levels primarily due to a less favorable sales mix, due to higher fabric sales, and the higher costs mentioned above. 

The Company s gross profit margins, measured as a percentage of sales, were 28.5 and 28.9 , respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, compared to 32.7 and 31.8 , respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023. The lower gross profit margins for the 13 and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, compared to the prior year s comparable periods were primarily due to ramping up capacity ahead of customer program volume increases, to a less favorable sales mix, due to higher fabric sales, higher depreciation, repairs and maintenance and utilities related to the use of the new production line, and higher costs for raw materials, supplies, freight and labor resulting from inflationary trends, partially offset by higher sales. 

20

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 287,000 during the 13 weeks ended September 1, 2024, and increased by 15.5 compared to the prior year s comparable period, and these expenses, measured as percentages of sales, were 12.8 in the 13 weeks ended September 1, 2024 compared to 14.8 in the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses during the 13 weeks ended September 1, 2024 was primarily due to freight out, advertising and tradeshow expense, higher salaries and payroll related expenses and higher profit sharing expense mainly due to higher headcount in connection with ramping up capacity in preparation of increases in customer program volumes. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 311,000 during the 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, and decreased by 7.0 compared to the prior year s comparable period, and these expenses, measured as a percentage of sales, were 13.5 in the 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 compared to 15.9 in the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses during the 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 was primarily due to 570,000 of activist shareholder defense costs in the prior year comparable period. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses included stock option expenses of 101,000 and 190,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, compared to stock option expenses of 104,000 and 322,000, including 109,000 due to the modification of previously granted stock options, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023. 

Earnings from Operations 

For the reasons set forth above, the Company s earnings from operations were 2.6 million and 4.7 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, compared to 2.2 million and 4.4 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023. 

Interest and Other Income 

Interest and other income were 245,000 and 584,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, compared to 139,000 and 463,000, respectively, for the prior year's comparable periods. Interest income increased 76.3 and 26.1 , respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, primarily as a result of higher weighted average interest rates and lower losses on the sales of marketable securities, compared to the prior year's comparable periods. During the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, the Company earned interest income principally from its investments, which consisted primarily of short-term instruments and money market funds. 

Income Tax Provision 

For the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, the Company recorded income tax provisions of 750,000 and 1.1 million, respectively, which included discrete income tax provisions of 22,000 and 41,000, respectively, for the accrual of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. For the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023, the Company recorded income tax provisions of 619,000 and 1.3 million, respectively, which included discrete income tax provisions of 16,000 and 53,000, respectively, for the accrual of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. 

21

The Company s effective tax rates for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 were 26.6 and 26.9 , respectively, compared to 26.2 and 26.6 , respectively, in the prior year s comparable periods. The effective tax rates for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 were higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to state and local taxes and liabilities and the accrual of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. The effective rates for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023 were higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to state and local taxes and the accrual of interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. 

Net Earnings 

For the reasons set forth above, the Company's net earnings for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024 were 2.1 million and 3.1 million, respectively, compared to net earnings of 1.7 million and 3.6 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023. 

Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share 

In the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, basic and diluted earnings per share were 0.10 and 0.15, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of 0.09 and 0.18, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023.

Cash and Marketable Securities 

Of the 72.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 1, 2024, 30.4 million was owned by one of the Company s wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries. 

22

The change in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 1, 2024 compared to March 3, 2024 was the result of capital expenditures, the purchase of treasury shares, dividends paid to shareholders, the Company s transition tax installment payment, and a number of additional factors. The significant changes in cash provided by (used in) operating activities was as follows: 

accounts receivable decreased by 12 at September 1, 2024 compared to March 3, 2024 primarily due to timing of sales; 

inventories increased by 19 at September 1, 2024 compared to March 3, 2024 primarily due to timing of raw materials purchases; 

prepaid and other current assets decreased by 12 at September 1, 2024 compared to March 3, 2024 primarily due to lower prepaid tax balances; 

accounts payable increased by 5 at September 1, 2024 compared to March 3, 2024 primarily due to timing of vendor payments; 

accrued liabilities decreased by 32 at September 1, 2024 compared to March 3, 2024 primarily due to decreases in bonus, profit sharing, and property tax accruals; and 

income taxes payable decreased by 45 at September 1, 2024 compared to March 3, 2024 due to the payment of a 4.2 million transition tax installment payment in June 2024. 

In addition, the Company paid 5.1 million in cash dividends in the 26-week period ended September 1, 2024 compared to 25.6 million in the 26-week period ended August 27, 2023. The amount paid during the 26-week period ended August 27, 2023 included a 20.5 million special dividend. 

Working Capital 

The decrease in working capital at September 1, 2024 compared to March 3, 2024 was due principally to the decreases in marketable securities, accounts receivable and prepaid and other current assets and increased income taxes payable, partially offset by an increase in inventories and decreases in accrued liabilities. 

The Company's current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 9.1 to 1.0 at September 1, 2024, compared to 10.2 to 1.0 at March 3, 2024. 

Cash Flows 

During the 26 weeks ended September 1, 2024, the Company's net earnings, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, amortization of bond premium and changes in operating assets and liabilities, resulted in a 1.0 million operating cash inflow. During the same 26-week period, the Company expended 206,000 for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, compared with 374,000 during the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2023. The Company paid 5.1 million in cash dividends in the 26-week period ended September 1, 2024, compared to 25.6 million in the 26-week period ended August 27, 2023. The Company purchased treasury shares of 1.9 million in the 26-week period ended September 1, 2024 compared to 2.9 million in the 26-week period ended August 27, 2023. 

23

Other Liquidity Factors 

The Company believes its financial resources will be sufficient, through the 12 months following the filing of this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report and for the foreseeable future thereafter, to provide for continued investment in working capital and property, plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes. The Company s financial resources are also available for purchases of the Company's common stock, cash dividend payments, and appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the Company's business. 

The Company is not aware of any circumstances or events that are reasonably likely to occur that could materially affect its liquidity. The Company further believes its balance sheet and financial position to be very strong. 

Contractual Obligations: 

The Company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as lease agreements, consist only of (i) operating lease commitments and (ii) commitments to purchase raw materials. The Company has no other long-term debt, capital lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations or other long-term obligations, standby letters of credit, guarantees, standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments, other than two standby letters of credit in the total amount of 140,000, to secure the Company s obligations under its workers compensation insurance program. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: 

The Company s liquidity is not dependent on the use of, and the Company is not engaged in, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: 

The foregoing Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to sales allowances, allowances for credit losses, inventories, valuation of long-lived assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and employee benefit programs. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The Company s critical accounting policies that are important to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and that entail, to a significant extent, the use of estimates and assumptions and the application of management s judgment are described in Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 3, 2024. There have been no significant changes to such accounting policies during the 2025 fiscal year second quarter. 

Contingencies: 

The Company is subject to a small number of immaterial proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, employment, product and other matters. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.

Factors That May Affect Future Results . 

Certain portions of this report which do not relate to historical financial information may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company s expectations or from results which might be projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted by the Company in forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, general conditions in the aerospace industry, the Company s competitive position, the status of the Company s relationships with its customers, economic conditions in international markets, the cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and utilities, and the various factors set forth under the caption Factors That May Affect Future Results in Item 1 and in Item 1A Risk Factors of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 3, 2024. 

Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . 

The Company s market risk exposure at September 1, 2024 is consistent with, and not greater than, the types of market risk and amount of exposures presented in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 3, 2024. 

Item 4 . Controls and Procedures . 

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 1, 2024, the end of the quarterly fiscal period covered by this quarterly report. Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

There has not been any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 AMENDED AND RESTATED 2018 STOCK OPTION PLAN 

1. Purpose of the Plan. This Park Electrochemical Corp. 2018 Stock Option Plan (herein called the " Plan ") is designed to promote shareholder value by providing appropriate incentives to certain employees, including officers, of Park Electrochemical Corp., a New York corporation (the " Company "), and any of its present or future subsidiaries (" Subsidiaries "), and to offer an additional inducement in obtaining the services of employees, directors and consultants. The Plan provides for the grant of (i) incentive stock options (" Incentive Stock Options "), as contemplated by Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as now in effect or later amended or superseded (the " Code "), which Options shall be subject to the tax treatment described in Section 421 of the Code, and (ii) non-qualified stock options (" Non-Qualified Stock Options " and, together with Incentive Stock Options, the Options ). 

The Plan supersedes and replaces the Park Electrochemical Corp 2002 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the Prior Plan ), for options granted on or after the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined in Section 14) of this Plan. Options may not be granted under the Prior Plan beginning on the Effective Date, but the adoption and effectiveness of the Plan will not affect the terms or conditions of any outstanding options granted under the Prior Plan prior to the Effective Date, and the Prior Plan shall remain in effect with respect to all outstanding options granted under the Prior Plan until such options have been exercised, forfeited, canceled, expired or otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms of such options. At the Effective Date, none of the shares of Common Stock available under the Prior Plan shall be available under this Plan and none of the shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options granted under the Prior Plan shall again become available for issuance under this Plan, whether upon the expiration, termination, cancellation or forfeiture of such options or otherwise. 

2. Stock Subject to the Plan. Options may be granted under the Plan to purchase in the aggregate not more than 1,550,000 shares 1 of Common Stock, par value .10 per share, of the Company (" Common Stock "), which shares may, in the discretion of the board of directors of the Company (the Board ), consist either in whole or in part of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, and all of which are available for the grant of both Incentive Stock Options and Non-Qualified Stock Options. Subject to the provisions of Section 7 hereof, any shares of Common Stock subject to an Option which for any reason expires or is terminated unexercised as to such shares shall again become available for issuance under this Plan. 

3. Administration of the Plan. The Plan shall be administered by the Board or such committee as the Board may establish or designate from time to time (the " Committee "). The Committee shall be composed of one or more members each of whom shall, unless otherwise determined by the Board, be "non-employee directors, within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 (as amended or superseded) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The Committee shall have such powers and authorities related to the administration of the Plan as are consistent with the governing documents of the Company and applicable law. If the Board does not establish or designate a Committee to administer the Plan, all references herein to the Committee shall be deemed to be references to the Board. In addition, all references in the Plan to the authority, determinations or actions of the Committee shall be deemed to include the authority, determinations and actions of the Board as well as the Committee, including the right of the Committee to send any determination or action to the Board for review, approval and/or ratification by the Board. 

1 The only amendment in this Amended and Restated 2018 Stock Option Plan is the increase, as adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on June 13, 2024 and approved at the Company s 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on July 18, 2024, in the total number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan from 800,000 shares to 1,550,000 shares. 

Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to (i) determine the individuals to receive Options (each an Optionee ), (ii) determine the times when an Optionee shall receive an Option, (iii) determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be subject to each Option (except that no grants of Options may be made "in tandem, i.e., where an exercise of one Option, in whole or in part, automatically results in the lapse of termination of another Option, in whole or in part), (iv) determine whether and to what extent Options shall be designated Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options, (v) determine the amount of any required federal income tax or other withholding amount, (vi) determine the term of each Option, (vii) determine the date each Option shall become exercisable, (viii) determine whether an Option shall be exercisable in whole, in part or in installments, and if in installments, the number of shares subject to each installment, the date each installment shall become exercisable and the term of each installment, and whether to accelerate the date of exercise of any installment, (ix) amend, modify or supplement the terms of any Option that has been granted, (x) make any adjustments necessary or desirable as a result of the granting of Options to eligible individuals located outside the United States, (xi) determine the terms and conditions of each Option (including but not limited to, the Exercise Price (as hereinafter defined in Section 5), the nature and duration of any restriction or condition (or provision for the lapse thereof) relating to vesting (including performance conditions), exercise, transfer, suspension or forfeiture of an Option or the Common Stock subject thereto and the method or methods to be used for the same, and any terms or conditions that may be necessary to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option or to ensure exemption from or compliance with Section 409A of the Code, (xii) prescribe the form of the agreements evidencing Options granted under the Plan, (xiii) determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances, Options may be settled in cash, Common Stock, other securities or other property, and the method or methods by which Options may be settled, (xiv) permit or require the deferral of any gain attributable to the exercise of an Option into a deferred compensation arrangement, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code, where applicable, and such rules and procedures as it may establish, which may include provisions for the payment or crediting of interest or dividend equivalents, if any, including converting such interest or dividend equivalents into deferred Common Stock equivalents; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no deferral shall be allowed if the deferral opportunity would subject any Option, which would otherwise be excluded from Section 409A of the Code, to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and (xv) include as a condition to the receipt, exercise or settlement of an Option and the timing thereof, certain corporate and individual performance conditions, where such conditions may consist of one or more business criteria and a targeted level or levels of performance with respect to such criteria to be achieved during any performance period, and the length of such performance period; provided, that performance conditions may differ for Options granted to any one Optionee or different Optionees. 

The Committee is authorized to interpret the Plan and the Options granted under the Plan and the agreements evidencing such Options, to establish, amend and rescind any rules relating to the Plan, and to make any other determinations which it deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, modification or supplement of any outstanding Option shall, without the consent of the Optionee, impair the Optionee s rights under such outstanding Option, or subject any outstanding Option to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code that was exempt from such application as of the grant date. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Option or any agreement evidencing an Option in the manner and to the extent the Committee deems necessary or desirable to carry it into effect. Any decision of the Committee in the interpretation and administration of the Plan, as described herein, shall lie within its sole and absolute discretion and shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties concerned. The Committee may act only by a majority of its members in office, except that the members thereof may authorize any one or more of their members or any officer of the Company to execute and deliver documents or to take any other action on behalf of the Committee with respect to Options granted or to be granted to Optionees. 

2

No member of the Committee and no officer of the Company shall be liable for anything done or omitted to be done in good faith by such person, by any other member of the Committee or by any officer of the Company in connection with the performance of duties under the Plan, except for such person s own willful misconduct or as expressly provided by applicable law. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Committee and each officer of the Company to whom any duty or power relating to the administration or interpretation of the Plan may be allocated or delegated, against any cost or expense (including counsel fees) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim) arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with the Plan unless arising out of such person s own willful misconduct or bad faith; provided, however, that approval of the Board shall be required for the payment of any amount in settlement of a claim against any such person. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company s governing documents, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless. 

Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, an outstanding Option may not be amended to reduce the Exercise Price of such Option and an outstanding Option (with an Exercise Price greater than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock) may not be cancelled in exchange for cash or another Option with an Exercise Price that is less than the Exercise Price of the original Option, in each case, without the prior approval of the Company's shareholders, provided that appropriate adjustments may be made to outstanding Options pursuant to Section 10 hereof. 

The grant date for an Option under the Plan shall be the date on which the Committee approves a grant or such later date as may be specified by the Committee. 

4. Eligibility. The Committee may, consistent with the purposes of the Plan, grant Options from time to time within ten (10) years from the Effective Date, to (i) certain employees, including officers and directors who are employees, of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) directors of the Company who are not employees of the Company or any Subsidiary and (iii) consultants rendering services to the Company or any Subsidiary, covering such number of shares of Common Stock as the Committee may determine and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall from time to time determine in its sole discretion, subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan. 

The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of grant date of the Option) of the shares of Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options may be granted under this Plan and any other incentive stock options satisfying the requirements of Section 422 of the Code granted under any other plan of the Company or any Subsidiary (as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code) or of its parent (as defined in Section 424(e) of the Code) which are exercisable for the first time by any particular Optionee during any calendar year shall not exceed 100,000 for such Optionee. In addition, no Incentive Stock Option may be granted under the Plan if such grant, together with any other applicable grant of Incentive Stock Options under the Plan and any other incentive stock options satisfying the requirements of the Code granted under any other plan of the Company or any Subsidiary (as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code) or of its parent (as defined in Section 424(e) of the Code), would exceed any other applicable maximum established under the Code for incentive stock options. If an Option granted under the Plan exceeds the foregoing limitations, such Option shall be deemed a Non-Qualified Stock Option to the extent it exceeds such limitations. 

3

Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, commencing in the Company's fiscal year ending March 3, 2019, no individual may, in any such fiscal year, receive Options relating to Common Stock which in the aggregate exceed the greater of (i) 50 of the total number of shares of Common Stock granted pursuant to the Plan in any such year or (ii) 100,000 shares of Common Stock. Further, notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the aggregate Fair Market Value on the grant date (computed as of such grant date in accordance with applicable financial accounting rules) of all Options granted to any non-employee director of the Company during any single fiscal year shall not exceed 500,000; provided, however, that such limit shall not apply to any election of a non-employee director to receive an Option in lieu of all or a portion of any annual committee cash retainers or other similar cash-based payments. 

5. Exercise Price. The exercise price of the Common Stock under each Option shall be determined by the Committee, but shall in no event be less than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock at the grant date; provided, however, that if as of the grant date of an Incentive Stock Option, the grantee owns stock possessing more than 10 of the total combined voting power of all classes of the capital stock of the Company, of its present and future subsidiaries (as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code) or of a parent (as defined in Section 424(e) of the Code), the exercise price shall not be less than 110 of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock as of the grant date (the Exercise Price ). 

Fair Market Value shall mean the reported closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (or, if the Common Stock is not then listed on the New York Stock Exchange, on such other securities exchange on which the Common Stock may then be listed), on the date preceding the grant date, or if there is no reported sale of the Common Stock on that date, then on the last previous day on which such sale was reported; provided that, if the foregoing clause is inapplicable, Fair Market Value shall be determined by the Committee and provided that, with respect to Incentive Stock Options, if such method is inconsistent with any regulations applicable to such Options adopted by the U.S. Department of Treasury, then the Fair Market Value shall be determined by the Committee consistent with such regulations. 

6. Term of Option/Vesting. The term of each Incentive Stock Option granted pursuant to the Plan shall be for a period not exceeding ten (10) years from the grant date; provided, however, that if, as of the grant date of an Incentive Stock Option, the grantee owns stock possessing more than 10 of the total combined voting power of all classes of the capital stock of the Company, of any of its present or future subsidiaries (as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code) or of a parent (as defined in Section 424(e) of the Code), the term of the Incentive Stock Option granted to such individual shall be for a period not exceeding five (5) years from the grant date. The term of each Non-Qualified Stock Option granted pursuant to the Plan shall be for a period not exceeding ten (10) years from the grant date. Options shall be subject to earlier termination as hereinafter provided. 

Subject to Section 10(b) hereof, each Option shall have a minimum vesting period of one year from the grant date; provided that, Options with respect to 5 of the total Common Stock authorized to be issued under the Plan may have a vesting period of less than one year. 

7. Exercise or Surrender of Option. (a) General. An Option (or any part or installment thereof) shall be exercised by giving written notice to the Company at its principal office (as of the Effective Date, located at 48 South Service Road, Melville, NY 11747 ), identifying the Option being exercised, specifying the number of shares of Common Stock as to which such Option is being exercised and accompanied by payment in full of the aggregate Exercise Price therefor (i) in cash (including check, bank draft or money order, or wire or other transfer of funds to the Company), (ii) at the discretion of the Committee (including if provided in the applicable Stock Option Contract), in shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value equal to the Exercise Price or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock which in the aggregate are equal in value to such Exercise Price, plus, in either case, any required federal income tax or other withholding amount or (iii) to the extent permitted by law and to the extent permitted by the Committee, in its sole discretion, may be made all or in part by delivery (on a form acceptable to the Committee) of an irrevocable direction to a registered securities broker acceptable to the Company to sell shares of Common Stock and to deliver all or part of the sales proceeds to the Company in payment of the Exercise Price and any required federal income tax or other withholding amount. Certificates representing the shares of Common Stock purchased shall be issued as promptly as practicable thereafter, and, at the discretion of the Committee, such certificates may be issued in the name of the Optionee and another person jointly with the right of survivorship. The Optionee shall not have the right of a shareholder with respect to the shares of Common Stock covered by the Option until the date of issuance of a stock certificate to such Optionee for such shares or as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company. In no case may a fraction of a share be purchased or issued under the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, shares of Common Stock used to satisfy the payment of the Exercise Price or any required federal income tax or other withholding requirements, will not then be again available for issuance under the Plan for grants of Options. 

4

(b) Surrender. (1) General Rule. The Committee may provide in the applicable Stock Option Contract that an Optionee may surrender such Option in whole or in part in lieu of the exercise in whole or in part of that Option on any date that: 

(a) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to such Option exceeds the Exercise Price for such Common Stock; and 

(b) the Option to purchase such Common Stock is otherwise exercisable. 

(2) Procedure. The surrender of an Option in whole or in part shall be effected by the delivery of the Stock Option Contract to the Committee or to its delegate together with a statement signed by the holder of the Option which specifies the number of shares of Common Stock as to which the Optionee surrenders the Option and how the Optionee desires payment be made for such Common Stock surrendered in accordance with this Section 7(b)(2). 

(3) Payment. In exchange for the Option surrendered in accordance with this Section 7(b)(3), the Optionee shall receive a payment in cash or in Common Stock, or in a combination of cash and Common Stock, equal in amount on the date such surrender is effected to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to such Option surrendered in accordance with this Section 7(b)(3) on such date over the Exercise Price for such Common Stock subject to such Option (reduced by any applicable federal income tax or other withholding amount). The Committee may approve or disapprove the request for payment by the Optionee in whole or in part in cash and may cause such payment to be made in cash or in such combination of cash and Common Stock as the Committee deems appropriate. A request for payment only in Common Stock shall be approved and made in Common Stock to the extent payment can be made in whole shares of Common Stock and, at the Committee's discretion, in cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock. 

8. Termination of Employment. Unless otherwise provided in connection with the grant of any Option, the applicable Stock Option Contract or an employment, consulting or severance agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary, (a) upon the termination of employment or service as a director or consultant of any Optionee, all Options held by such Optionee that have not previously become exercisable shall terminate on the date of such termination of employment or service, (b) any Optionee whose employment or whose service as a director or consultant has terminated for any reason other than death, or as set forth in (d) below, may exercise such Option, to the extent exercisable upon the date of such termination, at any time within three (3) months (or, for an Optionee terminated by reason of disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), within one (1) year), after the date of termination, but in no event after the expiration of the term of the Option, (c) with respect to any Optionee whose employment or service as a director or consultant has terminated as a result of the Optionee s death, the executor, administrator or such other person at such time entitled by law to such rights under such Option, may exercise such Option, to the extent exercisable upon the date of such termination, at any time within six (6) months after the date of termination, but in no event after the expiration of the term of the Option and (d) with respect to any Optionee whose employment or service as a director or consultant has terminated either (i) for Cause (as defined below), or (ii) without the consent of the Company, all Options (to the extent not previously exercised) held by such Optionee shall terminate immediately. 

5

Options granted under the Plan shall not be affected by any change of employment (including duties or position) so long as the Optionee continues to be an employee of the Company or of any Subsidiary or of a corporation or its parent or subsidiary issuing or assuming an Option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies. In connection with the termination of employment or service as a director or consultant of any Optionee, the Committee may, in its discretion, determine to permit a longer period than that specified in this Section 8, the applicable Stock Option Contract or an applicable employment, consulting or severance agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary for the exercise of all or any part of such Option after such termination; provided, that, such period does not extend past the expiration of the term of such Option or is otherwise not permitted under Section 409A of the Code. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, need not be uniform among all Options and may reflect distinctions based on the reason for a termination of employment or service. 

For the purpose of the Plan, an employment relationship shall be deemed to exist between an individual and a corporation if, at the time of the determination, the individual was an employee of such corporation for purposes of Section 422(a) of the Code. As a result, an individual on military leave, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence shall continue to be considered an employee for purposes of the Plan during such leave if the period of the leave does not exceed 90 days, or, if longer, so long as the individual's right to re-employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is guaranteed either by applicable law or by contract. If the period of leave exceeds 90 days and the individual s right to re-employment is not guaranteed by applicable law or by contract, the employment relationship shall be deemed to have terminated on the 91st day of such leave. 

Nothing in the Plan or in any Option shall confer on any person any right to continue in the employ or as a consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary, or as a director or consultant of the Company, or interfere in any way with any contractual or other right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate such relationship (or revise the compensation, position or duties of such person) at any time for any reason whatsoever. The obligation of the Company to pay any benefits pursuant to this Plan shall be interpreted as a contractual obligation to pay only those amounts described in this Plan, in the manner and under the conditions prescribed in this Plan, and to the extent that any Optionee or beneficiary acquires a right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Option, such right shall be not greater than the right of any unsecured creditor of the Company. The Plan shall in no way be interpreted to require the Company to transfer any amounts to a third party or otherwise hold any amounts in trust or escrow for payment to any Optionee or beneficiary under the terms of the Plan. 

" Cause ", in connection with the termination of an Optionee, shall mean (i) "cause," as such term (or any similar term, such as "with cause") is defined in any employment, consulting, severance or other applicable agreement for services between the Company or any Subsidiary and such Optionee, or (ii) in the absence of such an agreement, "cause," as such term is defined in the Stock Option Contract executed by the Company and such Optionee pursuant to Section 9 hereof, or (iii) in the absence of both of the foregoing, (A) indictment of such Optionee for any illegal conduct, (B) failure of such Optionee to adequately perform any of the Optionee's duties and responsibilities in any capacity held with the Company or any Subsidiary (other than any such failure resulting solely from such Optionee's physical or mental incapacity), (C) the commission of any act or failure to act by such Optionee that involves moral turpitude, dishonesty, theft, destruction of property, fraud, embezzlement or unethical business conduct, or that is otherwise injurious to the Company or any Subsidiary or any other affiliate of the Company (or its or their respective employees), whether financially or otherwise, (D) any violation by such Optionee of any Company rule or policy, or (E) any violation by such Optionee of the requirements of any other contract or agreement between the Company or any Subsidiary and such Optionee or the Plan (as in effect from time to time); in each case, with respect to subsections (A) through (E), as determined by the Board or the Committee. 

6

9. Stock Option Contracts. Each Option shall be evidenced by an appropriate Stock Option Contract which shall provide, among other things, (a) that in the event of the exercise of such Option, unless the Common Stock received upon exercise shall have been registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the individual acknowledges that such Common Stock may be "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 under such Act and agrees that such Common Stock may not be sold except in compliance with applicable provisions of such Act, and (b) that in the event of any disposition of the Common Stock acquired upon the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option within two (2) years from the grant date or one (1) year from the date of issuance of Common Stock (upon the exercise of such Option) to the Optionee, such Optionee will notify the Company thereof in writing within thirty (30) days after such disposition and will pay to the Company an amount necessary to satisfy any obligations the Company may have to withhold any taxes by reason of such disqualifying disposition. 

10. Adjustments Upon Changes in Common Stock; Certain Other Changes. 

(a) In the event the shares of Common Stock are changed into or exchanged for any other class or series of capital stock or cash or securities or other property pursuant to a recapitalization, reclassification, share split, reverse split, combination of shares, exchange of shares, share dividend or other extraordinary or special distribution, occurring after the Effective Date, the number shares of Common Stock for which grants of Options may be made under the Plan shall be adjusted proportionately and accordingly by the Board, whose determination shall be conclusive. In addition, the number shares of Common Stock for which Options are outstanding shall be adjusted proportionately and accordingly so that the proportionate interest of the Optionee immediately following such event shall, to the extent practicable, be the same as immediately before such event. Any such adjustment in respect of Options shall not change the economic value of such unexercised Options, but shall include a corresponding proportionate adjustment in the Exercise Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any extraordinary or special distribution or dividend to shareholders of the Company but excluding a non-extraordinary or non-special dividend payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock, the Company may, in such manner as the Board, whose determination shall be conclusive, deems appropriate, adjust the number shares of Common Stock subject to the Option and/or the Exercise Price of such Option to reflect such distribution or dividend. Any adjustment under this Section 10 shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Sections 409A and 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 

(b) The provisions of this Section 10(b) shall apply in the case of a Change of Control. If more specific terms are set forth in any separate plan document or agreement between the Company or any Subsidiary and an Optionee, such separate plan or document shall govern the treatment of Options. 

(i) 

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, and except with respect to any Option assumed by the surviving entity or otherwise equitably converted or substituted in connection with the Change of Control in a manner approved by the Committee or the Board, the Committee, in its sole discretion, or as otherwise set forth in a Stock Option Contract, may take such actions as it deems appropriate to provide for the acceleration of the exercisability and vesting in connection with such Change of Control of any or all outstanding Options upon such conditions and to such extent as the Committee shall determine. To the extent that this provision causes Incentive Stock Options to exceed the dollar limitation set forth in Section 422(d) of the Code, the excess Options shall be deemed to be Non-Qualified Stock Options. 

7

(ii) 

With respect to Options assumed by the surviving entity or otherwise equitably converted or substituted in connection with a Change of Control, if within one year after the effective date of a Change of Control, an Optionee s employment or service is terminated without Cause or with Good Reason, then 

a. 

Any time-based vesting restrictions on outstanding Options shall lapse; and 

b. 

The payout opportunities attainable under all of such Optionee s outstanding performance-based Options shall be earned based on actual performance through the end of the performance period, or if actual performance cannot be determined, at target level, and there shall be a payout to the Optionee within 30 days after the amount earned has been determined (unless a later date under Section 10(b)(iii) hereof is required) based on the length of time within the performance period that has lapsed prior to the date of termination. 

To the extent that this provision causes Incentive Stock Options to exceed the dollar limitation set forth in Section 422(d) of the Code, the excess Options shall be deemed to be Non-Qualified Stock Options. 

(iii) 

No action shall be taken under this Section 10(b) which shall cause an Option to fail to be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code or the treasury regulations thereunder. 

For purposes of the foregoing, Change of Control shall mean: (i) any Person (as defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the Exchange Act, but excluding (1) the Company, (2) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company, (3) an underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, or (4) a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the shareholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company), is or becomes the "Beneficial Owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company (not including in the securities Beneficially Owned by such Person any securities acquired directly from the Company) representing 30 or more of the Company's then outstanding securities, excluding any Person who becomes such a Beneficial Owner in connection with a Non-control Merger (as defined in clause (iii) below); or (ii) the following individuals cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the number of directors then serving: individuals who, on the Effective Date, constitute the Board and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to, a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved or recommended by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the Effective Date or whose appointment, election or nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended; or (iii) there is consummated a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation; other than a merger or consolidation immediately following which the individuals who comprise the Board immediately prior thereto constitute at least a majority of the Board, the entity surviving such merger or consolidation or any parent thereof (a " Non-control Merger "); or (iv) the shareholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or there is consummated an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, other than a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets immediately following which the individuals who comprise the Board immediately prior thereto constitute at least a majority of the Board of the entity to which such assets are sold or disposed or any parent thereof. 

8

For purposes of the foregoing, Good Reason , in connection with the termination of an Optionee, shall mean (i) good reason, as such term (or any similar term) is defined in any employment, consulting, severance or other applicable agreement for services between the Company or any Subsidiary and such Optionee, or (ii) in the absence of such agreement, good reason, as such term is defined in the Stock Option Contract executed by the Company and such Optionee pursuant to Section 9 hereof, or (iii) in the absence of both or the foregoing, a voluntary resignation within six (6) months after any of the following actions are taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates without the Optionee s consent: (A) a material diminution in the responsibilities or authority of the Optionee and which is materially inconsistent with the Optionee s position other than (1) in connection with the termination of the Optionee s employment or service for Cause, (2) temporarily while the Optionee is physically or mentally incapacitated or (3) as required by applicable law; (B) a material diminution in the annual base salary, bonus or fees to be paid to the Optionee (other than a general reduction that affects all similarly situated employees, directors or consultants of the Company in substantially the same proportions); or (C) a relocation of the Optionee's principal place of employment or service by more than 50 miles; provided, however, that none of the foregoing events shall constitute Good Reason unless the Optionee shall have notified the Company in writing describing the event(s) which constitute Good Reason within thirty (30) days of the Optionee s knowledge of the event and then only if the Company shall have failed to cure such event(s) within thirty (30) days after the Company s receipt of such written notice. 

In addition, if a Change of Control constitutes a payment event with respect to any amount which constitutes or provides for the deferral of compensation and is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the transaction or event described herein with respect to such amount must also constitute a change in control event, as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code. 

11. Amendments and Termination of the Plan. The Committee may, at any time, suspend or terminate the Plan or revise or amend it in any respect whatsoever, provided, however, that the requisite shareholder approval shall be required if and to the extent the Committee determines that such approval is appropriate or necessary for purposes of satisfying Section 422 of the Code or Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act or other applicable law or regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (or other securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed). Options may be granted under the Plan prior to the receipt of such shareholder approval, but each such grant shall be subject in its entirety to such approval and no Option may be exercised, vested or otherwise satisfied prior to the receipt of such approval. No suspension, termination, revision or amendment of the Plan shall, without the consent of the Optionee affected thereby, adversely affect such Optionee s rights under such Option.

12. Non-Transferability of Options. No Option shall be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and Options may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee thereof, only by the Optionee. 

If authorized in the applicable Stock Option Contract, an Optionee may transfer, not for value, all or part of an Option which is not an Incentive Stock Option to any person who is a spouse, former spouse, child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother, sister, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, of the Optionee, any person sharing the Optionee s household (other than a tenant or employee), a trust in which any one or more of these persons (or the Optionee) have more than fifty percent of the beneficial interest, a foundation in which any one or more of these persons (or the Optionee) control the management of assets, and any other entity in which one or more of these persons (or the Optionee) own more than fifty percent of the voting interests (the Family Members ). For the purpose of this Section 12, a not for value transfer is a transfer which is (i) a gift to a trust for the benefit of the Optionee and/or one or more Family Members, or (ii) a transfer under a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights. Following a transfer under this Section 12 , any such Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer. Subsequent transfers of transferred Options are prohibited except in accordance with this Section 12 or by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The events of termination of employment of Section 8 hereof shall continue to be applied with respect to the original Optionee, following which the Option shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and for the periods specified, in Section 8 hereof. 

13. Conditions of Exercise or Surrender. Each Option shall be subject to the requirement that, if at any time the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the Common Stock subject to such Option upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable, as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of such Option or the issue or purchase of Common Stock thereunder, no such Option may be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee. 

14. Effective Date and Term of Plan. The Plan shall become effective when adopted by the Board (the Effective Date ), but the Plan (and any grants of Options made prior to shareholder approval of the Plan) shall be subject to the requisite approval of the shareholders of the Company. In the absence of such approval, such Options shall be null and void. Unless earlier terminated by the Committee, the right to grant Options under the Plan shall terminate on the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date. Options outstanding at Plan termination shall remain in effect according to their terms and the provisions of the Plan. 

15. Miscellaneous. (a) No Shareholder Rights. No Optionee shall have any rights as a shareholder of the Company as a result of the grant of an Option to the Optionee under this Plan or such Optionee s exercise or surrender of such Option pending the actual issuance of shares of Common Stock subject to such Option to such Optionee. 

(b) Withholding. The exercise or surrender of any Option granted under this Plan shall constitute the Optionee's full and complete consent to whatever action the Committee elects to satisfy the federal and state tax withholding requirements, if any, which the Committee in its discretion deems applicable to such exercise or surrender. 

(c) Dividends. In the event dividends or dividend equivalents are payable with respect to any Option under this Plan, no Stock Option Contract shall otherwise provide for payment of dividends or dividend equivalents on any Option or portion of an Option that is not vested. 

10

(d) Captions. The use of captions in this Plan or any Stock Option Contract is for the convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning of any provision of the Plan or such Stock Option Contract. 

(e) Number and Gender. With respect to words used in this Plan, the singular form shall include the plural form, the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender, etc., as the context requires. 

(f) Severability. If any provision of this Plan or any Stock Option Contract shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable by any court of law in any jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of the Plan or the Stock Option Contract, as applicable, shall be severable and enforceable in accordance with their terms, and all provisions shall remain enforceable in any other jurisdiction. 

16. Foreign Employees. In order to facilitate the making of any grant under this Plan, the Committee may provide for such special terms for grants to employees or other persons under this Plan who are foreign nationals or who are employed by the Company or any Subsidiary outside the United States of America as the Committee may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy or custom. Moreover, the Committee may approve such supplements to or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of this Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes, without thereby affecting the terms of this Plan as in effect for any other purpose, and the Secretary or other appropriate officer of the Company may certify any such document as having been approved and adopted in the same manner as this Plan. No such special terms, supplements, amendments or restatements, however, shall include any provision that is inconsistent with the terms of this Plan as then in effect unless this Plan could have been amended to eliminate such inconsistency without further approval by the shareholders of the Company. 

17. Recoupment Policy. Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan, any Stock Option Contract or any employment, consulting or severance agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary, all Options under this Plan shall be subject to any compensation recoupment, other compensation recovery or clawback policy of the Company that may be applicable to any Optionee, as in effect from time to time, as approved by the Committee or the Board. 

18. Section 409A. This Plan and Options are intended to either be exempt from, or comply in form and operation with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the final regulations issued thereunder. To the extent permitted by applicable Department of Treasury/Internal Revenue Service guidance, or law or regulation, the Company will take reasonable actions to reform this Plan and/or Option or any actions taken pursuant to the operation of this Plan if necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or any Subsidiary, affiliates or representatives be liable to the Optionee for any additional tax, interest or penalty imposed upon, or other detriment suffered by, the Optionee under Section 409A of the Code or for any damage suffered by the Optionee for failure of this Plan and/or Option to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code. In addition, for purposes of this Plan and Options, all references to termination of employment and correlative phrases shall be construed to require a separation from service (as defined in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury regulations after giving effect to the presumptions contained therein). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the Optionee is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then to the extent required in order to avoid additional and/or accelerated taxation under Section 409A of the Code, if the Optionee becomes entitled to receive a payout in respect to such Optionee s Options on account of the Optionee s termination of employment as set forth in this Plan, such payout shall be paid on the earlier of (i) the first business day after the date that is six (6) months following the Optionee s termination or (ii) the date of the Optionee s death. 

11

19. Section 280G. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any other agreement, contract or understanding entered into by an Optionee and the Company or any Subsidiary, except an agreement, contract or understanding hereinafter entered into that expressly modifies or excludes application of this paragraph, and notwithstanding any formal or informal plan or other arrangement for the direct or indirect provision of compensation to the Optionee (including groups or classes of Optionees or beneficiaries of which the Optionee is a member), whether or not such compensation is deferred, is in cash, or is in the form of a benefit to or for the Optionee, if the Optionee is a disqualified individual, as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code and any payment or benefit (whether or not pursuant to this Plan) the Optionee would receive in connection with a Change of Control from the Company or otherwise (the Payment would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) but for this paragraph, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then the Optionee shall receive the Payment that provides the greater after-tax benefit to the Optionee based on the following two alternatives: (A) payment in full of the entire amount of the Payment, or (B) payment of only a part of the Payment so that the Optionee receives the largest payment possible without the imposition of the Excise Tax (a Reduced Payment ). In determining the Reduced Payment, the reduction in payments and/or benefits shall occur in the following order: (A) reduction of cash payments in the reverse chronological order in which otherwise payable; (B) cancellation of accelerated vesting of outstanding Options; and (C) reduction of other benefits paid to Optionee in the reverse chronological order in which otherwise payable. In the event that acceleration of compensation from outstanding Options is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be canceled in the reverse order of the grant date and, in the case of a particular grant, in the reverse chronological order in which the grant would otherwise vest. 

20. Statute of Limitations. An Optionee or any other person filing a claim for benefits under this Plan must file a claim within one-year after the Optionee or other person knew or reasonably should have known of the principal facts on which the claim is based. 

21. Governing Law. The validity and construction of this Plan and Stock Option Contracts shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice or conflicts of laws provisions or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.
