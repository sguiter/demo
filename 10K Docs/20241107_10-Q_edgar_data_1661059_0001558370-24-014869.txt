The Company did not realize any gains or losses on available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company reviewed all investments which were in a loss position at the respective balance sheet dates, as well as the remainder of the portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had investments with a total fair market value of million in an immaterial unrealized loss position, of which were in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than twelve months. The Company analyzed the unrealized losses and determined that market conditions were the primary factor driving these changes, and such unrealized losses are temporary as the Company anticipates a full recovery of the amortized cost basis of these securities at maturity. After analyzing the securities in an unrealized loss position, the portion of these losses that relates to changes in credit quality is insignificant. The Company does not intend to sell these securities, nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell them prior to the end of their contractual terms.

Under the terms of the leases, the Company pays base annual rent subject to fixed dollar increases each year and other normal operating expenses such as taxes, repairs, and maintenance. The Company evaluates renewal options at lease inception and on an ongoing basis and considers renewal options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise in its expected lease terms when classifying leases and measuring lease liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 842. The leases do not require variable lease payments or residual value guarantees and do not contain restrictive covenants. The leases do not provide an implicit rate; therefore, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring the operating lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease expense was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Operating lease expense was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

Under the terms of the Agreement, both parties equally share the costs of developing the molecules and profits on commercialized products. The collaboration consists of up to research programs for which a research plan will be developed. With respect to a research plan, each party shall use reasonable efforts to execute and perform the activities assigned to it. Each party shall be solely responsible for costs associated with its assigned activities as outlined in the research plan. Upon successful completion of a research plan, or as otherwise agreed, the parties may designate a research product as a co-development product. Upon designation of a co-development product, cost sharing on a -50 basis between the Company and LigaChem would begin. The activities associated with the research plan and co-development products will be coordinated by a joint steering committee, which is comprised of an equal number of representatives from the Company and LigaChem. If and when a co-development product becomes commercialized, the Company and LigaChem would equally share in the profits. There are no implied licenses or other rights created under this Agreement after designation of a co-development product.

 -50 basis commenced for the first co-development product under the Agreement. Given the involvement by both parties under this Agreement, management assessed the criteria under ASC 808 to determine if such agreement is within the scope of ASC 808. Based on the terms of the Agreement, the Company concluded that the Agreement meets the requirements of a collaboration within the guidance of ASC 808. The Company and LigaChem are active participants in the activities associated with the Agreement and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity. The Agreement is not reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore not within the scope of ASC 606. Accordingly, the net costs associated with the co-development pursuant to the Agreement are expensed as incurred and recognized within research and development expenses on the statement of operations. As of September 30, 2024, LNCB74 was the lone co-development product and was in the early stages of development. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred more costs than LigaChem under the Agreement, and recorded a reduction in costs of million and million, respectively, reflecting the -50 cost sharing terms under the Agreement. Further, the Company and LigaChem finalized the cost sharing adjustments from the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting in an additional reduction in costs of million that was recorded in the first quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a receivable from LigaChem of million. . Employees affected by the reduction in force under the 2024 Restructuring were entitled to receive severance payments and Company-funded medical insurance for a specified time. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized million for employees who had no requirements for future service upon approval of the 2024 Restructuring. This million was paid out in full during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and there is remaining liability as of September 30, 2024. The Company also completed an evaluation of the impact of the 2024 Restructuring on the carrying value of its long-lived assets. Our evaluation determined that indicators of impairment were present within right of use assets and property and equipment. Where impairment indicators existed, the Company evaluated the identified asset group and separately compared the estimated undiscounted cash flow for each asset group to the net book value of the related long-term asset. Based on this evaluation, the Company determined an impairment was present and then calculated the amount of the impairment by developing a fair value estimate of the asset group that was compared to the carrying value. The Company recorded million of impairment charges related to a facility operating lease asset and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing equipment for the three months ended March 31, 2024. No additional impairment charges were recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Assumptions used in this analysis included current real estate trends, length of time to enter into a sublease and the discount rate used to develop the present value estimate. Other assumptions included an estimate of the salvage value for manufacturing equipment that is no longer in use. These assumptions are considered nonrecurring Level 3 estimates.

Therefore, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same. The Company excluded the following potential common shares, presented based on amounts outstanding at period end, from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the period indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect: Total t record a provision or benefit for income taxes during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence involving its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Management has considered the Company s history of cumulative net losses incurred since inception and its lack of any commercially ready products. It has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets. Management reevaluates the positive and negative evidence at each reporting period. Under the provisions of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the IRC ), certain substantial changes in the Company s ownership may have limited, or may limit in the future, the amount of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that can be used to reduce future income taxes. We have not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC occurred. The

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report and the audited financial information and related notes, as well as Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other disclosures, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, or our 2023 Annual Report. Some of the statements contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as aim, anticipate, assume, believe, continue, could, due, estimate, expect, intend, may, objective, plan, predict, project, potential, positioned, seek, should, target, will, would and other similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and future trends, or the negative of these terms or similar language. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: our expectations regarding the timing, progress and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for any product candidates we develop, including statements regarding the timing of initiation and completion of studies or trials and related preparatory work, the period during which the results of the trials will become available and our research and development programs; the timing or likelihood of regulatory filings for any product candidates we develop and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for such product candidates for any indication; the identification, analysis and use of biomarkers and biomarker data; the anticipated benefits of our recently announced prioritization and restructuring plan; our drug product sourcing and manufacturing strategy, including the scalability of our methods and processes; our expectations regarding the potential benefits, activity, effectiveness and safety of any product candidates we develop; our intentions and ability to successfully commercialize, including through partnering, our product candidates; our expectations regarding the nature of the biological pathways we are targeting; our expectations regarding our ability to discover and advance product candidates using our technologies; the potential benefits of and our ability to maintain our relationship with Yale University, LigaChem Biosciences, Inc. and other third parties; our ability to retain key personnel; our estimates regarding our expenses, future revenues, capital requirements, needs for or ability to obtain additional financing and the period over which we expect our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to be sufficient to fund our operations; our intended reliance on and the performance of third parties, including collaborators, contract research organizations and third-party manufacturers; our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property protection and the scope and duration of such protection; developments and projections relating to our competitors and our industry, including competing therapies; and the impact of current and future laws and regulations.

 Forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others: the potential that positive results in preclinical studies may not be predictive of the results of clinical trials; our limited operating history and lack of any products approved for commercial sale; our history of significant losses; our need and ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all; risks related to clinical development, marketing approval and commercialization; the unproven approach to the discovery and development of product candidates based on our technologies; risks related to our restructuring and reduction in force; and our dependence on key personnel. More detailed information on these and additional factors that could affect our actual results are described under the heading Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, even if expectations change. Overview We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is focused on advancing innovative medicines that treat cancer patients that do not respond to, or have disease progression on, current therapies, through the use of differentiated mechanisms of actions including antibody-drug conjugates ADCs ), antibodies and proteins. We focus on advancing therapies that leverage our core strengths in understanding biological pathways and biomarkers, the interactions of cells, including in the tumor microenvironment, and the role each interaction plays in a biologic response. Our product candidate LNCB74 is designed as a state-of-the-art B7-H4 targeted ADC to kill tumors. An ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic drug via a chemical linker. B7-H4, a clinically validated target, is a cell surface protein expressed on multiple tumor types including breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, that we believe represents a large market opportunity. LNCB74 will be positioned as a promising B7-H4 ADC with both improved safety and efficacy compared to other ADCs targeting B7-H4. LNCB74 is being advanced under a November 2022 Research Collaboration and Co-Development Agreement LigaChem Agreement with LigaChem Biosciences, Inc. (LigaChem ). Preclilnical studies demonstrated potent tumor killing in disease models and a favorable safety profile. We plan to file an IND application by year-end and advance into Phase 1, subject to and shortly after our receipt of an FDA safe-to-proceed letter. In November 2024, we announced an update on ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in the Phase 1b portion of a Phase1b/2 study evaluating NC410, a fusion protein of LAIR-2 that we have exclusive worldwide rights to, in combination with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), Merck Co., Inc. s anti-PD-1 therapeutic. As of October 14, there are four active ovarian cancer and seven active CRC patients that remain in the study, and they will continue to be monitored. Previously reported clinical responses to date and biomarker data support the proposed mechanism of action of NC410. As we continue to close out the existing study and finalize the data set, we plan to seek partnering or third party financing to advance NC410 in further clinical trials. In addition, we are seeking to partner our clinical programs NC525 and NC318 and pursue a partner or third party financing to advance our preclinical non-oncology programs. Our non-oncology programs include NC181, a humanized antibody targeting ApoE4 for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease, and NC605, an antibody that targets Siglic-15 for the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta. We believe that both of these non-oncology programs have the potential to file an IND application within twelve to eighteen months if financial support from a partner or third parties is secured. In March 2024, we announced a prioritization and restructuring of our operations to align with our focused pipeline. We paused our internal manufacturing operations and reduced our workforce. In part because of these actions, we expect to fund our operations into the second half of 2026 with our existing cash position of approximately 75.3 million as of September 30, 2024.

 Financial Overview Since commencing operations in 2015, we have devoted substantially all our efforts and financial resources to discovery, research, and development activities for the Company s product candidates, identifying business development opportunities, raising capital, securing intellectual property rights related to the Company s product candidates and organizing and staffing the Company. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from public offerings of our common stock, with private placements of our preferred stock and with upfront fees received under our former research and development collaboration agreement. Since inception through September 30, 2024, we raised approximately 423 million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity instruments and previously received a 25 million upfront payment from our former collaboration partner. Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 11.5 million and 14.3 million, respectively. Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 44.1 million and 48.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 368.5 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses. We do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval and commercialize a product candidate, and we cannot assure you that we will ever generate significant revenue or profits. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 75.3 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the second half of 2026. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future as we advance LNCB74 through clinical development, the regulatory approval process and, if approved, commercialization. Specifically, in the near term, we expect to incur expenses relating to ramping up clinical development activities with respect to LNCB74, concluding our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of NC410 in combination with pembrolizumab, and other research and development activities. We will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and to pursue our development strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical trials, or other research and development activities or one or more of our development programs. Components of Our Results of Operations Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our clinical trials, research activities, and development and testing of our product candidates: expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including agreements with third parties that conduct research, preclinical activities or clinical trials on our behalf; costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses; the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials;

 salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs. 
 We expense research and development costs as incurred. Our expenses related to clinical trials are based on actual costs incurred and estimates of other incurred costs. These estimated costs are based on several factors, including patient enrollment and related expenses at clinical investigator sites, contract services received, consulting agreement costs and efforts expended under contracts with research institutions and third-party contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. We generally accrue estimated costs related to clinical trials based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and other activity according to the protocol. If future timelines or contracts are modified based on changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we would modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. Historically, any such modifications have not been material. Research and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in the future as we advance our product candidates through development. We cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of future clinical trials of LNCB74 or any other product candidate we may develop or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of LNCB74 and any other product candidate we may develop will depend on a variety of factors, including: the scope, progress, results and costs of clinical trials of LNCB74, as well as of any future clinical trials of other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct; our ability to obtain partnerships for our other programs; uncertainties in selection of indications, clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates; the probability of success for our product candidates, including safety and efficacy, early clinical data, competition, ease and ability of manufacturing and commercial viability; significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; the timing and receipt of any development or marketing approvals; and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could lead to a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time to complete clinical development for any such product candidate.

 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs, including payroll and stock- based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, human resources, business and corporate development and other administrative functions, professional fees for legal, intellectual property, consulting and accounting services, rent and other facility-related costs, depreciation and other general operating expenses not otherwise classified as research and development expenses. General and administrative expenses also include all patent-related costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications, which are expensed as incurred. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges Restructuring charges consist of severance charges associated with a reduction in force, and include salary continuation, payroll taxes and company funded benefits. Asset impairment charges reflect the write-down of long-lived assets that are considered impaired under ASC 360. Other Income, Net Other income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on marketable securities. Results of Operations Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated (in thousands):

 We do not allocate personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation costs, or other indirect costs to specific programs, as they are deployed across multiple projects under development and discovery and, as such, are separately classified as internal research and development expenses in the table above. The majority of other program expenses in the table above represent clinical programs that we seek to partner. Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 2.2 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower costs on other programs and preclinical development and lower internal costs, primarily lower personnel-related costs and depreciation. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 3.5 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as net costs for the LNCB74 program were offset by lower costs on other programs and preclinical development and lower internal costs, primarily lower personnel-related costs and depreciation. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.9 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower payroll, lower stock compensation expense, and lower insurance costs. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 3.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower payroll, lower stock compensation expense, and lower insurance costs. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges Restructuring and asset impairment charges were 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of 0.7 million of severance charges as a result of a reduction in force announced on March 21, 2024, and 1.8 million of asset impairment charges associated with the write-down of certain manufacturing equipment, right of use assets and related improvements as a result of the pause in manufacturing that we announced on March 21, 2024. There were no restructuring and asset impairment charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other Income, Net Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower interest income as a result of lower cash available to invest. Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.3 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as lower interest income as a result of lower cash available to invest was partially offset by higher accretion of investment discounts on marketable securities. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from public offerings of our common stock, private placements of our preferred stock and upfront fees received under the Company s former agreement with Eli Lilly and Company, which was terminated in March 2020 (the Lilly Agreement ). On May 13, 2019, we closed our IPO, in which we sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of 15.00 per share, for net offering proceeds to us of approximately 77.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. On November 19, 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold 4,077,192 shares of common stock at a public offering price of 36.75 per share. On December 2, 2019, the underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 611,578 shares of common stock at a public offering price of 36.75. Net offering proceeds to us were approximately 160.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Since inception, we have received aggregate gross proceeds of 164.4 million from the sale and issuance of shares of our 

 20 

Table of Contents 
 preferred stock. In addition, in November 2018, we received an upfront payment of 25.0 million in cash from Lilly pursuant to the Lilly Agreement. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in money market funds. On August 4, 2023, we entered into a sales agreement (the Sales Agreement with Leerink Partners LLC (the Agent ), pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of 75 million of our common stock through the Agent in negotiated transactions that are deemed to be an at the market offering. The Agent will be entitled to compensation equal to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from the sale of all shares of common stock sold through it as Agent under the Sales Agreement. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of the common stock, capital needs and determinations by us of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 17,151 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 39,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 75.3 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the second half of 2026. We will continue to require additional capital to develop our product candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. We may seek to raise capital through sale of equity, debt financings, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such arrangements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development of our product candidates or delay our efforts to expand our pipeline of product candidates. Cash Flows The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented below (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (33,836) (42,304) Investing activities 48,348 35,110 Financing activities 108 83 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 14,620 (7,111) Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 33.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily the result of our net loss of 44.1 million, partially offset by non-cash charges for depreciation of 2.2 million, stock-based compensation of 4.8 million and impairment charges of 1.8 million, and 1.9 million provided by net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities was 42.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily the result of our net loss of 48.3 million and a 3.1 million net use of operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of 2.9 million and stock-based compensation of 6.2 million. Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 48.3 million, which was primarily due to net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of 48.9 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 35.1 million, which was primarily due to net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of 35.9 million, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of 0.8 million.

Table of Contents 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 representing the exercise of stock options, sales of stock under the ESPP and the sale of 17,151 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement. Net cash provided by financing activities was 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 representing sales of our stock under the ESPP and the exercise of stock options. Contractual Obligations and Commitments There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to those disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates Our condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP . The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. The most significant assumptions used in the financial statements are the underlying assumptions used in valuing share-based compensation, including the fair value of our common stock in periods before our IPO. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies reported in our 2023 Annual Report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Since our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to our unaudited condensed financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that may impact our financial position and results of operations. Emerging Growth Company Status As an emerging growth company, or EGC , under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act , we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not EGCs. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for adopting new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company will cease to be an EGC effective December 31, 2024, meaning it will have to comply with all applicable SEC requirements for non-EGC s starting with its next Form 10-K filing. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we are not required to provide the information requested by this Item.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
