 The Bank provides business-banking products and services predominantly to Asian-centric communities through full service branches located in Los Angeles County, Orange County and Ventura County in California, Las Vegas (Nevada), the New York City metropolitan areas, Chicago (Illinois), Edison (New Jersey) and Honolulu (Hawaii). The products and services include commercial and investor real estate loans, business loans and lines of credit, Small Business Administration SBA 7A and 504 loans, mortgage loans, trade finance and a full range of depository accounts, including specialized services such as remote deposit, E-banking, mobile banking and treasury management services. 
 
 We operate as a minority depository institution MDI ), which is defined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC as a federally insured depository institution where 51 or more of the voting stock is owned by minority individuals or a majority of the board of directors is minority and the community that the institution serves is predominantly minority. A MDI is eligible to receive support from the FDIC and other federal regulatory agencies such as training, technical assistance and review of proposed new deposit taking and lending programs, and the adoption of applicable policies and procedures governing such programs. We intend to maintain our MDI designation, as it is expected that at least 51 of our issued and outstanding shares of capital shall remain owned by minority individuals. The MDI designation has been historically beneficial to us, and we continue to use the program for technical assistance. 
 
 We operate full-service banking offices in Arcadia, Cerritos, Diamond Bar, Irvine, Los Angeles, Monterey Park, Oxnard, Rowland Heights, San Gabriel, Silver Lake, Torrance, and Westlake Village, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Manhattan, Brooklyn, Flushing, and Elmhurst, New York; the Chinatown and Bridgeport neighborhoods of Chicago, Illinois; Edison, New Jersey; and Honolulu, Hawaii. Our primary source of revenue is providing loans to customers, who are predominantly small and middle-market businesses and individuals. 
 
 We generate our revenue primarily from interest received on loans and, to a lesser extent, from interest received on investment securities. We also derive income from noninterest sources, such as fees received in connection with various lending and deposit services, loan servicing, gain on sales of loans and wealth management services. Our principal expenses include interest expense on deposits and borrowings, and operating expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, and income tax expense. 
 
 We completed six whole bank acquisitions and one branch acquisition from July 2011 through January 2022. All of our acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of the acquired entities have been included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were compiled in accordance with the accounting policies set forth in "Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our 2023 Annual Report. The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issues Accounting Standards Updates ("ASU" or Update and Accounting Standards Codifications ASC ), which are the primary source of GAAP. We have not made any changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. 

Recently issued not yet effective 
 
 In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 - 06, Disclosure Improvements. This pronouncement amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to reflect updates and simplifications to certain disclosure requirements referred to the FASB by the SEC in 2018, including disclosures for the statement of cash flows, earnings per share, commitments, debt and equity instruments, and certain industry information, among other things. Each amendment is effective when the related disclosure is effectively removed from Regulations S- X or S-K; early adoption is prohibited. All amendments should be applied prospectively. If the SEC has not removed the applicable requirement from Regulation S- X or Regulation S-K by June 30, 2027, the pending amendments will be removed and will not become effective for any entity. Adoption of ASU 2023 - 06 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 - 07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280 - Improvements to Reportable Segments. The amendments in this Update improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. Amendments in this Update include: a requirement that a public entity provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss in its interim period disclosures, disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM ), disclosure of amounts for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition, clarification that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, a public entity may report one or more of those additional measures of segment profit or loss, a requirement that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM, and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss, and a requirement that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by this Update as well as all existing disclosures required in Topic 280. The amendments in this Update are effective for the Company beginning with its 2024 annual financial statement disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2024, and for all interim and annual periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of ASU 2023 - 07 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 - 09, Income Taxes (Topic 740 - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This Update enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this Update require the following: 1 consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and 2 income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The amendments in the ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The amendments in this Update should be applied on a prospective basis. However, retrospective application in all prior periods presented is permitted. Adoption of ASU 2023 - 09 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

We pledged investment securities with a fair value of million and million for certificates of deposit from the State of California, secured Federal funds arrangements, and other local agency deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 There were no sales of investment securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

The table below summarizes amortized cost and fair value of the investment securities portfolio, by expected maturity, as of the dates indicated. Mortgage-backed securities are classified in accordance with their estimated average life. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The securities that were in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were evaluated to determine whether the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis resulted from a credit loss or other factors. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no allowance for credit losses ACL on the HTM securities portfolio. 
 
 We concluded that the unrealized losses were primarily attributed to yield curve movement, together with widened liquidity spreads and credit spreads. The issuers have not, to our knowledge, established any cause for default on these securities. We expect to recover the amortized cost basis of our securities and have no present intent to sell and will not be required to sell securities that have declined below their cost before their anticipated recovery. As of September 30, 2024 all of our HTM securities were rated AA- or above. Accordingly, no ACL was recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, against AFS securities, and there was no provision for credit losses recognized for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Equity Securities - We have several Community Reinvestment Act CRA equity investments, other bank stock, and other equity investments. We recorded no gain or loss for any of the periods presented. Other equity securities (included in Accrued interest and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets) were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

We categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, collateral adequacy, credit documentation, and current economic trends, among other factors. We analyze loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis typically includes larger, non-homogeneous loans such as commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. This analysis is performed on an ongoing basis as new information is obtained. We use the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 
 Pass - Loans classified as pass include loans not meeting the risk ratings defined below. 
 
 Special Mention - Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 
 
 Substandard - Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful - Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 The following tables summarize our loans HFI by loan portfolio segment, risk rating and vintage year as of the dates indicated. The vintage year is the year of origination, renewal or major modification.

interest income was recognized on a cash basis during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. We did not recognize any interest income on nonaccrual loans during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, while the loans were in nonaccrual status. 
 
 On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022 - 02, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326 )." Under this guidance, we may modify loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, payment delay or interest rate reduction. We may provide multiple types of concessions on one loan. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. 
 
 The total balance of modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty was million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. One C D loan with a balance of million was modified during the third quarter of 2024. The loan migrated to nonaccrual, was downgraded to Substandard and remained in default as of September 30, 2024. One CRE loan with a balance of million at September 30, 2024 was modified in the fourth quarter of 2023, and remains a nonaccrual loan and in default at September 30, 2024. There were no loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 There were no commitments to lend additional amounts to customers with outstanding modified loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Servicing income is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is net against loan servicing income. Loan servicing income, net of amortization, totaled , , and for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

When loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in gains on sales of loans. Fair value is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method, which requires servicing rights to be amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. 
 
 Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is recognized through a charge to income to establish a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If we later determine that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, then a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to income.

Estimates of the loan servicing asset fair value are derived through a discounted cash flow analysis. Portfolio characteristics include loan delinquency rates, age of loans, note rate and geography. The assumptions embedded in the valuation are obtained from a range of metrics utilized by active buyers in the marketplace. The analysis accounts for recent transactions, and supply and demand within the market. 
 
 The estimated fair value of servicing assets for mortgage loans was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

billion at the beginning of the year) and banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. 
 
 Final comprehensive regulatory capital rules for U.S. banking organizations pursuant to the capital framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, generally referred to as Basel III, implemented a requirement for all banking organizations to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 above the minimum risk-based capital requirements, which fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is exclusively comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not to the leverage ratio. At September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank were in compliance with the capital conservation buffer requirements. If the capital adequacy minimum ratios plus the phased-in conservation buffer amount exceed actual risk-weighted capital ratios, then dividends, share buybacks, and discretionary bonuses to executives could be limited in amount. 
 
 Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank's assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total, Tier 1 and CET1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). As permitted by the regulators for financial institutions that are not deemed to be advanced approaches institutions, the Company has elected to opt out of the Basel III requirement to include accumulated other comprehensive income in risk-based capital. Management believes, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, RBB and the Bank satisfied all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject.

 The California Financial Code generally acts to prohibit banks from making a cash distribution to its shareholders in excess of the lesser of the bank's undivided profits or the bank's net income for its last three fiscal years less the amount of any distribution made by the bank's shareholders during the same period. 
 
 The California General Corporation Law generally acts to prohibit companies from paying dividends on common stock unless retained earnings, immediately prior to the dividend payment, equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend. If a company fails this test, then it may still pay dividends if after giving effect to the dividend the company's assets are at least of its liabilities. 
 
 Additionally, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance which requires that they be consulted before payment of a dividend if a financial holding company does not have earnings over the prior four quarters of at least equal to the dividend to be paid, plus other holding company obligations. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 
 Securities: 
 
 The fair values of securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level
 1 or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level
 2 ).

Interest Rate Lock Contracts and Forward Mortgage Loan Sale Contracts: 
 The fair values of interest rate lock contracts and forward mortgage loan sale contracts are determined by loan lock-in rate, loan funded rate, market interest rate, fees to be collected from the borrower, fees and costs associated with the origination of the loan, expiration timing, sale price, and the value of the retained servicing. We classified these derivatives as level 3 due to management s estimate of market rate, cost and expiration timing on these contracts. 
 
 Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis 
 
 Collateral-dependent individually evaluated loans: 
 Collateral-dependent individually evaluated loans are carried at fair value when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement and the loan has been written down to the fair value of its underlying collateral, net of expected selling costs. 
 
 The fair value of collateral-dependent individually evaluated loans is based on third party appraisals of the property, less management s estimate of selling costs. Third party appraisals generally use a sales comparison or income capitalization approach to derive the appraised value based on market transactions involving similar or comparable properties. Adjustments are routinely made by the third party appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data used in the appraisal. Adjustments may also result from the consideration of relevant economic and demographic factors which may affect property values. Positive adjustments in the appraisal represent increases to the sales comparisons and negative adjustments represent decreases. 
 
 Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO"): 
 
 OREO is initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of transfer. This amount becomes the property's new basis. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value less estimated selling costs at the time of transfer, the difference is charged to the ACL. Fair values are generally based on
 third party appraisals of the property and discounted by management to reflect an expectation of the amount to be ultimately collected after foreclosure and selling costs (Level
 3 ).

Appraisals for OREO and collateral-dependent loans are performed by state licensed appraisers (for commercial properties) or state certified appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by us. A member of the credit administration department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison to independent data sources such as recent market data or industry wide statistics for residential appraisals. We also compare the actual selling price of collateral that has been sold to the most recently appraised value to determine what additional adjustments, if any, should be made to the appraisal values on any remaining OREO to arrive at fair value. In determining the net realizable value of the underlying collateral for individually evaluated loans and OREO, we discount the valuation to cover both market price fluctuations and selling costs, typically ranging from 6 to 10 of the collateral value, that may be incurred in the event of foreclosure. If the existing appraisal is older than twelve months for OREO or collateral-dependent loans, a new appraisal report is ordered.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 Management has established various accounting policies that govern the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. GAAP in the preparation of our financial statements. Certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company s critical accounting policies consist of the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment, investment securities, goodwill and income taxes. Please see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("2023 Annual Report") for additional discussion concerning these critical accounting policies. Also, our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report, and are essential to understanding Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) 
 
 A sensitivity analysis of our ACL was performed as of September 30, 2024. Based on this sensitivity analysis, a positive 25 change in prepayment speed would result in a 1.4 million, or 3.18 , decrease to the ACL. A negative 25 change in prepayment speed would result in a 1.7 million, or 3.59 , increase to the ACL. Additionally, a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate would result in a 1.1 million, or 2.32 , increase to the ACL and a one percentage point decrease in the unemployment rate would result in a 1.1 million, or 2.46 , decrease to the ACL. Management reviews the results using the comparison scenario for sensitivity analysis and considers the results when evaluating the qualitative factor adjustments. 
 
 On a quarterly basis, we stress test the qualitative factors, which are lending policy, procedures and strategies, economic conditions, changes in nature and volume of the portfolio, credit and lending staff, problem loan trends, loan review results, collateral value, concentrations and regulatory and business environment by creating two scenarios, moderate risk and major risk. In the Moderate Stress scenario, the status of all nine risk factors across all pooled loan types were set at High-Moderate Risk while in the Major Stress scenario, the status of all nine risk factors across all pooled loan types were set at Major Risk. Under the Moderate Stress scenario, the ACL would increase by 9.3 million, or 21.38 , as of September 30, 2024. Under the Major Stress scenario, the ACL would increase by 24.4 million, or 56.10 , as of September 30, 2024. Management compares the stress test results to our internal forecasts for earnings and capital and has concluded that the Company would remain well capitalized under these stressed scenarios.

GENERAL 
 
 RBB Bancorp is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. RBB Bancorp s principal business is to serve as the holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Bank and RBB Asset Management Company RAM ). RAM was formed to hold and manage problem assets acquired in business combinations. When we refer to we , us , our , or the Company , we are referring to RBB Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiaries including the Bank, collectively. When we refer to the parent company , Bancorp , or the holding company , we are referring to RBB Bancorp, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis. At September 30, 2024, we had total assets of 4.0 billion, gross loans held for investment ("HFI") of 3.1 billion, total deposits of 3.1 billion and total shareholders' equity of 509.7 million. RBB s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol RBB. 
 
 The Bank provides business-banking products and services predominantly to Asian-centric communities through full service branches located in Los Angeles County, Orange County and Ventura County in California, in the Las Vegas (Nevada), the New York City metropolitan areas, Chicago (Illinois), Edison (New Jersey) and Honolulu (Hawaii). The products and services include commercial and investor real estate loans, business loans and lines of credit, Small Business Administration SBA 7A and 504 loans, mortgage loans, trade finance and a full range of depository accounts, including specialized services such as remote deposit, E-banking, mobile banking and treasury management services. 
 
 We operate as a minority depository institution ("MDI"), which is defined by the FDIC as a federally insured depository institution where 51 or more of the voting stock is owned by minority individuals or a majority of the board of directors is minority and the community that the institution serves is predominantly minority. A MDI is eligible to receive support from the FDIC and other federal regulatory agencies such as training, technical assistance and review of proposed new deposit taking and lending programs, and the adoption of applicable policies and procedures governing such programs. We intend to maintain our MDI designation, as it is expected that at least 51 of our issued and outstanding shares of capital shall remain owned by minority individuals. The MDI designation has been historically beneficial to us, and we continue to use the program for technical assistance. 
 
 We operate full-service banking offices in Arcadia, Cerritos, Diamond Bar, Irvine, Los Angeles, Monterey Park, Oxnard, Rowland Heights, San Gabriel, Silver Lake, Torrance, and Westlake Village, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Manhattan, Brooklyn, Flushing and Elmhurst, New York; the Chinatown and Bridgeport neighborhoods of Chicago, Illinois; Edison, New Jersey; and Honolulu, Hawaii.

Table of Contents 

We have completed six whole bank acquisitions and one branch acquisition from July 2011 through January 2022. All of our acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of the acquired entities have been included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. 

OVERVIEW 
 
 The following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of RBB and its wholly owned subsidiaries. This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of our operations. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Report. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. 
 
 We reported net income of 7.0 million, or 0.39 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 7.2 million, or 0.39 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and 8.5 million, or 0.45 diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, total assets were 4.0 billion, a decrease of 35.5 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to an 82.0 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a 13.3 million decrease in available for sale ("AFS") investment securities, partially offset by a 60.0 million increase in gross loans HFI. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to a decrease in wholesale deposits, offset by an increase in retail deposits and FHLB advances. Wholesale deposits include brokered deposits, collateralized deposits from the State of California, and deposits acquired through internet listing services. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, AFS investment securities totaled 305.7 million, inclusive of a pre-tax net unrealized loss of 23.2 million, compared to 319.0 million, inclusive of a pre-tax unrealized loss of 28.1 million at December 31, 2023. The pre-tax unrealized loss was due to a decline in the value of AFS investment securities due to continued higher market interest rates in 2024. 
 
 Total loans HFI, net of deferred fees and discounts, increased 60.0 million, or 2.0 , to 3.1 billion at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial real estate ("CRE") loans of 84.8 million, partially offset by decreases in single-family residential ("SFR") mortgages of 14.4 million, Small Business Administration SBA loans of 4.0 million, construction and land development ("C D") loans of 1.3 million, commercial and industrial C I loans of 1.2 million, and other loans of 3.9 million. The loan to deposit ratio was 98.6 at September 30, 2024, compared to 94.2 at December 31, 2023, and 97.6 at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Total deposits were 3.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, an 82.6 million, or 2.6 , decrease compared to 3.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. This decrease was due to lower interest-bearing deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased 4.0 million to 543.6 million at September 30, 2024, or 17.6 of total deposits, compared to 539.6 million, or 17.0 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. The decrease in interest-bearing deposits included a decrease in time deposits of 119.9 million, offset by an increase in non-maturity deposits of 33.4 million. The 119.9 million decrease in time deposits included a 258.3 million decrease in wholesale deposits, partially replaced by an increase of 138.4 million in retail deposits. Wholesale deposits totaled 147.3 million at September 30, 2024 and 405.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Borrowings, consisting of Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances, long-term debt and subordinated debentures, were 334.5 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 50.5 million from 284.1 million as of December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had 200.0 million of advances, of which 150 million had an original term of five years, a maturity date in the first quarter of 2025, and an average fixed rate of 1.18 . A putable advance of 50 million was executed on September 30, 2024 with a four year final maturity with a one-time option for the FHLB to call the debt after a one-year lock out period and prepayment symmetry at a rate of 3.42 . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the ACL totaled 44.5 million and was comprised of an allowance for loan losses ALL of 43.7 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments RUC of 779,000 (included in Accrued interest and other liabilities ). This compares to the ACL of 42.4 million comprised of an ALL of 41.7 million and a RUC of 624,000 at June 30, 2024. The 2.1 million increase in the ACL for the third quarter of 2024 was due to a 3.3 million provision for credit losses, including higher specific reserves of 2.5 million, offset by net charge-offs of 1.2 million. The increase in specific reserves and charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in the estimated fair value of collateral-dependent loans, including estimated selling costs. Charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 were related to one C D loan and one CRE loan, which were written-down to their estimated fair value. The ALL as a percentage of loans HFI was 1.41 at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.37 at June 30, 2024. The ALL as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 72 at September 30, 2024, a decrease from 76 at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the ALL as a percentage of nonperforming loans was due in part to an increase in individually evaluated loans, which required no ALL. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, total shareholders' equity was 509.7 million, a 1.6 million decrease compared to June 30, 2024, and a 7.2 million increase compared to September 30, 2023. The decrease in shareholders' equity for the third quarter of 2024 was due to accretive common stock repurchases of 11.0 million and common stock cash dividends paid of 2.9 million, offset by net income of 7.0 million, lower net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities of 4.8 million and equity compensation activity of 527,000. Book value per share and tangible book value per share increased to 28.81 and 24.64 at September 30, 2024, up from 28.12 and 24.06 at June 30, 2024. For additional information, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures . 
 
 On February 29, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock. The repurchase program permitted shares to be repurchased in open market or private transactions, through block trades, and pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with SEC Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-8. The Company repurchased 508,275 shares at a weighted average share price of 21.53 during the third quarter of 2024 and completed the authorized program.

(1) 
 Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares adjusted for the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method. 

(2) 
 Return on average tangible common equity, tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures. See " Non-GAAP Financial Measures " for a reconciliation of these measures to their most comparable GAAP measures. 

(3) 
 Ratio calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income before provision for credit losses and noninterest income.

Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis 
 
 The principal component of our earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans, cash and investments (interest-earning assets) and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds (interest-bearing liabilities). Net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin. The net interest spread is the yield on average interest-earning assets minus the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin and net interest spread are included on a tax equivalent TE basis by adjusting interest income utilizing the federal statutory tax rate of 21 for 2024 and 2023. Our net interest income, interest spread, and net interest margin are sensitive to general business and economic conditions. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, monetary supply, and the strength of the international, national and state economies, in general, and more specifically, the local economies in which we conduct business. Our ability to manage net interest income during changing interest rate environments will have a significant impact on our overall performance. We manage net interest income through affecting changes in the mix of interest-earning assets as well as the mix of interest-bearing liabilities, changes in the level of interest-bearing liabilities in proportion to interest-earning assets, and in the growth and maturity of earning assets. For additional information see Capital Resources and Liquidity Management and Part I, Item 3. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk " included in this Report.

Net Interest Income/Average Balance Sheet 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 
 
 Net interest income was 24.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 24.0 million for the second quarter of 2024. The 580,000 increase was due to an increase in interest income of 1.5 million offset by an increase in interest expense of 959,000. The increase in interest income was due mostly to higher interest income on loans held for investment HFI of 2.0 million, partially offset by lower interest income on investment securities of 504,000. The increase in loan interest income was mostly due to higher average loans HFI of 54.4 million combined with a 9 basis point increase in the HFI loan yield. The decrease in investment income was attributed to lower average balances and a lower portfolio yield as proceeds from maturing short-term commercial paper were invested into loans and interest-earning cash. The increase in interest expense was due to higher average interest-bearing deposits of 42.3 million in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Net interest margin ("NIM") was 2.68 for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 1 basis point from 2.67 for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was due to a 5 basis point increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a 3 basis point increase in the overall cost of funds. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 5.94 for the third quarter of 2024 from 5.89 for the second quarter of 2024 due mainly to a 9 basis point increase in the yield on average loans HFI to 6.13 for the third quarter of 2024. The increase in the loan yield was largely attributed to nonaccrual loan activity in the current and prior quarter, including both the recapture of interest income for fully paid off nonaccrual loans and reversals of interest income for loans migrating to nonaccrual status. Such activity increased the third quarter loan yield by 1 basis point and decreased the second quarter loan yield by 7 basis points. Average loans represented 84 of average interest-earning assets in the third quarter of 2024, unchanged from the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 The overall cost of funds increased to 3.57 in the third quarter of 2024 from 3.54 in the second quarter of 2024 due to a higher average cost of interest-bearing deposits in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2024. The overall funding mix remained relatively unchanged from the second quarter of 2024 as the ratio of average noninterest-bearing deposits to average total funding sources remained relatively unchanged at 16 for the third and second quarters of 2024. The all-in spot rate for total deposits was 3.53 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net interest income was 24.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 27.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. The 3.0 million decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher interest expense of 1.9 million and lower interest income of 1.1 million. The increase in interest expense was due to higher average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, a lower percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits offset by lower average subordinated debt. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we redeemed 55.0 million of subordinated debt, which lowered interest expense by 899,000. Interest expense on deposits increased 2.8 million to 27.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 25.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to the increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 67.9 million decrease in average interest-bearing deposits. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 43.3 million to 528.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 571.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Average noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total average deposits was 17.3 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 18.1 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower average interest earning asset balances as compared to the same quarter last year, partially offset by higher yields on loans and interest earning deposits in other financial institutions. Average loans represented 84 of average interest-earning assets in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 83 in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in interest income was comprised of lower interest income on investment securities of 1.1 million and lower interest income on loans HFI of 301,000, partially offset by higher interest income on interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions of 195,000. The decrease in investment income was due to a 70.5 million decrease in average AFS securities combined with a lower average yield of 4.13 for the 2024 period from 4.50 for the 2023 period. The decrease in loans HFI interest income was primarily due to an 87.0 million decrease in average outstanding loan balances due to strategic loans sales and moderated loan production to improve the risk profile of the loan portfolio and strengthen overall on-balance sheet liquidity in response to market conditions during 2023. 
 
 NIM was 2.68 for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 19 basis points from 2.87 for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 39 basis point increase in the overall cost of funds, partially offset by a 16 basis point increase in the yield on interest earnings assets to 5.94 for the third quarter of 2024 from 5.78 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the yield on interest earning assets was due mainly to a 14 basis point increase in the yield on loans HFI to 6.13 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.99 for the third quarter of 2023. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 56 basis points due to increased market rates including the Federal Reserve raising the target Federal Funds Rate during 2023 and peer bank deposit competition. The Federal Funds Rate averaged 5.26 during the third quarter of 2024, unchanged from the same period in 2023. 
 
 Interest and fees on loans HFI for the third quarter of 2024 were 47.3 million compared to 47.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. The 301,000 decrease was primarily due to an 87.0 million decrease in the average outstanding balance of loans HFI. The decrease in the average loan balance was primarily due to strategic loans sales and moderated loan production to improve the risk profile of the loan portfolio and strengthen overall on-balance sheet liquidity in response to market conditions during 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the yield on loans HFI was 6.13 and 5.99 . 
 
 Interest expense on deposits increased to 27.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 25.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The 2.8 million increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to the increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 67.9 million decrease in average interest-bearing deposits. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 43.3 million to 528.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 571.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Average noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total average deposits was 17.3 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 18.1 for the third quarter of 2023.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net interest income was 73.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 93.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 20.2 million decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher interest expense of 16.0 million and lower interest income of 4.2 million. The increase in interest expense was due to higher average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, and a change in the mix of total deposits. 
 
 The increase in interest expense was due to higher average interest-bearing deposits, higher average rates paid on such deposits and the impact of a lower percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits, offset by lower average long-term debt. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we redeemed 55 million of subordinated debt, which lowered interest expense by 2.7 million. Interest expense on deposits increased 19.7 million to 82.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 62.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a 98 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits due to increases in market rates and peer competition combined with a 46.5 million increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances. Average interest-bearing deposits increased, in part, to help offset a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits as customers looked to higher yielding deposit products in response to higher market interest rates. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 96.2 million to 528.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 from 624.8 million for the first nine months of 2023. Average noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total average deposits was 17.3 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 20.1 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 The decrease in interest income was primarily due to a change in the mix of average interest-earning assets including lower average loan balances as compared to the same period last year. Average loans represented 83 of average interest-earning assets in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 86 in the first nine months of 2023. Interest and fees on loans HFI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 138.1 million compared to 148.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 10.3 million decrease was primarily due to a 222.7 million decrease in the average outstanding loan balances due to strategic loans sales and moderated loan production described above combined with a relatively unchanged yield on loans HFI year over year. 
 
 NIM was 2.68 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 63 basis points from 3.31 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 75 basis point increase in the total cost of funds, partially offset by a 4 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 98 basis points due to increased market rates including the Federal Reserve raising the target Federal Funds Rate 100 basis points between January 1, 2023 and July 31, 2023, and peer bank deposit competition. The weighted average Federal Funds Rate was 5.31 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 4.92 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 
 
 We recorded a 3.3 million provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a 557,000 provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2024. The third quarter provision increased due to a number of factors including (i) higher specific reserves on nonperforming loans of 2.5 million; (ii) net charge-offs of 1.2 million; and (iii) higher nonperforming and criticized loans, offset in part by modest improvements in the underlying economic conditions as of September 30, 2024. The increase in specific reserves and net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2024 was due to a decrease in the estimated fair value of collateral-dependent loans. Charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 were related to one C D loan and one CRE loan, which were written-down to their estimated fair value, less selling costs. The outlook for economic conditions including factors such as the interest rate environment and the forecast for GDP and unemployment rates have continued to generally improve in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 We recorded a provision for credit losses of 3.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a 1.4 million provision for the third quarter of 2023. The third quarter provision increased primarily due to higher specific reserves of 2.5 million and the impact of higher nonperforming and criticized loans, offset in part by the impact of modest improvements in the underlying economic conditions. The increase in specific reserves for the third quarter of 2024 was due to a decrease in the estimated fair value of collateral-dependent loans. There were 1.2 million in net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 2.2 million in net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2023. The outlook for economic conditions, including factors such as the interest rate environment and the forecast for GDP and unemployment rates have continued to generally improve in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the same quarter of 2023. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 We recorded a provision for credit losses of 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 3.8 million provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2024 included a provision for loan losses of 3.7 million and a provision for unfunded commitments of 139,000 compared to a provision for loan losses of 4.3 million, partially offset by a reversal of provision for unfunded commitments of 504,000 for the first nine months of 2023. The 579,000 decrease in the provision for loan losses year over year is due to the impact of an improvement in the outlook for economic conditions and interest rate environment, partially offset by higher charge-offs combined with higher specific reserves and higher levels of nonperforming and criticized loans as compared to the same period last year. During 2024, net loan charge-offs totaled 1.9 million and specific reserves have increased 2.4 million as compared to 2.9 million in charge-offs and no specific reserves for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 
 
 Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 17.4 million, an increase of 297,000 compared to 17.1 million for the second quarter of 2024. This increase was due to higher salaries and employee benefits expense of 475,000 due in part to higher loan production and higher other expenses of 304,000 due to higher loan related expense. These increases were partially offset by lower insurance and regulatory assessments of 323,000 and lower legal and professional expenses of 302,000, the latter being due to reimbursed legal costs from nonaccrual loan payoffs. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 17.4 million, an increase of 545,000 compared to 16.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. This increase was due to higher salaries and employee benefits expense of 264,000 due in part to higher loan production and higher other expenses of 369,000 due to higher loan related expense. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 51.5 million, a decrease of 2.8 million compared to 54.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to lower legal and professional expenses of 3.8 million due to a previously disclosed internal investigation that has been subsequently resolved and lower external auditor fees, partially offset by higher insurance and regulatory assessments of 578,000 mostly due to a higher FDIC assessment associated with the consent order issued in October 2023 and subsequently terminated in August 2024. These decreases were partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits expense of 533,000 due in part to higher loan production. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 
 
 We recorded an income tax provision of 2.6 million and 2.5 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 26.9 and 25.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. The effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate of 31 mostly due to utilizing a higher level of tax credits, including the benefits from Low-Income Housing Tax Credit ("LIHTC") investments and commitments to purchase Federal transferable tax credits. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 We recorded an income tax provision of 2.6 million and 3.6 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 26.9 and 29.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 was due in part to utilizing a higher level of tax credits. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 We recorded an income tax provision of 8.3 million and 12.8 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 27.2 and 29.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was due in part to utilizing a higher level of tax credits. 
 
 The higher level of tax credits was due to LIHTCs representing a higher portion of our pre-tax net income and the addition of new tax credits related mostly to commitments to purchase Federal transferable tax credits made available under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2023.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 Assets 
 
 At September 30, 2024, total assets were 4.0 billion, a decrease of 35.5 million, from total assets of 4.0 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to an 82.0 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a 13.3 million decrease in AFS investment securities, partially offset by a 60.0 million increase in gross loans HFI. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to a decrease of 258.3 million in wholesale deposits, offset by an increase in retail deposits and FHLB advances.

The weighted-average life on the total investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 was 5.3 years compared to a weighted-average life of 5.1 years at December 31, 2023. The increase in the weighted average life is due to a decrease in commercial paper, which generally has a 3 month term. The weighted-average life is the average number of years that each dollar of unpaid principal due remains outstanding. Average life is computed as the weighted-average time to the receipt of all future cash flows, using as the weights the dollar amounts of the principal pay-downs.

Table of Contents 

The table below shows our investment securities gross unrealized losses and estimated fair value by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The unrealized losses on these securities were primarily attributed to changes in interest rates. The issuers of these securities have not, to our knowledge, evidenced any cause for default on these securities. These securities have fluctuated in value since their purchase dates as market rates have fluctuated. However, we have the ability and the intention to hold these securities until their fair values recover to cost or maturity. As such, management does not deem these securities to be impaired under the current expected credit loss model. A summary of our analysis of these securities and the unrealized losses is described more fully in " Note 4 Investment Securities " of our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report. Economic trends may adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold.

Table of Contents 

There was no ACL on the HTM securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We monitor our securities portfolio to ensure all of our investments have adequate credit support and we consider the lowest credit rating for identification of potential credit impairment. As of September 30, 2024, we believe there was no impairment. In addition, we did not have the current intent to sell securities with a fair value below amortized cost at September 30, 2024, and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell such securities prior to the recovery of their amortized cost basis. As of September 30, 2024, all of our investment securities in an unrealized loss position received an investment grade credit rating. The overall net decreases in fair value during the period were attributable to a combination of changes in interest rates and market conditions. 

Loans 
 
 The loan portfolio is the largest category of our interest-earning assets. Total loans HFI increased 60.0 million, or 2.0 , to 3.09 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.03 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial real estate ("CRE") loans of 84.8 million, partially offset by decreases in SFR mortgages of 14.4 million, SBA loans of 4.0 million, C D loans of 1.3 million, C I loans of 1.2 million, and other loans of 3.9 million. In addition, mortgage loans held for sale ("HFS") decreased 1.1 million to 812,000 at September 30, 2024. SFR mortgage loans HFI represent approximately 48 of our total loans as of September 30, 2024 and 49 at December 31, 2023.

SFR Loans . As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.5 billion of SFR mortgage loans, representing 47.7 of our loans HFI portfolio. SFR mortgage loans decreased 14.4 million, or 1.0 , during the first nine months of 2024 due to higher payoffs and paydowns relative to originations. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average LTV of the portfolio was 55.8 , the weighted average FICO score was 763, and the average duration was 2.9 years. We originate qualified SFR mortgage loans and non-qualified, alternative documentation SFR mortgage loans through correspondent relationships and retail channels, including our branch network, to accommodate the needs of the Asian-centric market. The SFR loans HFI are generally originated through our retail branch network to our customers. The qualified SFR mortgage loans are 15-year and 30-year conforming mortgage loans and may be sold directly to FNMA and FHLMC. We originate non-qualified SFR mortgage loans both to sell and hold for investment. 
 
 There were 812,000 loans HFS as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.9 million loans HFS as of December 31, 2023. The loans sold to other banks are sold with no representations or warranties and have a replacement feature for the first 90-days if the loan pays off early. For SFR loans sold to FNMA, FHLMC and to investment funds we provide limited representations and warranties with a repurchase and premium refund for loans that become delinquent in the first 90-days or a premium refund if paid-off in the first 90-days. As a condition of the sale, the buyer must have the loans audited for underwriting and compliance standards.

Commercial and industrial loans. We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate C I loans. The loans are typically made to small- and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital needs, business expansions and for international trade financing. C I loans include lines of credit with a maturity of one year or less, commercial and industrial term loans with maturities of five years or less, shared national credits with maturities of five years or less, mortgage warehouse lines with a maturity of one year or less, purchased receivables with a maturity of two months or less and international trade discounts with a maturity of three months or less. Substantially all of our C I loans are collateralized by business assets or by real estate. 
 
 C I loans decreased 1.2 million, or 0.9 , to 128.9 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 130.1 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to decreases in mortgage warehouse lines and a decrease in usages of the credit lines due to increases in market rates of interest. The interest rate on these loans are generally Wall Street Journal Prime rate based. 
 
 SBA loans. We are designated a Preferred Lender under the SBA Preferred Lender Program. We offer mostly SBA 7(a) variable-rate loans. We generally sell the 75 guaranteed portion of the SBA loans that we originate. Our SBA loans are typically made to small-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail, hotel/motel and service businesses for working capital needs or business expansions. SBA loans can have any maturity up to 25 years. Typically, non-real estate secured loans mature in less than 10 years. Collateral may also include inventory, accounts receivable and equipment, and includes personal guarantees. 
 
 SBA loans decreased 4.0 million, or 7.7 , to 48.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 52.1 million at December 31, 2023. We originated SBA loans of 21.9 million during the first nine months of 2024. Offsetting these loan originations were loan sales of 9.8 million and net loan payoffs and paydowns of 16.1 million during the first nine months of 2024.

Loan Quality 
 
 We use what we believe is a comprehensive methodology to monitor credit quality and prudently manage credit concentration within our loan portfolio. Our underwriting policies and practices govern the risk profile and credit and geographic concentration for our loan portfolio. Our comprehensive methodology to monitor these credit quality standards includes a risk classification system that identifies potential problem loans based on risk characteristics by loan type as well as the early identification of deterioration at the individual loan level.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 We account for credit losses on loans in accordance with ASC 326, which requires us to record an estimate of expected lifetime credit losses for loans at the time of origination. The ACL for loans is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. Estimating expected credit losses requires management to use relevant forward-looking information, including the use of reasonable and supportable forecasts. The measurement of the ACL for loans is performed by collectively evaluating loans with similar risk characteristics. We have elected to utilize a discounted cash flow approach for all segments except consumer loans and warehouse mortgage loans, for these a remaining life approach was elected. 

57

Table of Contents 

Our discounted cash flow loss rate methodology incorporates a probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default to derive expected loss within the CECL model, as well as expectations of future economic conditions, using reasonable and supportable forecasts. We use both internal and external qualitative factors within the CECL model including: lending policies, procedures, and strategies; changes in nature and volume of the portfolio; credit and lending personnel experience; changes in volume and trends in classified, delinquent, and nonaccrual loans; concentration risk; collateral values; regulatory and business environment; loan review results; and economic conditions. 
 
 Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience from peers with similar asset sizes and geographic locations to the Company. The nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations, changes in credit quality and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors are also considered. Our CECL methodology utilizes a four-quarter reasonable and supportable forecast period, and a four-quarter reversion period. We use the Federal Open Market Committee forecasts for the national unemployment rate, while reverting to historical loss information. 
 
 Our annual model assumption refresh was completed in the third quarter of 2024 for the quantitative and qualitative CECL models. Updates included incorporating the most recent twelve months of peer loss history, prepayment and curtailment rates and a review of recovery lags applied in the model. With the annual refresh in the third quarter of 2024 we observed a slowdown in prepayment rates applied in the models and an increase in the proportion of the quantitative reserve compared to the qualitative reserve. Management reviews assumptions quarterly including those applied with the annual refresh. 
 
 Individual loans considered to be uncollectible are charged off against the ACL. Factors used in determining the amount and timing of charge-offs on loans include consideration of the loan type, length of delinquency, sufficiency of collateral value, lien priority and the overall financial condition of the borrower. Loans deemed to be collateral-dependent are reviewed individually based on the estimated fair value of the collateral less selling costs. Collateral value is determined using appraisals and/or other market comparable information. Charge-offs are generally taken on loans once the impairment is determined to be probable. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the ACL. Net charge-offs to average loans HFI were 0.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.10 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The ACL was 44.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 42.5 million at December 31, 2023. The 1.9 million increase in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to a 3.9 million provision for credit losses, offset by net charge-offs of 1.9 million. The provision for credit losses took into consideration factors including changes in the loan portfolio mix, ongoing uncertainty in the economy related to inflation and the outlook for market interest rates, and credit quality metrics, including a 29.0 million increase in nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.

Problem Loans. Loans are considered delinquent when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more; delinquent loans may remain on accrual status between 30 days and 89 days past due. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans. Typically, the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or when, in the opinion of management, there is a reasonable doubt as to collectability in the normal course of business. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Income on nonaccrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the loan s principal balance is deemed collectible. Loans are restored to accrual status when loans become well-secured and management believes full collectability of principal and interest is probable. 
 
 In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and we make certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is classified as a modified loan. These concessions may include a reduction of the interest rate, principal or accrued interest, extension of the maturity date or other actions intended to minimize potential losses. Loans modified at a rate equal to or greater than that of a new loan with comparable risk at the time the loan is modified may be excluded from modified loan disclosures in years subsequent to the modification if the loans are in compliance with their modified terms. 
 
 Real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure is recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis (carrying value) by a charge to the allowance for credit losses, if necessary, or a gain recognized through noninterest income, as appropriate. Once classified as an OREO, it is subsequently carried at the lower of our carrying value of the property or its fair value. Fair value is based on current appraisals less estimated selling costs. Any subsequent write-downs are charged against operating expenses and recognized as a valuation allowance. Operating expenses and related income of such properties are included in other operating income and expenses. Gains on transfer of loans to OREO, and gains or losses on their disposition are included in gain on OREO. 
 
 The following table sets forth the allocation of our nonperforming assets among our different asset categories as of the dates indicated. Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest (of which there were none during the periods presented), and modified loans. The balances of nonperforming loans reflect the net investment in these assets.

Nonperforming loans totaled 60.7 million, or 1.52 of total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared to 31.6 million, or 0.79 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The 29.0 million increase in nonperforming loans was due to 43.8 million of loans migrating to nonaccrual, offset by payoffs and paydowns of 12.4 million, charge-offs of 1.4 million and loans that migrated back to accruing status of 1.0 million. The 43.8 million of loans which migrated to nonaccrual in 2024 consisted mainly of two C D loans totaling 20.0 million, two CRE loans totaling 10.5 million, C I loans totaling 6.2 million and SFR loans totaling 6.4 million. 
 
 Our 30-89 day delinquent loans, excluding nonperforming loans, decreased 6.2 million to 10.6 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 16.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in past due loans was due to 6.6 million in loans that migrated to nonaccrual, 3.6 million in loans that migrated back to past due for less than 30 days, 2.4 million in loan payoffs or paydowns and 73,000 in past due loan charge-offs, offset by 6.5 million in new delinquent loans.

We did not recognize any interest income on nonaccrual loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, while the loans were in nonaccrual status. 
 
 We utilize an asset risk classification system in compliance with guidelines established by the FDIC as part of our efforts to improve asset quality. In connection with examinations of insured institutions, examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, classify them. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful, and loss. Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full questionable and there is a high probability of loss based on currently existing facts, conditions and values. An asset classified as loss is not considered collectable and is of such little value that continuance as an asset is not warranted. 
 
 We use a risk grading system to categorize and determine the credit risk of our loans. Potential problem loans include loans with a risk grade of 6, which are special mention, loans with a risk grade of 7, which are substandard loans that are generally not considered to be impaired and loans with a risk grade of 8, which are doubtful loans generally considered to be impaired. These loans generally require more frequent loan officer contact and receipt of financial data to closely monitor borrower performance. Potential problem loans are managed and monitored regularly through a number of processes, procedures and committees, including oversight by a loan administration committee comprised of executive officers and other members of the Bank s senior management.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill was 71.5 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets, which consist of core deposit intangibles, were 2.2 million and 2.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These core deposit intangible assets are amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives, generally over a period of 8 to 10 years. 
 
 Liabilities. Total liabilities decreased by 34.0 million to 3.5 billion at September 30, 2024 from 3.5 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to an 82.6 million decrease in deposits. This decrease was due to a decrease in interest-bearing deposits of 86.6 million, offset by an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits of 4.0 million. The decrease in interest-bearing deposits included a decrease in time deposits of 119.9 million, offset by an increase in non-maturity deposits of 33.4 million. The decrease in time deposits since 2023 year end included a 258.3 million decrease in wholesale deposits.

We acquire deposits through wholesale channels including brokered deposits, collateralized deposits from the State of California, and internet listing services as needed to supplement liquidity. The total amount of such deposits was 147.3 million at September 30, 2024 and 405.6 million at December 31, 2023. Brokered time deposits were 88.6 million at September 30, 2024 and 254.9 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 In addition, we offer deposit products through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS and Insured Cash Sweeps ICS programs where customers are able to achieve FDIC insurance for balances on deposit in excess of the 250,000 FDIC limit. Time deposits held through the CDARS program were 133.4 million at September 30, 2024 and 135.7 million at December 31, 2023 and ICS deposits totaled 135.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 109.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in the participation in these programs is due to our focus on enhancing liquidity in recent periods.

FHLB Borrowings. In addition to deposits, we have used long- and short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased and FHLB long-and short-term advances, as a source of funds to meet the daily liquidity needs of our customers and fund growth in earning assets. We had no FHLB overnight advances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We had 200.0 million in FHLB advances at September 30, 2024 and 150 million at December 31, 2023. Advances totaling 150 million had an original term of five years, a maturity date in the first quarter of 2025, and an average fixed interest rate of 1.18 . A putable advance of 50 million was executed at September 30, 2024 with a four year final maturity, a one year no-put option (European one time) and prepayment symmetry at a rate of 3.42 .

Long-term Debt. Long-term debt consists of subordinated notes. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of subordinated notes outstanding was 119.4 million as compared to 119.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 In March 2021, we issued 120.0 million of 4.00 fixed to floating rate subordinated notes due April 1, 2031 (the 2031 Subordinated Notes ). The interest rate is fixed through April 1, 2026 and floats at three month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 329 basis points thereafter. We can redeem the 2031 Subordinated Notes beginning April 1, 2026. The 2031 Subordinated Notes are considered Tier 2 capital at the Company. 
 
 Subordinated Debentures. Subordinated debentures consist of subordinated debentures issued in connection with three separate trust preferred securities and totaled 15.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and 14.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Under the terms of our subordinated debentures issued in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities, we are not permitted to declare or pay any dividends on our capital stock if an event of default occurs under the terms of the long-term debt.

Capital Resources and Liquidity Management 
 
 Capital Resources. Shareholders equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, sales, repurchases of common stock and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, from AFS investment securities. 
 
 Shareholders equity decreased 1.5 million, or 0.30 , to 509.7 million as of September 30, 2024 since December 31, 2023. The decrease in shareholders' equity for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was due to accretive common stock repurchases of 20.7 million and dividends paid of 8.9 million, partially offset by net earnings of 22.3 million, higher net after tax unrealized losses on AFS securities of 3.4 million and 2.3 million from stock option and other equity award activity. As a result, book value per share increased to 28.81 from 27.47 at December 31, 2023 and tangible book value per share increased to 24.64 from 23.48 at December 31, 2023. For additional information, see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
 
 Liquidity Management. Liquidity refers to the measure of our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements as well as expected and unexpected cash needs. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. 
 
 Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Liquid assets include cash, interest-earning deposits in banks, federal funds sold, available for sale securities, purchased receivables and maturing or prepaying balances in our securities and loan portfolios. Liquid liabilities include core deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other borrowings. Other sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market non-core deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, additional borrowings through the Federal Reserve s discount window and the issuance of preferred or common securities. Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations, including payment of interest on deposits and debt, extensions of credit to borrowers, capital expenditures and shareholder dividends. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan and investment portfolios, debt financing and increases in customer deposits. For additional information regarding our operating, investing and financing cash flows, see the consolidated statements of cash flows provided in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Integral to our liquidity management is the administration of short-term borrowings. To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, we seek to meet our liquidity needs through wholesale funding or other borrowings on either a short- or long-term basis. Our wholesale funding ratio was 4.3 at September 30, 2024 compared to 11.7 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 We have sufficient capital and do not anticipate any need for additional liquidity as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had 92.0 million of federal funds lines, of which 80.0 million is unsecured and 12.0 million is collateralized by investment securities with fair market value of 20.5 million, with no amounts advanced against the lines. At December 31, 2023, we had 92.0 million of unsecured fed funds line, with no advances drawn. In addition, lines of credit from the Federal Reserve Discount Window were 47.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 42.3 million at December 31, 2023. Federal Reserve Discount Window lines were collateralized by a pool of CRE loans totaling 63.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and 62.8 million as of December 31, 2023. We did not have any borrowings outstanding with the Federal Reserve at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and our borrowing capacity is limited only by eligible collateral. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 150.0 million in FHLB term advances outstanding which mature in the first quarter of 2025 and a 50.0 million FHLB putable advance, which matures in the third quarter of 2028. The 50.0 million putable advance was executed on September 30, 2024, with a four-year final maturity with a one-time option for the FHLB to call the debt after a one-year lock out period and prepayment symmetry at a rate of 3.42 . Based on the values of loans pledged as collateral, we had 766.7 million of remaining secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB as of September 30, 2024 and 888.3 million at December 31, 2023.

RBB is a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, must provide for its own liquidity. RBB s main source of funding is dividends declared and paid to RBB by the Bank and RAM. There are statutory, regulatory and debt covenant limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to RBB. Management believes that these limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations. At September 30, 2024, RBB had 34.6 million in cash, of which 33.3 million was on deposit at the Bank. 
 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 
 We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators. Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (described below), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. 
 
 Final comprehensive regulatory capital rules for U.S. banking organizations pursuant to the capital framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, generally referred to as Basel III, implemented a requirement for all banking organizations to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 above the minimum risk-based capital requirements, which fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is exclusively comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not to the leverage ratio. At September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank were in compliance with the capital conservation buffer requirements. If the capital adequacy minimum ratios plus the phased-in conservation buffer amount exceed actual risk-weighted capital ratios, then dividends, share buybacks, and discretionary bonuses to executives could be limited in amount. 
 
 The table below summarizes the minimum capital requirements applicable to RBB and the Bank pursuant to Basel III regulations. The minimum capital requirements are only regulatory minimums and banking regulators can impose higher requirements on individual institutions. For example, banks and bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions generally will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels. Higher capital levels may also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. The table below summarizes the capital requirements applicable to RBB and the Bank in order to be considered well-capitalized from a regulatory perspective, as well as the capital ratios of RBB and the Bank as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. RBB and the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under Basel III and the Bank was considered to be well-capitalized as of the dates reflected in the table below:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We have limited off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into financial commitments to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial commitments include commitments to extend credit, unused lines of credit, commercial and similar letters of credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve to varying degrees of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the ACL in the consolidated balance sheets. Such off-balance sheet commitments totaled 182.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and 190.7 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance on these financial commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for loans reflected in our financial statements. 
 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each client s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Company is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
 
 In addition, we invest in various affordable housing partnerships and Small Business Investment Company ("SBIC") funds. Pursuant to these investments, we commit to an investment amount to be fulfilled in future periods. Such unfunded commitments totaled 6.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and 3.3 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Some of the financial measures included herein are not measures of financial performance recognized by GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, tangible book value per share, and return on average tangible common equity. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in our analysis of our performance. 
 
 Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets Ratio and Tangible Book Value Per Share. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP measures generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate capital adequacy. We calculate: (i) tangible common equity as total shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights); (ii) tangible assets as total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights); and (iii) tangible book value per share as tangible common equity divided by period end shares of common stock outstanding.

Table of Contents 

Our management, banking regulators, many financial analysts and other investors use these measures in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, which typically stem from the use of the purchase method of accounting for mergers and acquisitions. Tangible common equity, tangible assets, tangible book value per share and related measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total shareholders equity, total assets, book value per share or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate tangible common equity, tangible assets, tangible book value per share and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. The following table reconciles shareholders equity (on a GAAP basis) to tangible common equity and total assets (on a GAAP basis) to tangible assets, and calculates our tangible book value per share:

Return on Average Tangible Common Equity. Management measures return on average tangible common equity ROATCE to assess our capital strength and business performance. Tangible equity excludes goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), and is reviewed by banking and financial institution regulators when assessing a financial institution s capital adequacy. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following table reconciles ROATCE to its most comparable GAAP measure:

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market Risk. Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, equity prices, and credit spreads. We have identified three primary sources of market risk: interest rate risk, price risk and basis risk. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricing and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (repricing risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and SOFR (basis risk). 
 
 Price Risk. Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from the available for sale SFR mortgage loans and fixed-rate available for sale securities. 
 
 Basis Risk. Basis risk represents the risk of loss arising from asset and liability pricing movements not changing in the same direction. We have basis risk primarily in the SFR mortgage loan portfolio, the multifamily loan portfolio and our securities portfolio. 
 
 Our ALCO establishes broad policy limits with respect to interest rate risk. The ALCO establishes specific operating guidelines within the parameters of the board of directors policies. In general, we seek to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the economic values of assets and liabilities. The ALCO monitors the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure compliance with the board of directors approved risk limits and to oversee management's balance sheet risk management strategies. 
 
 Interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and policy constraints. 
 
 An asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which a short-term decrease in interest rates is expected to generate lower net interest income, as rates earned on interest-earning assets would reprice downward more quickly than rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, thus compressing the net interest margin. Conversely, a liability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which a short-term decrease in interest rates is expected to generate higher net interest income, as rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities would reprice downward more quickly than rates earned on interest-earning assets, thus expanding the net interest margin. 
 
 Income Simulation and Economic Value Analysis. Interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the board and the ALCO at least quarterly. The information reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk.

Table of Contents 

We use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net Interest Income at Risk (NII at Risk), and Economic Value of Equity EVE ). Under NII at Risk, net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets, liabilities, and derivatives over a 12 month time horizon assuming a flat balance sheet and an instantaneous and parallel shift in market interest rates in 100 basis point increments. We report NII at Risk to isolate the change in income related solely to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The model results do not take into consideration any steps management might take to respond to the changes in interest rates or changes in competitor or customer behavior. EVE measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. EVE is a period end measurement.

As of September 30, 2024, our NII at Risk profile is liability sensitive in the down and up rate scenarios. This is directionally consistent with our profile at December 31, 2023 for the down rate and a change from neutral in the up rate scenario. For the up rate scenarios, we are more liability sensitive due to fixed rate debt approaching its maturity date in the first quarter of 2025. Actual results could vary materially from those calculated by our model, due to a variety of factors or assumptions such as the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movement or the shape of the yield curve. The NII at Risk results are within board policy limits.

The EVE at September 30, 2024 indicates that the EVE position is expected to generally decrease in both the up and down rate scenarios. When interest rates rise, fixed rate assets generally lose economic value as these assets are discounted at a higher rate demonstrating the longer duration assets result in greater value to be lost. When interest rates fall, the opposite is true, however these positives are offset by a decrease in the value of noninterest-bearing deposits, which have a lower value in lower interest rate environments. Actual results could vary materially from those calculated by our model, due to a variety of factors or assumptions such as the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movement or the shape of the yield curve. The EVE results are within board policy limits.
