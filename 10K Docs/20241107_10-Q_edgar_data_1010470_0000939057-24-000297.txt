The Corporation held investments with an unrealized loss position of million at September 30, 2024 and million at June 30, 2024 as follows: U.S. government sponsored enterprise CMO U.S. SBA securities Total investment securities - held to maturity Available for sale U.S government agency MBS Private issue CMO Total investment securities - available for sale Total investment securities

 U.S. government sponsored enterprise CMO U.S. SBA securities Total investment securities - held to maturity Available for sale U.S government agency MBS U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS Private issue CMO Total investment securities - available for sale Total investment securities The Corporation evaluates individual investment securities quarterly for impairment based on the adoption of ASC 326 on July 1, 2023. At September 30, 2024, most of the million of unrealized holding losses were in a loss position for 12 months or more, except of unrealized holding losses were in a loss position for less than 12 months; while at June 30, 2024, all million of unrealized holding losses were in a loss position for 12 months or more. The unrealized losses on investment securities were attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities, which are predominately U.S. government sponsored enterprise securities that are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and have a long history of credit losses. Therefore, the Corporation has determined that the unrealized losses are due to the fluctuating nature of interest rates, and not related to any potential credit risks within the investment portfolio. The Bank does not currently intend to sell any investment securities classified as held to maturity recorded at amortized cost or available for sale recorded at fair market value as prescribed by GAAP. As a part of the Corporation s monthly risk assessment, the Corporation runs a number of stressed liquidity scenarios to determine if it is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investment securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. These liquidity scenarios support the Corporation s assessment that the Corporation has the ability to hold these held to maturity securities until maturity or available for sale securities until recovery of the amortized cost is realized and it is not more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost. There was allowance for credit losses ACL on or impairment of investment securities held to maturity and there was impairment of investment securities available for sale at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. In order to maintain adequate liquidity, the Bank has established borrowing facilities with various counterparties. The Bank had a remaining borrowing capacity of million as of September 30, 2024 at the FHLB of San Francisco. In addition, the Bank has secured an estimated million discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco collateralized by investment securities totaling million and loans held for investment totaling million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank also has an unsecured borrowing arrangement in the form of a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for million. The Bank had advances under the Federal Reserve discount window or correspondent bank facility as of September 30, 2024. The total remaining available borrowing capacity across all sources totaled approximately million at September 30, 2024. At June 30, 2024, the Bank had a remaining borrowing capacity of million at the FHLB of San Francisco. In addition, the Bank had secured an estimated million discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco collateralized by investment securities totaling million and loans held for investment totaling million at June 30, 2024.

The total remaining available borrowing capacity across all sources totaled approximately million at June 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation did not hold any investment securities held to maturity or investment securities available for sale with the intent to sell and determined it had the ability to hold these investment securities until maturity. It also determined that it was more likely than not that the Corporation would not be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.

 The Corporation has developed an internal loan grading system to evaluate and quantify loans held for investment with respect to quality and risk. Management continually evaluates the credit quality of the loan portfolio and conducts a quarterly review of the adequacy of the ACL. The Corporation has adopted an internal risk rating policy in which each loan is rated for credit quality with a rating of pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. The two primary components that are used during the loan review process to determine the proper allowance levels are individually evaluated allowances and collectively evaluated allowances. The collectively evaluated allowance is based on a pooling method for groups of homogeneous loans sharing similar loan characteristics to calculate an allowance which reflects an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses using historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Loans identified to be individually evaluated have an allowance that is based upon the appraised value of the collateral, less selling costs or discounted cash flow with an appropriate default factor. The Corporation categorizes all loans held for investment into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of the borrower to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. A description of the general characteristics of the risk grades is as follows: Pass A pass loan ranges from minimal credit risk to average, but still acceptable, credit risk. The likelihood of loss is considered remote. Special Mention - A special mention loan has potential weaknesses that may be temporary or, if left uncorrected, may result in a loss. While concerns exist, the Corporation is currently protected and loss is considered unlikely and not imminent. Substandard - A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or

 loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Management believes the ACL on loans held for investment is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for expected losses on the Corporation s loans held for investment based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The provision for (recovery of) credit losses is charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly basis, as necessary, to maintain the ACL at appropriate levels. Future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected as a result of economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions beyond the Corporation s control. Non-performing loans are charged-off to their fair market values in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed uncollectible, generally after the loan becomes delinquent for real estate secured first trust deed loans and delinquent for commercial business or real estate secured second trust deed loans. For loans that were previously modified from their original terms, were re-underwritten and identified as modified loans, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes delinquent; and where borrowers file bankruptcy, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes delinquent. The amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less disposition costs, with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the ACL. For modified loans that are less than delinquent, the ACL is segregated into (a) individually evaluated allowances for those loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations still in their modification period, classified lower than pass, and containing an embedded loss component or (b) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing loans less than delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy, the collectively evaluated allowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing commercial real estate loans, an individually evaluated allowance is derived based on the loan's discounted cash flow fair value (for modified loans) or collateral fair value less estimated selling costs and if the fair value is higher than the loan balance, allowance is required. A non-performing loan can be restored to accrual status when a borrower is current in payments for six consecutive months.

 With related ACL: Mortgage loans: Single-family Total During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, properties were acquired in the settlement of loans and previously foreclosed upon properties were sold. A new appraisal is obtained on each of the properties at the time of foreclosure and fair value is derived by using the lower of the appraised value or the listing price of the property, net of selling costs. Any initial loss upon repossession is recorded as a charge to the ACL before being transferred to real estate owned. Subsequent to transfer to real estate owned, if there is further deterioration in real estate values, specific real estate owned loss reserves are established and charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, the Corporation records costs to carry real estate owned as real estate owned operating expenses as incurred. As of both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, there was no real estate owned property. The Bank adjusts the reserve for unfunded loan commitments through the provision for (recovery of) credit losses. The following table provides information regarding the unfunded loan commitment reserve for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Provision for credit losses Balance, end of the period The method for calculating the unfunded commitment reserve is based on a historical funding rate applied to the undisbursed loan amount to estimate an average outstanding amount during the life of the loan commitment. The Corporation applies the same assumptions and methodologies by loan groupings to these unfunded loan commitments as it does for its funded loans held for investment to determine the reserve rate and the allowance. Assumptions are evaluated by management periodically as part of the CECL procedures. The unfunded loan commitment reserve is recorded in Accounts payable, accrued interest and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

The following table provides information regarding unfunded loan commitments, which are comprised of undisbursed funds on construction loans, undisbursed funds to borrowers on existing lines of credit with the Corporation and commitments to originate loans to be held for investment at the dates indicated below. Undisbursed lines of credit Mortgage loans Undisbursed lines of credit Commercial business loans Undisbursed lines of credit Consumer loans Commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for investment Total In accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and interpretations of the Derivatives Implementation Group of the FASB, the fair value of the commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale, loan sale commitments, to be announced TBA MBS trades, put option contracts and call option contracts are recorded at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Corporation does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments; therefore, all changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, there were outstanding derivative financial instruments. Loans previously sold to the FHLB San Francisco under the Mortgage Partnership Finance MPF program have a recourse liability. The FHLB San Francisco absorbs the first basis points of loss by establishing a first loss account and a credit scoring process is used to calculate the maximum recourse amount for the Bank. All losses above the Bank s maximum recourse amount are the responsibility of the FHLB San Francisco. The FHLB San Francisco pays the Bank a credit enhancement fee monthly to compensate the Bank for accepting the recourse obligation. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Bank serviced million and million of loans under this program, respectively, and has established a recourse liability of and , respectively. Occasionally, the Bank is required to repurchase loans sold to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or other investors if it is determined that such loans do not meet the credit requirements of the investor, or if one of the parties involved in the loan misrepresented pertinent facts, committed fraud, or if such loans were 90-days past due within 120 days of the loan funding date. During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank did t repurchase any loans or settle any request to repurchase a loan. In addition to the specific recourse liability for the MPF program, the Bank established a recourse liability of and for loans sold to other investors at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.

 ) As of June 30, 2024: Loans held for investment, at fair value ) ASC 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. The three levels of inputs are defined as follows: Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated to observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Valuation techniques may include the use of discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that use significant assumptions, including assumptions of risks. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Corporation s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. ASC 820 requires the Corporation to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation. The Corporation s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of investment securities available for sale, loans held for investment at fair value, other equity investments and interest-only strips; while loans with individually evaluated allowances and mortgage servicing assets MSA are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Investment securities - available for sale are primarily comprised of U.S. government agency MBS, U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS and private issue CMO. The Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar securities for its fair value measurement of MBS (Level 2) and broker price indications for similar securities in non-active markets for its fair value measurement of the private issue CMO (Level 3).

A decrease to the unobservable input would have the opposite effect. Significant changes in these inputs in isolation could result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation s assets and liabilities include the following: prepayment speeds, discount rates and broker quotes, among others. Significant increases or decreases in any of these inputs in isolation could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The various unobservable inputs used to determine valuations may have similar or diverging impacts on valuation. The carrying amount and fair value of the Corporation s other financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was as follows: Investment securities - held to maturity FHLB San Francisco stock Financial liabilities: Deposits Borrowings 

 29 

Table of Contents 
 Investment securities - held to maturity FHLB San Francisco stock Financial liabilities: Deposits Borrowings Loans held for investment, not recorded at fair value: For loans that reprice frequently at market rates, the carrying amount approximates the fair value. For fixed-rate loans, the fair value is determined by either (i) discounting the estimated future cash flows of such loans over their estimated remaining contractual maturities using a current interest rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers, or (ii) quoted market prices. Investment securities - held to maturity: The investment securities - held to maturity consist of U.S. SBA securities, U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS and U.S. government sponsored enterprise CMO. For the U.S. SBA securities and U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS and CMO, the Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar securities for its fair value measurement. FHLB San Francisco stock: The carrying amount reported for FHLB San Francisco stock approximates fair value. When redeemed, the Corporation will receive an amount equal to the par value of the stock. Deposits: The fair value of time deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate is based upon observable inputs, including rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of transaction accounts (checking, money market and savings accounts) is equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. Borrowings: The fair value of borrowings has been estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate on such borrowings is based upon rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities. The Corporation has various processes and controls in place to ensure that fair value is reasonably estimated. The Corporation generally determines fair value of their Level 3 assets and liabilities by using internally developed models which primarily utilize discounted cash flow techniques and prices obtained from independent management services or brokers. The Corporation performs due diligence procedures over third-party pricing service providers in order to support their use in the valuation process. While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, there were no significant changes to the Corporation s valuation techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations.

 Executive Summary and Operating Strategy Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B., established in 1956, is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid-sized businesses in the Inland Empire region of Southern California. The Bank conducts its business operations as Provident Bank and through its subsidiary, Provident Financial Corp. The business activities of the Corporation, primarily through the Bank, consist of community banking and, to a lesser degree, investment services for customers and trustee services on behalf of the Bank. Community banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding the Corporation s full service offices and investing those funds in single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Also, to a lesser extent, the Corporation makes construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans. The primary source of income in community banking is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds. Additionally, certain fees are collected from depositors, such as returned check fees, deposit account service charges, ATM fees, IRA/KEOGH fees, safe deposit box fees, wire transfer fees and overdraft protection fees, among others. The Corporation plans to enhance its community banking business by moderately increasing its total assets, focusing on expanding single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction, and commercial business loans. Additionally, the Corporation aims to reduce the percentage of retail time deposits in its deposit base while increasing the proportion of lower-cost checking and savings accounts. To diversify its deposit instruments, the Corporation will consider utilizing brokered certificates of deposit and the State of California s time deposits, subject to market conditions and its funding needs. This strategy is designed to improve core revenue by achieving a higher net interest margin and, combined with the Corporation s growth, ultimately increase net interest income. While the Corporation s long-term strategy targets moderate growth, management acknowledges that this growth may be influenced by general economic conditions and other factors. Investment services operations primarily consist of selling alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds to the Bank s depositors. Provident Financial Corp PFC performs trustee services for the Bank s real estate secured loan transactions and has in the past held, and may in the future hold, real estate for investment. Investment services and trustee services contribute a very small percentage of gross revenue. There are a number of risks associated with the business activities of the Corporation, many of which are beyond the Corporation s control as described in the Corporation s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation attempts to mitigate many of these risks through prudent banking practices, such as interest rate risk management, credit risk management, operational risk management, and liquidity risk management. The California economic environment presents heightened risk for the Corporation primarily with respect to real estate values and loan delinquencies. Since the majority of the Corporation s loans are secured by real estate located within California, significant declines in the value of California real estate may also inhibit the Corporation s ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate. The commercial real estate environment, particularly office space of various types, currently presents elevated risk within the banking industry. In response, the Bank has reviewed its existing loans collateralized by office space for any outsized exposure and implemented tighter underwriting standards for this collateral type. At September 30, 2024, our commercial real estate portfolio totaled 81.2 million, including office space of various types, totaling approximately 41.3 million or 50.9 percent of the total commercial real estate portfolio and 3.9 percent of the total loan portfolio. Commitments and Derivative Financial Instruments The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, in the form of originating loans or providing funds under existing lines of credit, loan sale agreements to third parties and option contracts. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Corporation s exposure to credit loss, in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to these financial instruments, is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. The Corporation uses the same credit policies in entering into financial instruments with off-

 balance sheet risk as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. For a discussion on commitments and derivative financial instruments, see Note 6 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 Total assets decreased one percent to 1.26 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.27 billion at June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and loans held for investment. Total cash and cash equivalents, primarily excess cash deposited with the FRB of San Francisco, decreased 3.2 million, or six percent, to 48.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 51.4 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in total cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to deposit outflows and management s proactive strategy to manage liquidity based upon recent economic conditions. Investment securities (held to maturity and available for sale) decreased 5.8 million, or four percent, to 126.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 131.9 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily the result of scheduled and accelerated principal payments on mortgage-backed and other securities during the first three months of fiscal 2025, with no purchases of investment securities during the period. For further analysis on investment securities, see Note 4 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. Loans held for investment decreased 4.3 million, less than one percent, to 1.05 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.05 billion at June 30, 2024, predominantly due to declines in multi-family and commercial real estate loans, partly offset by an increase in single-family loans. During the first three months of fiscal 2025, the Corporation originated 28.9 million of loans held for investment, consisting primarily of single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans located throughout California. The Corporation did not purchase any loans during the first three months of fiscal 2025. Total loan principal payments during the first three months of fiscal 2025 were 34.0 million, up 48 percent from 23.0 million during the comparable period in fiscal 2024. Single-family loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 totaled 524.2 million and 518.1 million, representing approximately 50 percent and 49 percent of loans held for investment, respectively. Multi-family loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 totaled 435.8 million and 445.2 million, respectively, representing approximately 42 percent of loans held for investment at both dates. Commercial real estate loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 totaled 81.2 million and 83.3 million, respectively, representing approximately eight percent of loans held for investment at both dates. The tables below describe the geographic dispersion of gross real estate secured loans held for investment at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, as a percentage of the total dollar amount of loans outstanding: As of September 30, 2024:

Total deposits decreased 24.4 million, or three percent, to 863.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 888.3 million at June 30, 2024, due to decreases in all account categories, except money market accounts. The decrease in total deposits was primarily due to customers seeking higher interest rates as competition for deposits in our market area remains strong. Total uninsured deposits were approximately 124.2 million and 122.7 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The amounts of uninsured deposits are based on estimated amounts of uninsured deposits as of the reported period. Such estimates are based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting requirements. Transaction account balances or core deposits decreased 14.8 million, or two percent, to 599.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 614.5 million at June 30, 2024, while time deposits decreased 9.7 million, or four percent, to 264.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 273.9 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in time deposits was due to primarily the decline in retail time deposits. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, total brokered certificates of deposit were 129.8 million and 131.8 million, respectively. Excluding brokered certificates of deposit, the percentage of time deposits to total deposits was 18 percent and 19 percent at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Total borrowings increased 11.0 million, or five percent, to 249.5.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 238.5 million at June 30, 2024. The increase in borrowings was primarily to augment the decrease in total deposits. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, borrowings were comprised of short-term and long-term FHLB - San Francisco advances used for liquidity and interest rate risk management purposes. Total stockholders equity declined slightly to 129.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 129.9 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to 961,000 of cash dividends paid to shareholders and 1.5 million of stock repurchases, partly offset by net income of 1.9 million in the first three months of fiscal 2025 and the amortization of stock-based compensation of 173,000. The Corporation repurchased 93,641 shares of its common stock in the open market at a weighted average cost of 14.26 per share during the first three months of fiscal 2025 pursuant to its publicly announced stock repurchase program. In addition, the Corporation acquired 8,758 shares of Corporation common stock at a cost of 13.24 per share in settlement of employees' withholding tax obligations related to the vesting of restricted stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Comparison of Operating Results for the Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 1.9 million, up 138,000 or eight percent from 1.8 million in the same period of fiscal 2024. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a 697,000 recovery of credit losses in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (in contrast to a 545,000 provision for credit losses in the same quarter last year) and a 148,000 increase in non-interest income, partly offset by a 667,000 increase in non-interest expense and a 523,000 decrease in net interest income.

 The efficiency ratio, defined as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, was 79.06 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to 69.32 percent in the same period last year. The deterioration of the efficiency ratio during the current quarter compared to the same period last year was due both to higher non-interest expenses and a lower net interest income. Return on average assets was 0.61 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up seven basis points from 0.54 percent in the same period last year. Return on average stockholders equity was 5.78 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up from 5.40 percent in the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were 0.28, up 12 percent from 0.25 in the same period last year. Net Interest Income: Net interest income decreased 523,000 or six percent to 8.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 9.1 million for the same quarter last year. The decrease in net interest income was due to a lower average balance of interest-earning assets and, to a lesser extent, a lower net interest margin. The average balance of interest-earning assets decreased 54.7 million, or four percent, to 1.22 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 1.27 billion the same quarter last year as the average balances of investment securities, loans receivable and interest-earning deposits all declined. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 51.3 million, or four percent, to 1.10 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 1.15 billion in the same quarter last year primarily reflecting the decrease in the average balance of deposits. The lower net interest margin was due to the increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities which exceeded the increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The net interest margin during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased four basis points to 2.84 percent from 2.88 percent in the same quarter last year. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 43 basis points to 4.63 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 4.20 percent in the same quarter last year, while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 52 basis points to 1.97 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 1.45 percent in the same quarter last year. Interest Income: Total interest income increased 733,000, or five percent, to 14.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 13.3 million for the same quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income from loans receivable, partly offset by a decrease in interest income from interest-earnings deposits. Interest income on loans receivable increased 847,000, or seven percent, to 13.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 12.2 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase was due to a higher average yield, partly offset by a lower average balance. The average yield on loans receivable increased 43 basis points to 4.97 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from an average yield of 4.54 percent in the same quarter last year. The higher weighted average loan yield was due primarily to the upward repricing of adjustable rate loans and new loan originations with higher weighted average interest rates. Adjustable-rate loans of approximately 122.2 million were repriced upward in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 by approximately 108 basis points from an average yield of 7.40 percent to 8.48 percent. The average balance of loans receivable decreased 23.5 million, or two percent, to 1.05 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 1.07 billion in the same quarter last year. Net deferred loan cost amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 85 percent to 355,000 from 192,000 in the same quarter last year. Total loans originated for investment in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were 28.9 million, up 56 percent from 18.5 million in the same quarter last year; while loan principal payments received in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were 34.0 million, up 48 percent from 23.0 million in the same quarter last year. Interest income from investment securities decreased 42,000, or eight percent, to 482,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 524,000 for the same quarter of fiscal 2024. This decrease was attributable to a lower average balance, partly offset by a higher average yield. The average balance of investment securities decreased 24.1 million, or 16 percent, to 129.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 153.7 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease in the average balance of investment securities was primarily the result of scheduled and accelerated principal payments on mortgage-backed securities. The average yield on investment securities increased 13 basis points to 1.49 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 1.36 percent for the same quarter last year. The increase in the average yield was primarily attributable to a lower premium amortization during the current quarter in comparison to the same quarter last year

 110,000 vs. 155,000) due to lower total principal repayments 5.7 million vs. 6.7 million) and the upward repricing of adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities. The Bank received 210,000 of cash dividends from FHLB San Francisco stock and other equity investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up 17 percent from 179,000 in the same quarter last year. The average balance of FHLB San Francisco stock and other equity investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 10.1 million, up six percent from 9.5 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2024 while the average yield was 8.30 percent, up 77 basis points from 7.53 percent. Interest income from interest-earning deposits, primarily cash deposited at the FRB of San Francisco, was 360,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, down 22 percent from 463,000 in the same quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was due a lower average balance, partly offset by a higher average yield. The average balance of interest-earning deposits decreased 7.7 million, or 23 percent, to 26.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 34.0 million in the same quarter last year primarily due to the Bank decreasing its liquidity position, which was mitigated by adequate borrowing capacities. The average yield earned on interest-earning deposits in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 5.35 percent, up three basis points from 5.32 percent in the same quarter last year, due primarily to an increase in the interest rate paid on excess reserves. Interest Expense: Total interest expense increased 1.3 million or 31 percent to 5.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 4.2 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was attributable to higher interest expense on borrowings and time deposits. Interest expense on deposits for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 2.8 million, a 50 percent increase from 1.9 million for the same quarter last year. The increase in interest expense on deposits was attributable to a higher average cost and, to a lesser extent, a higher average balance of time deposits. The average cost of deposits was 1.27 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up 47 basis points from 0.80 percent in the same quarter last year, primarily attributable to the average cost of time deposits (including brokered certificates of deposit) which increased 79 basis points to 3.95 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 3.16 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2024. The average balance of deposits decreased six percent to 880.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 940.2 million in the same quarter last year due to decreases in transaction accounts which was partly offset by an increase in time deposits. The average balance of transaction accounts was 613.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, down 14 percent from 715.2 million in the same quarter last year; while the average balance of time deposits (including brokered certificates of deposit) increased 19 percent to 267.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 225.0 million in the same quarter last year. Interest expense on borrowings, consisting of FHLB San Francisco advances, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 317,000, or 14 percent, to 2.6 million from 2.3 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily the result of a higher average cost of borrowings and, to a lesser extent, a higher average balance. The average cost of borrowings increased 41 basis points to 4.74 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 4.33 percent in the same quarter last year and the average balance of borrowings increased 8.2 million or four percent to 220.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 212.5 million in the same quarter last year.

Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses: During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Corporation recorded a recovery of credit losses of 697,000, in contrast to a 545,000 provision for credit losses recorded during the same period last year. The recovery of credit losses recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to a shorter estimated life of the loan portfolio resulting from decreased market interest rates and higher loan prepayment estimates. At September 30, 2024, the ACL on loans held for investment was 6.3 million, comprised of all collectively evaluated allowances, down 11 percent from 7.1 million at June 30, 2024 that were comprised of collectively evaluated allowances of 7.1 million and individually evaluated allowanced of 37,000. The ACL on loans as a percentage of gross loans held for investment was 0.61 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.67 percent at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the ACL on loans was due primarily to the recovery of credit losses in the first three months of fiscal 2025 697,000, which includes a 39,000 provision for unfunded loan commitment reserve).

 The following chart quantifies the factors contributing to the changes in the ACL on loans held for investment LHFI for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The changes in the ACL on LHFI for the quarter ended September 30, 2024: The changes in the ACL on LHFI for the quarter ended September 30, 2023: Management considers, based on currently available information, the ACL on loans sufficient to absorb expected losses in loans held for investment. See Asset Quality below and Note 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional discussion regarding the ACL on LHFI. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased 148,000, or 20 percent, to 899,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 751,000 in the same period last year, due primarily to a 125,000 increase in loan servicing and other fees (mainly attributable to a net fair value adjustment on unsaleable loans).

 Non-Interest Expense: For the Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Non-interest expenses increased 667,000, or 10 percent, to 7.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 6.9 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in the non-interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits increased 519,000, or 13 percent, to 4.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 from 4.1 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2024, representing the largest increase in non-interest expense. The increase was due primarily to higher employee compensation, incentive compensation and retirement plan expenses. Provision for Income Taxes: The income tax provision was 789,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up nine percent from 727,000 in the same quarter last year primarily due to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 29.3 percent as compared to 29.2 percent in the same quarter last year. The income tax provision reflects accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and California franchise tax based upon reported pre-tax income, adjusted for the effect of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes, such as non-deductible stock-based compensation and earnings from bank-owned life insurance policies, among others. Therefore, there are fluctuations in the effective income tax rate from period to period based on the relationship of net permanent differences to income before tax. Asset Quality Non-performing assets were comprised solely of 10 non-performing single-family loans at both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. Non-performing loans, net of the ACL, consisting of loans with collateral located in California, were 2.1 million at September 30, 2024, down 19 percent from 2.6 million at June 30, 2024. Non-performing loans as a percentage of LHFI at September 30, 2024 was 0.20 percent, compared to 0.25 percent at June 30, 2024. No interest accruals were made for non-performing loans. There were no loans that were past due 90 days or more and no real estate owned at either September 30, 2024 or June 30, 2024. For further analysis on non-performing loans, see the tables below and Note 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q.

Real estate values and real estate markets are beyond the Corporation s control and are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and other factors. These factors include fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans

 to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature, such as earthquakes, fires and national disasters particular to California where substantially all of the Corporation s real estate collateral is located. If real estate values decline, the value of the real estate collateral securing the Corporation s loans as set forth in the table could be significantly overstated. The Corporation s ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and it would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. The Corporation generally does not update the loan-to-value ratio on its LHFI by obtaining new appraisals or broker price opinions (nor does the Corporation intend to do so in the future as a result of the costs and inefficiencies associated with completing the task) unless a specific loan has demonstrated deterioration in which case individually evaluated allowances are established, if required. Loan Volume Activities The following table provides details related to the volume of loan originations, sales and principal payments for the quarters indicated: 

For the Quarter Ended September 30, (In Thousands) 2024 2023 Loans originated for sale: Wholesale originations 2,152 Total loans originated for sale 2,152 Loans sold: Servicing retained (2,152) Total loans sold (2,152) Loans originated for investment: Mortgage loans: Single-family 22,449 12,452 Multi-family 5,190 5,113 Commercial real estate 1,260 939 Commercial business loans 50 Total loans originated for investment 28,949 18,504 Loan principal payments (34,031) (22,988) Increase (decrease) in other items, net 736 (975) Net decrease in loans held for investment (4,346) (5,459) (1) Includes net changes in undisbursed loan funds, deferred loan fees or costs, ACL, fair value of loans held for investment and advance payments of escrows. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Corporation s primary sources of funds are deposits, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, proceeds from the maturity of loans and investment securities, FHLB San Francisco advances, access to the discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco and access to a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The primary investing activity of the Corporation is the origination and purchase of loans held for investment. During the first three months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Corporation originated loans held for investment of 28.9 million and 18.5

 million, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had loan origination commitments totaling 15.3 million, undisbursed lines of credit totaling 3.5 million and undisbursed construction loan funds totaling 311,000. The Corporation anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan funding commitments. During the first three months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, total loan repayments were 34.0 million and 23.0 million, respectively. The Corporation s primary financing activity is gathering deposits and, when needed, borrowings, principally FHLB San Francisco advances. During the first three months of fiscal 2025, total deposits decreased 24.4 million, or three percent, to 863.9 million, due to the declines in all account categories, except money market accounts. The time deposits include brokered certificates of deposit totaling 129.8 million and 131.8 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. At September 30, 2024, time deposits with a principal amount of 250,000 or less and scheduled to mature in one year or less were 188.1 million and total time deposits with a principal amount of more than 250,000 and scheduled to mature in one year or less were 37.2 million. Historically, the Corporation has been able to retain most of its time deposits as they mature. The Corporation must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to support loan growth and deposit withdrawals, to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities. The Corporation maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet short-term liquidity needs. At September 30, 2024, total cash and cash equivalents were 48.2 million, or four percent of total assets. Depending on market conditions and the pricing of deposit products, the Bank may rely on FHLB San Francisco advances for part of its liquidity needs. As of September 30, 2024, total borrowings were 249.5 million and the financing availability at the FHLB San Francisco was limited to 40 percent of total assets. As a result, the remaining borrowing capacity available was 249.2 million and the remaining available collateral was 346.9 million at September 30, 2024. In addition, the Bank has secured a 211.5 million discount window facility at the FRB of San Francisco, collateralized by investment securities and single-family fixed-rate loans with a total balance of 295.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank also has a borrowing arrangement in the form of a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for 50.0 million. The Bank had no advances under its discount window or correspondent bank facilities as of September 30, 2024. The Bank continues to work with both the FHLB - San Francisco and FRB of San Francisco to ensure that borrowing capacity is continuously reviewed and updated in order to be accessed seamlessly should the need arise. This includes establishing accounts and pledging assets as needed in order to maximize borrowing capacity and liquidity. The total remaining available borrowing capacity across all sources totaled approximately 510.7 million at September 30, 2024. Regulations require the Bank to maintain adequate liquidity to assure safe and sound operations. The Bank s average liquidity ratio (defined as the ratio of average qualifying liquid assets to average deposits and borrowings) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 16.6 percent, unchanged from the quarter ended June 30, 2024. On September 28, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan, authorizing up to 350,353 shares of the Corporation s outstanding common stock to be purchased over a one-year period. On September 26, 2024, the Board approved an extension of the stock repurchase plan for another year. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 95,475 shares or 27 percent of authorized shares for repurchase under the stock repurchase plan remained available to purchase. The Corporation purchases the shares from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions, the capital requirements of the Corporation, and available cash that can be allocated to the stock repurchase program, among other considerations. Provident Financial Holdings is a separate legal entity from the Bank and, on a stand-alone level, must provide for its own liquidity and pay its own operating expenses and cash dividends. Provident Financial Holdings primary sources of funds consist of capital raised through dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there are general regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. We expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock subject to our Board of Directors discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is 0.14 per share, as approved by our Board of Directors, which we believe is a dividend rate per share which enables us to balance our multiple objectives of managing and investing in the Bank, and returning a portion of our cash to our shareholders. Assuming continued cash dividend payments during fiscal 2025 at 0.14 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately 948,000 based on the number of outstanding shares at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of 9.8 million.

 The Bank, as a federally-chartered, federally insured savings bank, is subject to the capital requirements established by the OCC. Under the OCC s capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. At September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The Bank was categorized as "well-capitalized" at September 30, 2024 under the regulations of the OCC. As a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve, Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. is also subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve. For a bank holding company with less than 3.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis, and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company s subsidiary bank to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. The Bank s actual and required minimum capital amounts and ratios at the dates indicated are as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Regulatory Requirements Minimum for Capital Minimum to Be Actual Adequacy Purposes Well Capitalized Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (1) Amount Ratio Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B.: As of September 30, 2024 Tier 1 leverage capital (to adjusted average assets) 119,881 9.63 49,803 4.00 62,253 5.00 CET1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 119,881 18.36 45,701 7.00 42,437 6.50 Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 119,881 18.36 55,494 8.50 52,230 8.00 Total capital (to risk-weighted assets) 126,306 19.35 68,552 10.50 65,288 10.00 As of June 30, 2024 (2) Tier 1 leverage capital (to adjusted average assets) 126,601 10.02 50,555 4.00 63,194 5.00 CET1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 126,601 19.29 45,934 7.00 42,653 6.50 Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) 126,601 19.29 55,777 8.50 52,496 8.00 Total capital (to risk-weighted assets) 133,723 20.38 68,900 10.50 65,620 10.00 (1) Inclusive of the conservation buffer of 2.50 for Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios. (2) The Bank elected to recognize the full 824 thousand adjustment to retained earnings resulting from the adoption of CECL on July 1, 2023 instead of over the permitted three-year phase-in option. In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5 of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. If the Bank does not have the ability to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may be limited in its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders. The Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend if the effect thereafter would cause its net worth to be reduced below the regulatory capital requirements imposed by federal regulation. On September 26, 2024, the Bank paid 9.0 million cash dividend to the Holding Company.

One of the Corporation s principal financial objectives is to achieve long-term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating interest rates. The Corporation has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by attempting to manage the repricing mismatch between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest-rate sensitivity of the Corporation s interest-earning assets by retaining for its portfolio new loan originations with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions. In addition, the Corporation maintains an investment portfolio, which is largely comprised of U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS with contractual maturities of up to 30 years that reprice frequently or have a relatively short average life. The Corporation relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds while utilizing FHLB San Francisco advances and, from time to time, brokered certificates of deposit as a secondary source of funding. Management believes retail deposits, unlike brokered certificates of deposit, reduces the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds. As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, the Corporation promotes transaction accounts and time deposits with terms up to seven years. Using an internal interest rate risk model, the Corporation is able to analyze its interest rate risk exposure by measuring the change in net portfolio value NPV over a variety of interest rate scenarios. NPV is defined as the net present value of expected future cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments, if any. The calculation is intended to illustrate the change in NPV that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates of -300, -200, -100, +100, +200 and +300 basis points bp with no consideration given to steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movement. As of September 30, 2024, the targeted federal funds rate range was 4.75 to 5.00 . The following table is derived from the internal interest rate risk model and represents the NPV based on the indicated changes in interest rates as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands).

 The following table is derived from the interest rate risk model and represents the change in the NPV at a -200 basis point rate shock at September 30, 2024 and a +200 basis point rate shock at June 30, 2024, each of which scenarios were the most severe shock of plus or minus 200 basis point rate shocks. 

At September 30, 2024 At June 30, 2024 (-200 bp rate shock) (+200 bp rate shock) Pre-Shock NPV Ratio: NPV as a of PV Assets 11.40 10.12 Post-Shock NPV Ratio: NPV as a of PV Assets 10.17 9.17 Sensitivity Measure: Change in NPV Ratio -123 bp -95 bp The pre-shock NPV ratio increased 128 basis points to 11.40 percent at September 30, 2024 from 10.12 percent at June 30, 2024 and the post-shock NPV ratio increased 100 basis points to 10.17 percent at September 30, 2024 from 9.17 percent at June 30, 2024. The increase of the pre-shock NPV ratio was primarily attributable to the changes in market interest rates, the composition of the balance sheet and the net income in the first three months of fiscal 2025, partly offset by a 9.0 million cash dividend distribution from the Bank to Provident Financial Holdings in September 2024. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage ARM loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the loan. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could likely deviate significantly from those assumptions used when calculating the results described in the tables above. It is also possible that, as a result of an interest rate increase, the higher mortgage payments required from ARM loans could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults. Accordingly, the data presented in the tables in this section should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates. Furthermore, the NPV presented in the foregoing tables is not intended to present the fair market value of the Corporation, nor does it represent amounts that would be available for distribution to shareholders in the event of the liquidation of the Corporation. The Corporation measures and evaluates the potential effects of interest rate movements through an interest rate sensitivity "gap" analysis. Interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income when there is movement in interest rates. For loans held for investment, investment securities, deposits and borrowings with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual repricing or scheduled maturity. For transaction accounts (checking, money market and savings deposits) that have no contractual maturity, the table presents estimated principal cash flows and, as applicable, the Corporation s historical experience, management s judgment and statistical analysis concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors.

 The following table represents the interest rate gap analysis of the Corporation s assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024:

 The static gap analysis under 12 months or less duration, Greater than 1 year to 3 years duration and Greater than 3 years to 5 years duration show negative positions in the "Cumulative repricing gap - dollar amount" category, indicating more liabilities are sensitive to repricing than assets in the short and intermediate terms. Management views noninterest-bearing deposits to be the least sensitive to changes in market interest rates and these accounts are therefore characterized as long-term funding. Interest-bearing checking deposits are considered more sensitive, followed by increased sensitivity for savings and money market deposits. For the purpose of calculating gap, a portion of these interest-bearing deposit balances are assumed to be subject to estimated repricing as follows: interest-bearing checking deposits at 15 per year, savings deposits at 20 per year and money market deposits at 50 in the first and second years. The gap results presented above could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in the preparation of the gap analysis. Furthermore, the gap analysis provides a static view of

 interest rate risk exposure at a specific point in time without taking into account redirection of cash flow activity and deposit fluctuations. The extent to which the net interest margin will be impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates will depend on a number of factors, including how quickly interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities react to interest rate changes. It is not uncommon for rates on certain assets or liabilities to lag changes in the market interest rates. Additionally, prepayments of loans and early withdrawals of time deposits could cause interest sensitivities to vary. As a result, the relationship between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as shown in the previous table, is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity and the effect of changing interest rates on net interest income is likely to be different from that predicted solely on the basis of the interest rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the previous table. The Corporation also models the sensitivity of net interest income for the 12-month period subsequent to any given month-end assuming a dynamic balance sheet accounting for, among other items: The Corporation s current balance sheet and repricing characteristics; Forecasted balance sheet growth consistent with the business plan; Current interest rates and yield curves and management estimates of projected interest rates; Embedded options, interest rate floors, periodic caps and lifetime caps; Repricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments; Loan, investment security, deposit and borrowing cash flows; Loan prepayment estimates for each type of loan; and Immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of +300, +200 and +100, and -100, -200 and -300 basis points . 
 The following table describes the results of the sensitivity of the net interest income analysis at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 

At September 30, 2024 At June 30, 2024 Basis Point (bp) Change in Basis Point (bp) Change in Change in Rates Net Interest Income Change in Rates Net Interest Income +300 bp -1.29 +300 bp -8.12 +200 bp 0.26 +200 bp -3.45 +100 bp 0.32 +100 bp -0.51 -100 bp -0.43 -100 bp -0.67 -200 bp -1.91 -200 bp -1.15 -300 bp -4.80 -300 bp -1.86 At September 30, 2024, the Corporation was in a slightly asset sensitive position as its interest-earning assets were expected to reprice more quickly than its interest-bearing liabilities during the subsequent 12-month period. Therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, the model projects an increase in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period, except under the +300 basis point scenario. In a falling interest rate environment, the results project a decrease in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period. At June 30, 2024, the Corporation was close to neutral with regard to the sensitivity of net interest income as projected net interest income declines slightly under rising or declining interest rates during the subsequent 12-month period. Management believes that the assumptions used to complete the analysis described in the table above are reasonable. However, past experience has shown that immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates will not necessarily occur. Additionally, while the analysis provides a tool to evaluate the projected net interest income to changes in interest rates, actual results may be substantially different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to complete the analysis, particularly with respect to the 12-month business plan when asset growth is forecast. Therefore, the model results that the Corporation discloses should be thought of as a risk management tool to compare the trends of the Corporation s current disclosure to previous disclosures, over time, within the context of the actual performance of the treasury yield curve.

 ITEM 4 Controls and Procedures. (a) An evaluation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Section 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act )) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer) and the Corporation s Disclosure Committee as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In designing and evaluating the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Also, because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on their evaluation, the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports it files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Corporation s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. (b) There have been no changes in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting. The Corporation does not expect that its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. Periodically, there have been various claims and lawsuits involving the Corporation, such as claims to enforce liens, condemnation proceedings on properties in which the Corporation holds security interests, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans, employment matters and other issues in the ordinary course of and incidental to the Corporation s business. These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable. Additionally, in some actions, it is difficult to assess potential exposure because the Corporation is still in the early stages of the litigation. The Corporation is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that it believes would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operations or cash flows.
