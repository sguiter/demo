NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 
 properties a s of September 30, 2024 are located in states and Washington, D.C., and our tenants operate under a variety of national and regional retail brands. We are internally managed by our management team, which has extensive experience acquiring, owning and managing convenience, automotive and other single tenant retail real estate, and we are headquartered in New York, New York.

indicators of impairment related to any of our direct financing leases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , and, accordingly, we did t record any additional allowance for credit losses in either period. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, of our direct financing leases was modified. Upon modification, we reassessed the lease classification and determined that the lease meets the definition of an operating lease under ASC 842. Accordingly, we reclassified the amounts recorded as investment in direct financing leases immediately prior to the modification of million to building and improvements on our consolidated balance sheets. When we enter into a contract to sell properties that are recorded as direct financing leases, we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that the disposition will occur. If we determine that the disposition is probable and therefore the property s holding period is reduced, we may adjust an allowance for credit losses to reflect the change in the estimate of the undiscounted future rents. Accordingly, the net investment balance is written down to fair value.

million and, as of September 30, 2024, had outstanding million of such construction loans and development financing. Our construction loans and development financing generally provide for funding only during the construction period, which is typically nine to twelve months, although our policy is to consider construction periods as long as 24 months. Funds are disbursed based on inspections in accordance with a schedule reflecting the completion of portions of the projects. We also review and inspect each property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. At the end of the construction period, the construction loans will be repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the properties. The construction for properties was completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and at the end of the construction period, we recognized the purchase of the assets, removed the finance receivables of million, and began to record rental income from the operating leases. In addition, we may acquire real estate assets under construction from the tenant and commit to provide additional funding to our tenants during the construction period to complete the properties. These transactions do not meet the criteria for sale-leaseback accounting and are accounted for as finance receivables. Accordingly, initial investments and all subsequent fundings made during the construction period are recorded within notes and mortgages receivable on our consolidated balance sheets, and rental payments resulting from these investments are recorded within interest on notes and mortgages receivable on our consolidated statements of operations. At the end of the construction period, we will recognize the purchase of the assets, remove the finance receivables from our consolidated balance sheets, and begin to record rental income from the operating leases. The construction for properties was completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and at the end of the construction period, we recognized the purchase of the assets, removed the finance receivables of million, and began to record rental income from the operating leases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we funded additional million of such investments and, as of September 30, 2024, had a total of million of such investments outstanding and recorded in notes and mortgages receivable. 
 
 million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our estimated fair values, as they relate to property carrying values, were primarily based upon (i) estimated sales prices from third-party offers based on signed contracts, letters of intent or indicative bids, which resulted in million of impairment charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and impairment charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and (ii) discounted cash flow models, which resulted in impairment charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and impairment charges of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded the remaining impairments of million and million, respectively, due to the accumulation of asset retirement costs as a result of changes in estimates associated with our estimated environmental liabilities which increased the carrying values of certain properties in excess of their fair values. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, impairment charges aggregating million and million, respectively, were related to properties that were previously disposed of by us.

properties and leased properties from third-party landlords. These properties are located in states across the United States and Washington, D.C. Substantially all of our properties are leased on a triple-net basis to convenience store operators, petroleum distributors, express tunnel car wash operators and other automotive-related and retail tenants. Our tenants either operate their business at our properties directly or, in the case of certain convenience stores and gasoline and repair stations, sublet our properties and supply fuel to third parties that operate the business. Our triple-net lease tenants are responsible for the payment of all taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance and other operating expenses relating to our properties, and are also responsible for environmental contamination occurring during the terms of their leases. Substantially all of our tenants are also responsible for pre-existing environmental contamination that is discovered during their lease term, except contamination that was known at lease commencement, as to which we have established reserves. For additional information regarding our environmental obligations, see Note 7 Environmental Obligations. The majority of our tenants financial results depend on convenience store sales, the sale of refined petroleum products and/or the sale of automotive services and parts. As a result, our tenants financial results can be dependent on the performance of the consumer retail, petroleum marketing, automobile manufacturing, and automobile aftermarket industries, each of which are highly competitive and can be subject to variability. During the terms of our leases, we monitor the credit quality of our triple-net lease tenants by reviewing their published credit rating, if available, reviewing publicly available financial statements, or reviewing financial or other operating statements which are delivered to us pursuant to applicable lease agreements, monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and monitoring the timeliness of lease payments and the performance of other financial covenants under their leases. Pursuant to ASU 2016-02, for leases in which we are the lessor, we are (i) retaining classification of our historical leases as we were not required to reassess classification upon adoption of the new standard, (ii) expensing indirect leasing costs in connection with new or extended tenant leases, the recognition of which would have been deferred under prior accounting guidance, and (iii) aggregating revenue from our lease components and non-lease components (comprised of tenant reimbursements) into revenue from rental properties. Revenues from Rental Properties Revenues from rental properties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , were million and million, respectively, including base rental income of million and million, respectively. Revenues from rental properties were million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, including base rental income of million and million, respectively. In accordance with GAAP, we recognize rental revenue in amounts which vary from the amount of rent contractually due during the periods presented. As a result, revenues from rental properties include non-cash adjustments recorded for (i) deferred rental revenue due to the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the current lease term, (ii) the net amortization of intangible market lease assets and liabilities, (iii) rental income recorded under direct financing leases using the effective interest method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties, and (iv) the amortization of deferred lease incentives. Non-cash adjustments included in revenues from rental properties was an increase in revenue of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively . Non-cash adjustments included in revenues from rental properties was 

 8 

million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a reduction in revenue of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Tenant reimbursements, which consist of real estate taxes and other municipal charges paid by us and reimbursed by our tenants pursuant to the terms of triple-net lease agreements, were million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

In accordance with ASU 2016-13, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had recorded an allowance for credit losses of million and million, respectively, on investment in direct financing leases. We evaluate the credit quality of our investment in direct financing leases utilizing internal underwriting and credit analysis. Substantially all of our tenants under direct financing leases are required to provide us with specified unit-level and/or corporate-level financial information. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no material balances of our investment in direct financing leases were past due. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, one of our direct financing leases was modified. Upon modification, we reassessed the lease classification and determined the lease meets the definition of an operating lease under ASC 842. Accordingly, we reclassified the amounts recorded as investment in direct financing leases immediately prior to the modification to building and improvements. Minimum Rents Due

As Lessee For leases in which we are the lessee, lease accounting standards require leases with durations greater than twelve months to be recognized on our consolidated balance sheets. We elected the package of transition provisions available for expired or existing contracts, which allowed us to carry forward our historical assessments of (i) whether contracts are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. As of January 1, 2019, we recognized operating lease right-of-use assets of million (net of deferred rent expense) and operating lease liabilities of million, which were presented on our consolidated financial statements. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are carried at the present value of the remaining expected future lease payments. When available, we use the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value; however, our current leases did not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, we estimated our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available and considered factors such as interest rates available to us on a fully collateralized basis and terms of the leases. ASU 2016-02 did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets or on our consolidated statements of operations. The most significant impact was the

Global Partners LP (NYSE: GLP) 

APRO, LLC (d/b/a United Oil) 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we amended of our unitary leases with Global Partners LP ("Global"). Pursuant to the amendment, the term of the lease was extended by to , contractual base rent due under the lease was increased by million to million, and the number of properties subject to the lease was decreased by properties. The properties removed from the lease were sold to Global for million. All other material terms of the lease remained substantially unchanged. Getty Petroleum Marketing Inc. Getty Petroleum Marketing Inc. Marketing was our largest tenant from 1997 until 2012 under a unitary triple-net master lease that was terminated in April 2012 as a consequence of Marketing s bankruptcy, at which time we either sold or re-leased these properties. As of September 30, 2024 , of the properties we own or lease were previously leased to Marketing, of which properties are subject to long-term triple-net leases across separate portfolios, properties are leased as single unit triple-net leases and property is vacant. The leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing are unitary triple-net lease agreements generally with an initial term of years and options for successive renewal terms of up to years. As of September 30, 2024 , our weighted average remaining lease term, excluding renewal options, for the properties previously leased to Marketing was years. Rent is scheduled to increase at varying intervals during both the initial and renewal terms of the leases. Certain of the leases provide for additional rent based on the aggregate volume of fuel sold. In addition, the majority of the leases require the tenants to invest capital in our properties, substantially all of which are related to the replacement of USTs that are owned by our tenants. As of September 30, 2024 , we had a remaining commitment to fund up to million in the aggregate with our tenants for our portion of such capital improvements. Our commitment provides us with the option to either reimburse our tenants or to offset rent when these capital expenditures are made. This deferred expense is recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rental revenue on our consolidated statements of operations over the life of the various leases. As part of the triple-net leases for properties previously leased to Marketing, we transferred title of the USTs to our tenants, and the obligation to pay for the retirement and decommissioning or removal of USTs at the end of their useful lives, or earlier if circumstances warranted, was fully or partially transferred to our new tenants. Accordingly, through September 30, 2024 , we have removed million of asset retirement obligations and million of net asset retirement costs related to USTs from our balance sheet. The cumulative change of million (net of accumulated amortization of million) is recorded as deferred rental revenue and will be recognized on a straight-line basis as additional revenues from rental properties over the terms of the various leases. We remain contingently liable for this obligation in the event that our tenants do not satisfy their responsibilities.

amounts accrued for certain of these matters which we believe were appropriate based on information then currently available. We are unable to estimate ranges in excess of the amount accrued with any certainty for these matters. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental litigation accruals. Matters related to our former Newark, New Jersey Terminal and the Lower Passaic River, and our methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as MTBE litigations in the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland, in particular, could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Matters related to our former Newark, New Jersey Terminal and the Lower Passaic River In 2004, the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA issued General Notice Letters GNL to over entities, including us, alleging that they are potentially responsible parties PRPs with respect to a 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River from Dundee Dam to the Newark Bay and its tributaries (the Lower Passaic River Study Area or LPRSA ). The LPRSA is part of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site Superfund Site that includes the former Diamond Shamrock Corporation manufacturing facility located at 80-120 Lister Ave. in Newark, New Jersey (the Diamond Shamrock Facility ), the LPRSA, and the Newark Bay Study Area (i.e., Newark Bay and portions of surrounding rivers and channels). One of the GNL recipients is Occidental Chemical Corporation Occidental ), the predecessor to the former owner/operator of the Diamond Shamrock Facility responsible for the discharge of 2,3,8,8-TCDD dioxin and other hazardous substances. In May 2007, over GNL recipients, including us, entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent AOC with the EPA to perform a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study RI/FS for the LPRSA to address investigation and evaluation of alternative remedial actions with respect to alleged damages to the entire 17-mile LPRSA, which the EPA has designated Operable Unit 4 or OU4 . Many of the parties to the AOC, including us, are also members of a Cooperating Parties Group CPG ). In 2015, the CPG submitted a draft RI/FS to the EPA setting forth various alternatives for remediating the LPRSA. In October 2018, the EPA issued a letter directing the CPG to prepare a streamlined feasibility study for just the upper 9-miles of the LPRSA based on an iterative approach using adaptive management strategies. On December 4, 2020, the CPG submitted a Final Draft Interim Remedy Feasibility Study IR/FS to the EPA which identified various targeted dredge and cap alternatives for the upper 9-miles of the LPRSA. On September 28, 2021, the EPA issued a Record of Decision ROD for the upper 9-mile IR/FS Upper 9-mile IR ROD consisting of dredging and capping to control sediment sources of dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyls at an estimated cost of million. In addition to the RI/FS activities, in June 2012, certain members of the CPG entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent 10.9 AOC with the EPA to perform certain remediation activities, including removal and capping of sediments at the river mile 10.9 area and certain testing, which remedial work has been completed. Concurrent with the CPG s work on the RI/FS, on April 11, 2014, the EPA issued a draft Focused Feasibility Study FFS with proposed remedial alternatives to remediate the lower 8.3-miles of the LPRSA. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a ROD for the lower 8.3-miles Lower 8-mile ROD selecting a remedy that involves bank-to-bank dredging and installing an engineered cap with an estimated cost of billion. On March 31, 2016, the EPA issued a Notice of Potential Liability and Commencement of Negotiations for Remedial Design Notice to more than PRPs, including us, which informed the recipients that the EPA intends to seek an Administrative Order on Consent and Settlement Agreement with Occidental (who the EPA considers the primary contributor of dioxin and other pesticides generated from the production of Agent Orange at its Diamond Shamrock Facility and a discharger of other contaminants of concern COCs to the Superfund Site) requiring Occidental to prepare the remedial design of the remedy selected in the Lower 8-mile ROD. The EPA has designated the lower 8.3 miles of the LPRSA as Operable Unit 2 or OU2 , which is geographically subsumed within OU4. On September 30, 2016, Occidental entered into an agreement with the EPA to perform the remedial design for OU2. By letter dated March 30, 2017, the EPA advised the recipients of the Notice that it would be entering into cash out settlements with certain PRPs who the EPA stated did not discharge any of the eight hazardous substances identified as a COC in the Lower 8-mile ROD to resolve their alleged liability for OU2. Cash out settlements were finalized in 2018 and 2021 with a total of PRPs. The EPA s March 30, 2017 letter also stated that other parties who did not discharge dioxins, furans or polychlorinated biphenyls (which are considered the COCs posing the greatest risk to the river) may also be eligible for cash out settlements, and that the EPA would begin a process for identifying such other PRPs for negotiation of future cash out settlements and to initiate negotiations with Occidental and

defendants, including us, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey seeking cost recovery and contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act for response costs incurred and to be incurred relating to the LPRSA, including the investigation, design, and anticipated implementation of the OU2 remedy (the Occidental Lawsuit ). We continue to defend the claims asserted in the Occidental Lawsuit individually and in coordination with a group of several other named defendants known as the Small Parties Group or SPG consistent with our defenses in the related proceedings. On January 5, 2024, the Court entered an Order to Stay the Occidental Lawsuit pending the Court s adjudication of a Motion to Enter the Modified Consent Decree filed by the United States on January 31, 2024, as discussed below. The allocator issued a final Allocation Recommendation Report in December 2020, which was based upon an . As a result of the allocation process, the EPA and parties (the Settling Parties ), including us, began settlement negotiations and reached an agreement on a cash-out settlement to resolve their alleged liability for the remediation of the entire LPRSA. The EPA concluded that the Settling Parties, individually and collectively, were responsible for only a minor share of the response costs incurred and to be incurred at or in connection with implementing the OU2 and OU4 remedies for the entire 17-mile Lower Passaic River. In December 2022, the EPA and the Settling Parties finalized their agreement in a proposed consent decree CD ), pursuant to which and without admitting liability, the Settling Parties agree to pay the EPA the collective sum of million in exchange for contribution protection from claims by non-settling PRPs (including Occidental) for the matters addressed in the CD and the issuance of a notice of completion by the EPA of both the 2007 RI/FS AOC and the 10.9 AOC, upon completion of certain defined tasks in the CD. All Settling Parties contributed to an escrow account agreed upon shares of the settlement amount, which are subject to a confidentiality agreement. Our settlement contribution is in line with our legal reserves previously established. On December 16, 2022, the United States filed an action in the New Jersey District Court against the Settling Defendants which included lodging of the proposed CD to resolve claims against the Settling Parties for costs associated with cleaning up the LPRSA. This action (the CD Action is subject to public comment and court approval. On December 22, 2022, the EPA published a notice of lodging of the proposed CD in the Federal Register, opening a 45-day public comment period, which was subsequently extended to 90-days. On December 23, 2022, Occidental filed a motion to intervene in the CD Action, and subsequently filed voluminous comments objecting to the entry of the proposed CD. On January 17, 2024, the United States informed the Court that it completed reviewing public comments, including those from Occidental, and found no reasons to consider the proposed CD as inappropriate, improper, or inadequate. Nevertheless, the United States decided that certain limited changes to the CD should be made prior to moving for approval thereof. These changes involved removing three parties and a modification to the United States reservation of rights. The remaining Settling Parties, including us, concurred with these changes, leading to the United States filing the Modified Consent Decree Modified CD ), with the Court on the same day, January 17, 2024. On January 31, 2024, the United States filed a copy of all public comments received on the proposed CD, its Response to the public comments and a Motion to Enter the Modified CD. The Motion to Enter the Modified CD and accompanying memorandum of law states that the United States has determined that the proposed settlement is reasonable, fair and consistent with the statutory purpose of CERCLA. The Court issued an order requiring that responses to the Motion to Enter the Modified CD be filed by April 1, 2024, and any replies to these responses be filed by May 1, 2024, prior to adjudication of the Motion. Following the Court s briefing schedule, the parties to the Modified CD filed briefs in support of the Motion, while intervenor parties, including Occidental, filed response briefs opposing the Motion, raising multiple legal challenges. other potentially responsible parties also filed intervenor response briefs seeking inclusion in the settlement. As of July 9, 2024, the Court has allowed additional briefing on the applicability of recent Supreme Court rulings to the issues under consideration. The Court has not provided a timeline for ruling on the pending Motion nor has it indicated whether further briefing and/or a hearing will be scheduled. If the Modified CD is approved in its current form, our alleged liability to the EPA and to any non-settling parties, including Occidental, for the remediation of the entire 17-mile Lower Passaic River and its tributaries will be resolved. If the District Court does not approve the Modified CD, then, based on currently known facts and circumstances, including, among other factors, the EPA s conclusion that we are individually and collectively with numerous other parties only responsible for a minor share of the response costs incurred or to be incurred in connection with the LPRSA, our relative participation in the costs related to the 2007 AOC and 10.9 AOC, our belief that there was not any use or discharge of dioxins, furans or polychlorinated biphenyls in connection with our former petroleum storage operations at our former Newark, New Jersey Terminal, and that there are numerous other parties who will likely bear the costs of remediation and/or damages, we do not believe that resolution of the Lower Passaic River proceedings as relates to us is reasonably likely to have a material impact on our results of operations. Nevertheless, if the Modified CD is not approved by the District Court in its current form, performance of the EPA s selected remedies for the LPRSA may be subject to future negotiation, potential enforcement proceedings and/or possible litigation and, on this basis, our ultimate liability in the pending and possible future proceedings pertaining to the LPRSA remains uncertain and subject to contingencies which cannot be predicted and the outcome of which are not yet known. In prior years, we have established an estimated legal reserve and subsequently transferred funds to an escrow account based on

other petroleum refiners, manufacturers, transporters, distributors and retailers of MTBE or gasoline containing MTBE who are alleged to have manufactured, distributed, stored and sold MTBE gasoline in Pennsylvania. The complaint seeks compensation for natural resource damages and for injuries sustained as a result of defendants unfair and deceptive trade practices and act in the marketing of MTBE and gasoline containing MTBE. The plaintiffs also seek to recover costs paid or incurred by the State to detect, treat and remediate MTBE from public and private water wells and groundwater. The plaintiffs assert causes of action against all defendants based on multiple theories, including strict liability defective design; strict liability failure to warn; public nuisance; negligence; trespass; and violation of consumer protection law. The case was filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, but was removed by defendants to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and then transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York so that it may be managed as part of the ongoing MTBE MDL proceedings. In November 2015, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint naming additional defendants and adding factual allegations against the defendants. We joined with other defendants in the filing of a motion to dismiss the claims against us, which was granted in part and denied in part. The discovery phase of the litigation is now closed, and active pretrial motion practice is ongoing. The State has filed a motion to remand the case to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for trial, though a trial date is yet to be scheduled. Multiple defendants in the case have settled with plaintiff. We continue to vigorously defend the claims made against us. Our ultimate liability in this proceeding is uncertain and subject to numerous contingencies, the outcome of which are not yet known. MTBE Litigation State of Maryland On December 17, 2017, the State of Maryland, by and through the Attorney General on behalf of the Maryland Department of Environment and the Maryland Department of Health (the State of Maryland ), filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City related to alleged statewide MTBE contamination in Maryland. The complaint was served upon us on January 19, 2018. The complaint names us and more than other defendants. The complaint seeks compensation for natural resource damages and for injuries sustained as a result of the defendants unfair and deceptive trade practices in the marketing of MTBE and gasoline containing MTBE. The plaintiffs also seek to recover costs paid or incurred by the State of Maryland to detect, investigate, treat and remediate MTBE from public and private water wells and groundwater, punitive damages and the award of attorneys fees and litigation costs. The plaintiffs assert causes of action against all defendants based on multiple theories, including strict liability defective design; strict liability failure to warn; strict liability for abnormally dangerous activity; public nuisance; negligence; trespass; and violations of Titles 4, 7 and 9 of the Maryland Environmental Code. On February 14, 2018, defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. We are vigorously defending the claims made against us. Our ultimate liability, if any, in this proceeding is uncertain and subject to numerous contingencies the outcome of which are not yet known.

(a) Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility were and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and are included in prepaid expenses and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. 

Revolving Credit Facility In October 2021, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (as amended, the Second Restated Credit Agreement ). The Second Restated Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of million and includes an accordion feature to increase the revolving commitments or add one or more tranches of term loans up to an additional aggregate amount not to exceed million, subject to certain conditions, including one or more new or existing lenders agreeing to provide commitments for such increased amount and that no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures , subject to exercisable at our option. Our exercise of an extension option is subject to the absence of any default and our compliance with certain conditions, including the payment of extension fees to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the sum of a SOFR rate plus a SOFR adjustment of plus a margin of to , or (ii) the sum of a base rate plus a margin of to , in each case with the margin based on our consolidated total indebtedness to total asset value ratio at the end of each quarterly reporting period. The per annum rate of the unused line fee on the undrawn funds under the Revolving Credit Facility is to based on our daily unused portion of the available Revolving Credit Facility. Term Loan In October 2023, we entered into a term loan credit agreement (the "Term Loan Agreement") that provides for a senior unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") in an aggregate principal amount of million. The Term Loan matures , subject to extension exercisable at our option. Our exercise of the extension option is subject to the absence of any default and our compliance with certain conditions, including the payment of extension fees to the lenders under the Term Loan. The Term Loan is comprised of (i) an initial principal amount of million that was funded in a single draw at closing and used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, and (ii) an additional principal amount of million that was funded in a single draw in April 2024. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the sum of a SOFR rate plus a SOFR adjustment of plus a margin of to , or (ii) the sum of a base rate plus a margin of to , in each case with the margin based on our consolidated total indebtedness to total asset value ratio at the end of each quarterly reporting period. In connection with the Term Loan, we entered into interest rate swaps for a notional amount of million to fix SOFR at weighted average of until maturity. Including the impact of the swaps, the effective interest rate on the Term Loan is based on our consolidated total indebtedness. Senior Unsecured Notes In February 2022, we entered into a sixth amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Prudential (the "Sixth Amended and Restated Prudential Agreement") pursuant to which, in January 2023, we issued million of Series Q Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series Q Notes to Prudential and used the proceeds to repay the million of Series B Guaranteed Senior Notes

(the Series B Notes outstanding under its fifth amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with Prudential (the "Fifth Amended and Restated Prudential Agreement"). The other senior unsecured notes outstanding under the Fifth Amended and Restated Prudential Agreement, including (i) million of Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes due , (ii) million of Series D Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series D Notes ), (iii) million of Series F Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series F Notes ), and (iv) million of Series I Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series I Notes ), remain outstanding under the Sixth Amended and Restated Prudential Agreement. In February 2022, we entered into a second amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with American General Life Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, AIG (the Second Amended and Restated AIG Agreement pursuant to which we issued million of Series L Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series L Notes to AIG. The other senior unsecured notes outstanding under our first amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with AIG (the First Amended and Restated AIG Agreement ), including (i) million of Series G Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series G Notes ), and (ii) million of Series J Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series J Notes ), remain outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated AIG Agreement. In February 2022, we entered into a second amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, MassMutual (the Second Amended and Restated MassMutual Agreement pursuant to which we issued million of Series M Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series M Notes and, in January 2023, million of Series O Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series O Notes to MassMutual. The other senior unsecured notes outstanding under our first amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with MassMutual (the First Amended and Restated MassMutual Agreement ), including (i) million of Series H Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series H Notes ), and (ii) million of Series K Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series K Notes ), remain outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated MassMutual Agreement. In February 2022, we entered into a note purchase and guarantee agreement with New York Life Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, New York Life (the New York Life Agreement pursuant to which we issued million of Series N Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series N Notes and, in January 2023, million of Series P Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series P Notes to New York Life. On June 21, 2018, we entered into a note purchase and guarantee agreement with MetLife and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "MetLife") (the MetLife Agreement pursuant to which we issued million of Series E Guaranteed Senior Notes due (the Series E Notes to MetLife. The funded and outstanding Series C Notes, Series D Notes, Series E Notes, Series F Note, Series G Notes, Series H Notes, Series I Notes, Series J Notes, Series K Notes, Series L Notes, Series M Notes, Series N Notes, Series O Notes, Series P Notes, and Series Q Notes are collectively referred to as the "Senior Unsecured Notes". Covenants The Second Restated Credit Agreement, Term Loan Agreement and Senior Unsecured Notes contain customary financial covenants such as leverage, coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. The Second Restated Credit Agreement, Term Loan Agreement and Senior Unsecured Notes also contain customary events of default, including cross defaults to each other, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status (provided that the Senior Unsecured Notes require a mandatory offer to prepay the notes upon a change in control in lieu of a change of control event of default). Any event of default, if not cured or waived in a timely manner, would increase by 200 basis points the interest rate we pay under the Second Restated Credit Agreement, Term Loan Agreement and Senior Unsecured Notes, and could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan and Senior Unsecured Notes. We may be prohibited from drawing funds under the Revolving Credit Facility if there is any event or condition that constitutes an event of default under the Second Restated Credit Agreement or that, with the giving of any notice, the passage of time, or both, would be an event of default under the Second Restated Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all of the material terms of the Second Restated Credit Agreement, Term Loan Agreement and Senior Unsecured Notes, including the various financial covenants described herein.

Also, in October 2023, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge against changes in interest rates from the trade date through the projected issuance date of million of additional variable-rate borrowings, and to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on the additional million of variable-rate borrowings over a maximum period ending October 2026. During the next twelve months, we estimate that million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income as an increase to interest expense.

years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases) (a Lookback Period . Similarly, for certain properties previously leased to Marketing which we have sold, we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that was known at the time of the sale and for unknown environmental contamination which existed prior to the sale and which is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) within years of the closing (also, a Lookback Period ). After expiration of the applicable Lookback Period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination at these properties, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease or sale, is the contractual responsibility of our tenant or buyer as the case may be. Based on the expiration of the Lookback Periods, together with other factors which have significantly mitigated our potential liability for preexisting environmental obligations, including the absence of any contractual obligations relating to properties which have been sold, quantifiable trends associated with types and ages of USTs at issue, expectations regarding future UST replacements, and historical trends and expectations regarding discovery of preexisting unknown environmental contamination and/or attempted pursuit of the Company therefore, we concluded that there is no material continued risk of having to satisfy contractual obligations relating to preexisting unknown environmental contamination at certain properties. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024 , we had removed million of unknown reserve liabilities which had previously been accrued for these properties. We continue to anticipate that our tenants under leases where the Lookback Periods have expired will replace USTs in the years ahead as these USTs near the end of their expected useful lives. At many of these properties the USTs in use were fabricated with older 

 18 

million of unknown reserve liabilities for certain properties with respect to which the Lookback Periods have expired as of September 30, 2024. In the course of UST removals and replacements at certain properties previously leased to Marketing where we retained responsibility for preexisting unknown environmental contamination until expiration of the applicable Lookback Period, environmental contamination has been and continues to be discovered. As a result, we developed an estimate of fair value for the prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination and accrued for these estimated costs. These estimates are based primarily upon quantifiable trends which we believe allow us to make reasonable estimates of fair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the anticipated removal and replacement of USTs. Our accrual of this future environmental liability represents our estimate of the fair value of the cost for each component of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience. In arriving at our accrual, we analyzed the ages and expected useful lives of USTs at properties where we would be responsible for preexisting unknown environmental contamination and we projected a cost to closure for remediation of such contamination. We measure our environmental remediation liabilities at fair value based on expected future net cash flows, adjusted for inflation and then discount them to present value. We adjust our environmental remediation liabilities quarterly to reflect changes in projected expenditures, changes in present value due to the passage of time and reductions in estimated liabilities as a result of actual expenditures incurred during each quarter. As of September 30, 2024 , we had accrued a total of million for our prospective environmental remediation obligations. This accrual consisted of (a) million, which was our estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation liability, including obligations to remove USTs for which we are responsible, net of estimated recoveries and (b) million for future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination. As of December 31, 2023 , we had accrued a total of million for our prospective environmental remediation obligations. This accrual consisted of (a) million, which was our estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation liability, including obligations to remove USTs for which we are responsible, net of estimated recoveries and (b) million for future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination. Environmental liabilities are accreted for the change in present value due to the passage of time and, accordingly, million and million of net accretion expense was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in environmental expenses. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded credits to environmental expenses aggregating million and million, respectively, where decreases in estimated remediation costs exceeded the depreciated carrying value of previously capitalized asset retirement costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, changes in environmental estimates aggregating million and thousand, respectively, were related to properties that were previously disposed of by us. Environmental expenses also include project management fees, legal fees, and environmental litigation accruals. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we increased the carrying values of certain of our properties by million and million, respectively, due to changes in estimated environmental remediation costs. The recognition and subsequent changes in estimates in environmental liabilities and the increase or decrease in carrying values of the properties are non-cash transactions which do not appear on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Capitalized asset retirement costs are being depreciated over the estimated remaining life of the UST, a -year period if the increase in carrying value is related to environmental remediation obligations or such shorter period if circumstances warrant, such as the remaining lease term for properties we lease from others. Depreciation and amortization expense related to capitalized asset retirement costs on our consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were million and million, respectively. Capitalized asset retirement costs were million (consisting of million of known environmental liabilities and million of reserves for future environmental liabilities) as of September 30, 2024 , and million (consisting of million of known environmental liabilities and million of reserves for future environmental liabilities) as of December 31, 2023. We recorded impairment charges aggregating million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for capitalized asset retirement costs. Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the amount of data available upon initial assessment of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to allocation of responsibilities to others, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval. In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider, among other things, laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates

-year pollution legal liability insurance policy covering substantially all of our properties at that time for discovery of preexisting unknown environmental liabilities and for new environmental events. The policy had a million aggregate limit and was subject to various self-insured retentions and other conditions and limitations. This policy expired in July 2022, although claims made prior to such expiration remain subject to coverage. In September 2022, we purchased a -year pollution legal liability insurance policy to cover a subset of our properties which we believe present the greatest risk for discovery of preexisting unknown environmental liabilities and for new environmental events. The policy has a million in aggregate limit and is subject to various self-insured retentions and other conditions and limitations. Our intention in purchasing this policy was to obtain protection for certain properties which we believe have the greatest risk of significant environmental events. In light of the uncertainties associated with environmental expenditure contingencies, we are unable to estimate ranges in excess of the amount accrued with any certainty; however, we believe that it is possible that the fair value of future actual net expenditures could be substantially higher than amounts currently recorded by us. Adjustments to accrued liabilities for environmental remediation obligations will be reflected on our consolidated financial statements as they become probable and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.

On March 1, 2024, our Board of Directors granted restricted stock units RSU or RSUs ), under our Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan. On March 1, 2023, our Board of Directors granted RSUs under our Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan. Common Stock Offerings In July 2024, we completed a follow-on public offering of million shares of common stock in connection with forward sales agreements (the "July 2024 Forward Offering"). Upon settlement, the July 2024 Forward Offering is anticipated to raise total gross proceeds of approximately million. shares were settled during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we expect to settle the forward sale agreements in full within 12 months via physical delivery of the outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds. In February 2023, we completed a follow-on public offering the "February 2023 Forward Offering") of million shares of common stock in connection with forward sales agreements . During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we settled million shares of common stock from the February 2023 Forward Offering, realizing net proceeds of million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we settled all million shares and realized net proceeds of million. ATM Program In February 2023, we established and, in February 2024, we amended, an at-the-market equity offering program (the ATM Program ), pursuant to which we are able to issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to million through a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents or acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers pursuant to a forward sale agreement. Sales of the shares of common stock may be made, as needed, from time to time in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, including by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or as otherwise agreed to with the applicable agent. The use of a forward sale agreement allows us to lock in a share price on the sale of shares at the time the forward sales agreement becomes effective, but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date. To account for the forward sale agreements, we consider the accounting guidance governing financial instruments and derivatives. To date, we have concluded that our forward sale agreements are not liabilities as they do not embody obligations to repurchase our shares nor do they embody obligations to issue a variable number of shares for which the monetary value are predominantly fixed, varying with something other than the fair value of the shares, or varying inversely in relation to our shares. We also evaluated whether the agreements meet the derivatives and hedging guidance scope exception to be accounted for as equity instruments. We concluded that the agreements are classifiable as equity

shares of common stock were issued under the ATM Program. Future sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, determinations by us of the appropriate sources of funding for us and potential uses of funding available to us. ATM Forward Sale Agreements During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not enter into any forward sale agreements under the ATM Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into forward sale agreements to sell an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an average gross offering price of per share and, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we entered into forward sale agreements to sell an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an average gross offering price of per share. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we settled million shares and million shares, respectively, of common stock subject to forward sale agreements under the ATM Program for net proceeds of million and million, respectively, after deducting fees and expenses and making certain other adjustments as provided in the equity distribution agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we settled million shares of common stock subject to forward sale agreements under the ATM Program for net proceeds of million, after deducting fees and expenses and making certain other adjustments as provided in the equity distribution agreement. As September 30, 2024, we had million shares of common stock outstanding subject to forward sale agreements under the ATM Program. We expect to settle the forward sale agreements in full within 12 months of the respective agreement dates via physical delivery of the outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds, although we may elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the forward sale agreements, subject to certain conditions. Dividends For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we paid regular quarterly dividends of million or per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we paid regular quarterly dividends of million or per share. Dividend Reinvestment Plan Our dividend reinvestment plan provides our common stockholders with a convenient and economical method of acquiring additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their dividend distributions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we issued and shares of common stock, respectively, under the dividend reinvestment plan and received proceeds of approximately thousand and thousand, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense using the fair value method was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and is included in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of operations.

million and million, respectively. The fair value of the borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was determined using a discounted cash flow technique that incorporates a market interest yield curve with adjustments for duration, risk profile and borrowings outstanding, which are based on unobservable inputs within Level 3 of the Fair Value Hierarchy. Derivative Instruments We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis of the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. As of September 30, 2024, we had assessed the overall valuation of our derivative positions and determined that derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the Fair Value Hierarchy. The fair value of these liability instruments was million and is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, net on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Supplemental Retirement Plan We have mutual fund assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. We have a Supplemental Retirement Plan for executives. The amounts held in trust under the Supplemental Retirement Plan using Level 2 inputs may be used to satisfy claims of general creditors in the event of our or any of our subsidiaries bankruptcy. We have liability to the executives participating in the Supplemental Retirement Plan for the participant account balances equal to the aggregate of the amount invested at the executives direction and the income earned in such mutual funds.

Due to the subjectivity inherent in the internal valuation techniques used in estimating fair value, the amounts realized from the sale of such assets may vary significantly from these estimates.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANA LYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023; and Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Statements preceded by, followed by, or that otherwise include the words believes, expects, seeks, plans, projects, estimates, anticipates, predicts and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will, should, would, may and could are generally forward-looking in nature and are not historical facts. (All capitalized and undefined terms used in this section shall have the same meanings hereafter defined in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.) 
 Examples of forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, our statements regarding our network of convenience stores, express tunnel car washes, automotive service centers, automotive parts retailers, and certain other freestanding retailers, including drive thru quick service restaurants; substantial compliance of our properties with federal, state, and local provisions enacted or adopted pertaining to environmental matters; the effects of U.S. federal tax reform and other legislative, regulatory, and administrative developments; the impact of existing legislation and regulations on our competitive position; our prospective future environmental liabilities, including those resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination; negative impacts from geopolitical uncertainty on the global economy or on our tenants businesses, financial position or results of operations, including from COVID-19 or outbreaks of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, and terrorist attacks and other acts of violence, including current conflicts in Europe and the Middle East; quantifiable trends, which we believe allow us to make reasonable estimates of fair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the removal and replacement of underground storage tanks ("UST"); the impact of our redevelopment efforts related to certain of our properties; the amount of revenue we expect to realize from our properties; our belief that our owned and leased properties are adequately covered by casualty and liability insurance; our workplace demographics, recruiting efforts, and employee compensation program; funds from operations FFO and adjusted funds from operations AFFO as measures that represent our core operating performance and their utility in comparing our core operating performance between periods; the reasonableness of our estimates, judgments, projections, and assumptions used regarding our accounting policies and methods; our critical accounting policies; our exposure and liability due to and our accruals, estimates, and assumptions regarding our environmental liabilities and remediation costs; loan loss reserves or allowances; our belief that our accruals for environmental and litigation matters, including matters related to our former Newark, New Jersey Terminal and the Lower Passaic River, our MTBE multi-district litigation cases in the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland, were appropriate based on the information then available; our claims for reimbursement of monies expended in the defense and settlement of certain MTBE cases under pollution insurance policies; compliance with federal, state, and local provisions enacted or adopted pertaining to environmental matters; our beliefs about the settlement proposals we receive and the probable outcome of litigation or regulatory actions and their impact on us; our expected recoveries from UST funds; our indemnification obligations and the indemnification obligations of others; our investment strategy and its impact on our financial performance; the adequacy of our current and anticipated cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and available cash and cash equivalents; our continued compliance with the covenants in our credit and notes agreements; the amounts and timing for closing and funding of any new senior unsecured notes, and subsequent use of proceeds toward repayment of our Series C Notes (as defined below); our belief that certain environmental liabilities can be allocated to others under various agreements; our belief that our real estate assets are not carried at amounts in excess of their estimated net realizable fair value amounts; our beliefs regarding our properties, including their alternative uses and our ability to sell or lease our vacant properties over time; and our ability to maintain our federal tax status as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"). 
 These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and assumptions and information currently available to us, and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and were derived utilizing numerous important assumptions that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors and assumptions involved in the derivation of forward-looking statements, and the failure of such other assumptions to be realized as well as other factors may also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond our control. These factors and assumptions may have an impact on the continued accuracy of any forward-looking statements that we make. 
 26 

Factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations include, but are not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our public filings, and risks associated with: complying with environmental laws and regulations and the costs associated with complying with such laws and regulations; substantially all of our tenants depending on the same industry for their revenues; the creditworthiness of our tenants; our tenants compliance with their lease obligations; renewal of existing leases and our ability to either re-lease or sell properties; our dependence on external sources of capital; counterparty risks; the uncertainty of our estimates, judgments, projections and assumptions associated with our accounting policies and methods; our ability to successfully manage our investment strategy; potential future acquisitions and redevelopment opportunities; changes in interest rates and our ability to manage or mitigate this risk effectively; owning and leasing real estate; our business operations generating sufficient cash for distributions or debt service; adverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions; adverse effect of inflation; federal tax reform; property taxes; potential exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims; owning real estate primarily concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States; competition in our industry; the adequacy of our insurance coverage and that of our tenants; failure to qualify as a REIT; dilution as a result of future issuances of equity securities; our dividend policy, ability to pay dividends and changes to our dividend policy; changes in market conditions; provisions in our corporate charter and by-laws; Maryland law discouraging a third-party takeover; the loss of a member or members of our management team or Board of Directors; changes in accounting standards; future impairment charges; terrorist attacks and other acts of violence and war; our information systems; failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting; and negative impacts from the continued presence of COVID-19, including on the global economy or on our tenants businesses, financial position, or results of operations. 
 As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, our growth or reinvestment strategies, our ability to pay dividends or stock price. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned above and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. 
 You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our view only as of the date hereof. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless required by law. For any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or in any other document, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
 General 
 Real Estate Investment Trust 
 We are a net lease REIT specializing in the acquisition, financing and development of convenience, automotive and other single tenant retail real estate. Our portfolio is comprised of convenience stores, express tunnel car washes, automotive service centers (gasoline and repair, oil and maintenance, tire and battery, and collision), and certain other freestanding retail properties, including drive thru quick service restaurants and automotive parts retailers. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio included 1,108 properties, including 1,074 properties owned by us and 34 properties that we leased from third-party landlords. As a REIT, we are not subject to federal corporate income tax on the taxable income we distribute to our stockholders. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90 of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders each year. 
 Our Triple-Net Leases 
 Substantially all of our properties are leased on a triple-net basis to convenience store operators, petroleum distributors, express tunnel car wash operators and other automotive-related and retail tenants. Our tenants either operate their business at our properties directly or, in the case of certain convenience stores and gasoline and repair stations, sublet our properties and supply fuel to third parties that operate the business. Our triple-net lease tenants are responsible for the payment of all taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance and other operating expenses relating to our properties, and are also responsible for environmental contamination occurring during the terms of their leases. Substantially all of our tenants are also responsible for pre-existing environmental contamination that is discovered during their lease term, except contamination that was known at lease commencement, as to which we have established reserves. 
 The majority of our tenants financial results depend on convenience store sales, the sale of refined petroleum products and/or the sale of automotive services and parts. As a result, our tenants financial results can be dependent on the performance of the consumer retail, petroleum marketing, automobile manufacturing, and automobile aftermarket industries, each of which are highly competitive and can be subject to variability. For additional information regarding our real estate business, our properties, and environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Company Operations and Item 2. Properties in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Environmental Matters below. 
 27 

Our Properties 
 Our 1,108 properties are located in 42 states and Washington D.C. and include a concentration in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions that we believe is unique and not readily available for purchase or lease from other owners or landlords. Our typical property consists of approximately one acre of land in a larger metropolitan area and is used as a convenience store, express tunnel car wash, automotive service center, or certain other freestanding retailers, including drive thru quick service restaurants and automotive parts retailers. Many of our properties are located at highly trafficked urban intersections or conveniently close to highway entrances or exit ramps. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we leased 1,104 of our properties to tenants under triple-net leases, including 913 properties leased under 47 separate unitary or master triple-net leases, and 191 properties leased under single unit triple-net leases. These leases generally provide for an initial term of 15 or 20 years, with options for successive renewal terms of up to 20 years, and periodic rent escalations. As of September 30, 2024, our weighted average remaining lease term, excluding renewal options, was 10.1 years. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were also actively redeveloping one of our properties for alternative single tenant retail uses, and three of our properties were vacant. 
 Investment Strategy and Activity 
 As part of our strategy to grow and diversify our portfolio, we regularly review acquisition and financing opportunities to invest in additional convenience, automotive and other single tenant retail real estate. We primarily pursue sale leaseback transactions with existing and prospective tenants and will pursue other transactions, including forward commitments to acquire new-to-industry construction and the acquisition of assets with in-place leases, that result in us owning fee simple interests in our properties. Our investment activities may also include purchase money financing with respect to properties we sell, real property loans relating to our leasehold properties, and construction loans or other property development financing. Our investment strategy seeks to generate current income and benefit from long-term appreciation in the underlying value of our real estate. To achieve that goal, we seek to invest in well-located, freestanding properties that support automobility and provide convenience and service to consumers in major markets across the country. A key element of our investment strategy is to invest in properties that will enhance our property type, tenant, and geographic diversification. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 132.5 million (net of amounts funded in prior periods) across 60 properties, including the acquisition of fee simple interests in 29 express tunnel car washes, 17 auto service centers, three drive thru quick service restaurants, and three convenience stores. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we invested 266.7 million across 70 properties (net of amounts funded in prior periods), including the acquisition of fee simple interests in 23 express tunnel car washes, 10 convenience stores, three drive thru quick service restaurants and one auto service center. 
 Redevelopment Strategy and Activity 
 We believe that certain of our properties, primarily those currently being used as gas and repair businesses, are well-suited to be redeveloped as modern convenience stores or other single tenant convenience and automotive retail uses, such as automotive parts retailers, quick service restaurants, auto service centers, and bank branches. We believe that the redeveloped properties can be leased or sold at higher values than their prior use. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, rent commenced on one completed redevelopment project that was placed back into service in our net lease portfolio. Since the inception of our redevelopment program in 2015, we have completed 32 redevelopment projects. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had one property under active redevelopment and several others in various stages of feasibility planning for potential recapture from our net lease portfolio. 
 Recent Financing Activity 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we received commitments from certain lenders for 125.0 million of new senior unsecured notes, including (i) 50.0 million of 5.52 senior unsecured notes due September 2029, and (ii) 75.0 million of 5.70 senior unsecured notes due February 2032. We anticipate the transaction will close during the three months ending December 31, 2024 with funding occurring during the three months ending March 31, 2025, although there can be no assurance that the transaction will be executed according to these dates, or at all. Use of proceeds would include (i) the repayment of 50.0 million of 4.75 Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 25, 2025 (the Series C Notes ), and (ii) general corporate purposes, including to fund investment activity. 
 28 

Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures 
 In addition to measurements defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), we also focus on FFO and AFFO to measure our performance. 
 FFO and AFFO are generally considered by analysts and investors to be appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measures of the performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO and AFFO are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash generated from operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP and therefore these measures should not be considered an alternative for GAAP net earnings or as a measure of liquidity. These measures should only be used to evaluate our performance in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures. 
 FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT as GAAP net earnings before (i) depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, (ii) gains or losses on dispositions of real estate assets, (iii) impairment charges, and (iv) the cumulative effect of accounting changes. 
 We define AFFO as FFO excluding (i) certain revenue recognition adjustments (defined below), (ii) certain environmental adjustments (defined below), (iii) stock-based compensation, (iv) amortization of debt issuance costs, and (v) other non-cash and/or unusual items that are not reflective of our core operating performance. 
 Other REITs may use definitions of FFO and/or AFFO that are different than ours and, accordingly, may not be comparable. 
 We believe that FFO and AFFO are helpful to analysts and investors in measuring our performance because both FFO and AFFO exclude various items included in GAAP net earnings that do not relate to, or are not indicative of, the core operating performance of our portfolio. Specifically, FFO excludes items such as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains or losses on dispositions of real estate assets, and impairment charges. With respect to AFFO, we further exclude the impact of (i) deferred rental revenue (straight-line rent), the net amortization of intangible market lease assets and liabilities, adjustments recorded for the recognition of rental income from direct financing leases, and the amortization of deferred lease incentives (collectively, Revenue Recognition Adjustments ), (ii) environmental accretion expenses, environmental litigation accruals, insurance reimbursements, legal settlements and judgments, and changes in environmental remediation estimates (collectively, Environmental Adjustments ), (iii) stock-based compensation expense, (iv) amortization of debt issuance costs, and (v) other items, which may include allowances for credit losses on notes and mortgages receivable and direct financing leases, losses on extinguishment of debt, retirement and severance costs, and other items that do not impact our recurring cash flow and which are not indicative of our core operating performance. 
 We pay particular attention to AFFO which we believe provides the most useful depiction of the core operating performance of our portfolio. By providing AFFO, we believe we are presenting information that assists analysts and investors in their assessment of our core operating performance, as well as comparing the sustainability of our core operating performance with the sustainability of the core operating performance of other real estate companies.

Rental income includes base rental income and additional rental income, if any, based on the aggregate volume of fuel sold at certain properties. The increase in rental income was primarily due to additional base rental income from new property acquisitions, as well as rent commencements from completed redevelopments and contractual rent increases for certain in-place leases, partially offset by dispositions of real estate. 
 In accordance with GAAP, we recognize revenues from rental properties in amounts which vary from the amount of rent contractually due during the periods presented. As a result, revenues from rental properties include revenue recognition adjustments comprised of (i) non-cash adjustments recorded for deferred rental revenue due to the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the current lease term, (ii) the net amortization of intangible market lease assets and liabilities, (iii) recognition of rental income under direct financing leases using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties, and (iv) the amortization of deferred lease incentives. 
 Tenant reimbursements consist of real estate taxes and other municipal charges paid by us which are reimbursable by our tenants pursuant to the terms of our triple-net lease agreements. 
 Interest on Notes and Mortgages Receivable 
 The decrease in interest on notes and mortgages receivable was due to a decrease in average development funding balances primarily due to repayments in connection with the acquisition of the related properties.

Property Costs 
 The following table presents the results for property costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 (in thousands):

(4,783) 

Property costs are comprised of (i) property operating expenses, including rent expense, reimbursable and non-reimbursable real estate taxes and municipal charges, certain state and local taxes, and maintenance expenses, and (ii) leasing and redevelopment expenses, including professional fees, demolition costs, and redevelopment project cost write-offs, if any. 
 The decrease in property operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in reimbursable and non-reimbursable real estate taxes. The decrease in leasing and redevelopment expenses was due to lower professional fees and demolition costs, partially offset by certain redevelopment project write-offs. 
 Impairment Charges 
 Impairment charges are recorded when the carrying value of a property is reduced to fair value. Impairment charges for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were attributable to (i) the effect of adding asset retirement costs to certain properties due to changes in estimates associated with our environmental liabilities, which increased the carrying values of these properties in excess of their fair values. 
 Environmental Expenses 
 The decrease in environmental expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to changes in environmental estimates and lower accretion expense. Environmental expenses vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of change in reported environmental expenses for one period, as compared to prior periods. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses and certain professional fees. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses was primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from properties acquired during the prior 12 months, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation charges related to asset retirement costs, the effect of certain assets becoming fully depreciated, lease terminations, and dispositions of real estate during the same period. 
 (Loss) Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 we recorded a loss on dispositions of real estate related to the 23 properties sold to Global as part of a unitary lease amendment. See Note 3 Leases. 
 Interest Expense 
 The increase in interest expense was due to higher average borrowings and higher average interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Rental income includes base rental income and additional rental income, if any, based on the aggregate volume of fuel sold at certain properties. The increase in rental income was primarily due to additional base rental income from new property acquisitions, as well as rent commencements from completed redevelopments and contractual rent increases for certain in-place leases, partially offset by dispositions of real estate. 
 In accordance with GAAP, we recognize revenues from rental properties in amounts which vary from the amount of rent contractually due during the periods presented. As a result, revenues from rental properties include revenue recognition adjustments comprised of (i) non-cash adjustments recorded for deferred rental revenue due to the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the current lease term, (ii) the net amortization of intangible market lease assets and liabilities, (iii) recognition of rental income under direct financing leases using the effective interest rate method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investments in the leased properties, and (iv) the amortization of deferred lease incentives. 
 Tenant reimbursements consist of real estate taxes and other municipal charges paid by us which are reimbursable by our tenants pursuant to the terms of our triple-net lease agreements. 
 Interest on Notes and Mortgages Receivable 
 The increase in interest on notes and mortgages receivable was primarily due to an increase in development funding advances for the construction of new-to-industry properties, as well as higher development funding rates, partially offset by collections of notes and mortgages receivable.

 Impairment Charges 
 Impairment charges are recorded when the carrying value of a property is reduced to fair value. Impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were attributable to (i) the effect of adding asset retirement costs to certain properties due to changes in estimates associated with our environmental liabilities, which increased the carrying values of these properties in excess of their fair values, (ii) reductions in estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be received during the assumed holding period for certain of our properties, and (iii) reductions in estimated sales prices from third-party offers based on signed contracts, letters of intent or indicative bids for certain of our properties. 
 Environmental Expenses 
 The decrease in environmental expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to changes in environmental estimates and lower accretion expenses. Environmental expenses vary from period to period and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the magnitude or the direction of change in reported environmental expenses for one period, as compared to prior periods. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses and certain professional fees, partially offset by a decrease in non-recurring retirement and severance costs and legal fees. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses was primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from properties acquired during the prior 12 months, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation charges related to asset retirement costs, the effect of certain assets becoming fully depreciated, lease terminations, and dispositions of real estate during the same period. 
 (Loss) Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate 
 The loss on dispositions of real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the 23 properties sold to Global as part of a unitary lease amendment. See Note 3 Leases. The gain on dispositions of real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the sale of a two properties during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 The increase in interest expense was due to higher average borrowings and higher average interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our primary uses of liquidity include payments of operating expenses, interest on our outstanding debt, environmental remediation costs, distributions to shareholders, and future acquisitions and redevelopment projects. We have not historically incurred significant capital expenditures other than those related to acquisitions. 
 We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through cash flow from operations, funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility, funds under our Term Loan, proceeds from the settlement of shares of common stock subject to forward sale agreements under our ATM Program, and available cash and cash equivalents. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 287.5 million of availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, 4.4 million shares of common stock subject to forward sale agreements which are anticipated to generate approximately 132.5 million of gross proceeds upon settlement, and available cash and cash equivalents of 4.0 million. 
 We anticipate meeting our longer-term capital needs through cash flow from operations, funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility, available cash and cash equivalents, the future issuance of shares of common stock or debt securities, and proceeds from future real estate asset sales. 
 Our cash flow activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Operating Activities 
 The change in net cash flow provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in Results of Operations above and the other changes in assets and liabilities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 Investing Activities 
 The decrease in net cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to a 75.4 million increase in collections of notes and mortgages receivable, a 67.3 million decrease in issuance of notes and mortgages receivable, and a 1.3 million increase in proceeds from dispositions of real estate, partially offset by an 11.5 million increase in property acquisitions and a 4.2 million decrease in deposits for property acquisitions. 
 Financing Activities 
 The decrease in net cash flow provided by financing activities was primarily due to an 83.0 million decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the ATM Program, a 71.7 million decrease in net proceeds from Common Stock Offerings, a 50.0 million decrease in net proceeds from Senior Unsecured Notes, an 11.0 million increase in cash dividends paid, and a 2.5 million decrease in net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by a 75.0 million increase in proceeds under the Term Loan. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 In October 2021, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (as amended, the Second Restated Credit Agreement ). The Second Restated Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of 300.0 million and includes an accordion feature to increase the revolving commitments or add one or more tranches of term loans up to an additional aggregate amount not to exceed 300.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including one or more new or existing lenders agreeing to provide commitments for such increased amount and that no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility matures October 27, 2025, subject to two six-month extensions (for a total of 12 months) exercisable at our option. Our exercise of an extension option is subject to the absence of any default and our compliance with certain conditions, including the payment of extension fees to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 35 

In December 2022, we entered into the First Amendment to the Second Restated Credit Agreement to transition the applicable interest rates and default rate thereunder from LIBOR-based rates to SOFR-based rates. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the sum of a SOFR rate plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 plus a margin of 1.30 to 1.90 , or (ii) the sum of a base rate plus a margin of 0.30 to 0.90 based on our consolidated total indebtedness to total asset value ratio at the end of each quarterly reporting period. 
 The per annum rate of the unused line fee on the undrawn funds under the Revolving Credit Facility is 0.15 to 0.25 based on our daily unused portion of the available Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Term Loan 
 In October 2023, we entered into a term loan credit agreement (the Term Loan Agreement that provides for a senior unsecured term loan (the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of 150.0 million. The Term Loan matures October 17, 2025, subject to one twelve-month extension exercisable at our option. Our exercise of the extension option is subject to the absence of any default and our compliance with certain conditions, including the payment of extension fees to the lenders under the Term Loan. 
 The Term Loan is comprised of (i) an initial principal amount of 75.0 million that was funded in a single draw at closing and used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, and (ii) an additional principal amount of 75.0 million that was funded in a single draw in April 2024. 
 Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the sum of a SOFR rate plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 plus a margin of 1.30 to 1.90 , or (ii) the sum of a base rate plus a margin of 0.30 to 0.90 , in each case with the margin based on our consolidated total indebtedness to total asset value ratio at the end of each quarterly reporting period. In connection with the Term Loan, we entered into interest rate swaps for a notional amount of 150.0 million to fix SOFR at weighted average of 4.73 until maturity. Including the impact of the swaps, the effective interest rate on the Term Loan is 6.13 based on our consolidated total indebtedness. 
 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 In February 2022, we entered into a sixth amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Prudential (the "Sixth Amended and Restated Prudential Agreement") pursuant to which, in January 2023, we issued 80.0 million of 3.65 Series Q Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 20, 2033 (the Series Q Notes to Prudential and used the proceeds to repay the 75.0 million of 5.35 Series B Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 2, 2023 (the Series B Notes outstanding under its fifth amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with Prudential (the "Fifth Amended and Restated Prudential Agreement"). The other senior unsecured notes outstanding under the Fifth Amended and Restated Prudential Agreement, including (i) 50.0 million of 4.75 Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 25, 2025, (ii) 50.0 million of 5.47 Series D Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 21, 2028 (the Series D Notes ), (iii) 50.0 million of 3.52 Series F Guaranteed Senior Notes due September 12, 2029 (the Series F Notes ), and (iv) 100.0 million of 3.43 Series I Guaranteed Senior Notes due November 25, 2030 (the Series I Notes ), remain outstanding under the Sixth Amended and Restated Prudential Agreement. 
 In February 2022, we entered into a second amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with American General Life Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, AIG (the Second Amended and Restated AIG Agreement pursuant to which we issued 55.0 million of 3.45 Series L Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 22, 2032 (the Series L Notes to AIG. The other senior unsecured notes outstanding under our first amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with AIG (the First Amended and Restated AIG Agreement ), including (i) 50.0 million of 3.52 Series G Guaranteed Senior Notes due September 12, 2029 (the Series G Notes ), and (ii) 50.0 million of 3.43 Series J Guaranteed Senior Notes due November 25, 2030 (the Series J Notes ), remain outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated AIG Agreement. 
 In February 2022, we entered into a second amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, MassMutual (the Second Amended and Restated MassMutual Agreement pursuant to which we issued 20.0 million of 3.45 Series M Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 22, 2032 (the Series M Notes and, in January 2023, 20.0 million of 3.65 Series O Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 20, 2033 (the Series O Notes to MassMutual. The other senior unsecured notes outstanding under our first amended and restated note purchase and guarantee agreement with MassMutual (the First Amended and Restated MassMutual Agreement ), including (i) 25.0 million of 3.52 Series H Guaranteed Senior Notes due September 12, 2029 (the Series H Notes ), and (ii) 25.0 million of 3.43 Series K Guaranteed Senior Notes due November 25, 2030 (the Series K Notes ), remain outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated MassMutual Agreement. 
 36 

In February 2022, we entered into a note purchase and guarantee agreement with New York Life Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, New York Life (the New York Life Agreement pursuant to which we issued 25.0 million of 3.45 Series N Guaranteed Senior Notes due February 22, 2032 (the Series N Notes and, in January 2023, 25.0 million of 3.65 Series P Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 20, 2033 (the Series P Notes to New York Life. 
 On June 21, 2018, we entered into a note purchase and guarantee agreement with MetLife and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "MetLife") (the MetLife Agreement pursuant to which we issued 50.0 million of 5.47 Series E Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 21, 2028 (the Series E Notes to MetLife. 
 The funded and outstanding Series C Notes, Series D Notes, Series E Notes, Series F Note, Series G Notes, Series H Notes, Series I Notes, Series J Notes, Series K Notes, Series L Notes, Series M Notes, Series N Notes, Series O Notes, Series P Notes and Series Q Notes are collectively referred to the "Senior Unsecured Notes". 
 Common Stock Offerings 
 In July 2024, we completed a follow-on public offering of 4.0 million shares of common stock in connection with forward sales agreements (the "July 2024 Forward Offering"). Upon settlement, the July 2024 Forward Offering is anticipated to raise total gross proceeds of approximately 121.1 million. We expect to settle the forward sale agreements in full within 12 months via physical delivery of the outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds. 
 In February 2023, we completed a follow-on public offering of 3.5 million shares of common stock in connection with forward sales agreements. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we settled 2.2 million shares of common stock from the February 2023 Forward Offering, realizing net proceeds of 71.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we settled all 3.5 million shares and realized net proceeds of 112.1 million. 
 ATM Program 
 In February 2023, we established and, in February 2024, we amended, an at-the-market equity offering program (the ATM Program ), pursuant to which we are able to issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to 350.0 million through a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents or acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers pursuant to a forward sale agreement. Sales of the shares of common stock may be made, as needed, from time to time in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, including by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or as otherwise agreed to with the applicable agent. The use of a forward sale agreement allows us to lock in a share price on the sale of shares at the time the forward sales agreement becomes effective, but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date. To account for the forward sale agreements, we consider the accounting guidance governing financial instruments and derivatives. To date, we have concluded that our forward sale agreements are not liabilities as they do not embody obligations to repurchase our shares nor do they embody obligations to issue a variable number of shares for which the monetary value are predominantly fixed, varying with something other than the fair value of the shares, or varying inversely in relation to our shares. We also evaluated whether the agreements meet the derivatives and hedging guidance scope exception to be accounted for as equity instruments. We concluded that the agreements are classifiable as equity contracts based on the following assessments: (i) none of the agreements exercise contingencies are based on observable markets or indices besides those related to the market for our own stock price and operations, and (ii) none of the settlement provisions precluded the agreements from being indexed to its own stock. We also consider the potential dilution resulting from the forward sale agreements on the earnings per share calculations. We use the treasury stock method to determine the dilution resulting from the forward sale agreements during the period of time prior to settlement. 
 ATM Direct Issuances 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no shares of common stock were issued under the ATM Program. Future sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, determinations by us of the appropriate sources of funding for us and potential uses of funding available to us. 
 ATM Forward Sale Agreements 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not enter into any forward sale agreements under the ATM Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into forward sale agreements to sell an aggregate of 0.4 million shares of common stock at an average gross offering price of 27.98 per share and, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we entered into forward sale agreements to sell an aggregate of 0.2 million shares of common stock at an average gross offering price of 34.97 per share. 
 37 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we settled 0.8 million shares and 1.0 million shares, respectively, of common stock subject to forward sale agreements under the ATM Program for net proceeds of 23.9 million and 31.1 million, respectively, after deducting fees and expenses and making certain other adjustments as provided in the equity distribution agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we settled 3.7 million shares of common stock subject to forward sale agreements under the ATM Program for net proceeds of 114.1 million, after deducting fees and expenses and making certain other adjustments as provided in the equity distribution agreement. 
 As September 30, 2024, we had 0.4 million shares of common stock outstanding subject to forward sale agreements under the ATM Program. We expect to settle the forward sale agreements in full within 12 months of the respective agreement dates via physical delivery of the outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds, although we may elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the forward sale agreements, subject to certain conditions. 
 Dividends 
 We elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws with the year beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. We cannot provide any assurance that our cash flows will permit us to continue paying cash dividends. 
 It is also possible that instead of distributing 100 of our taxable income on an annual basis, we may decide to retain a portion of our taxable income and to pay taxes on such amounts as permitted by the Internal Revenue Service. Payment of dividends is subject to market conditions, our financial condition, including but not limited to, our continued compliance with the provisions of the credit and notes agreements and other factors, and therefore is not assured. In particular, our Restated Credit Agreement, Term Loan Agreement, and Senior Unsecured Notes prohibit the payment of dividends during certain events of default. 
 Regular quarterly dividends paid to our stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 74.8 million, or 1.35 per share. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates, if at all. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported on our consolidated financial statements. Although we have made estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding future uncertainties relating to the information included on our consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to the accounting policies selected and materiality, actual results could differ from these estimates, judgments and assumptions and such differences could be material. 
 Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, real estate, receivables, deferred rent receivable, direct financing leases, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, environmental remediation obligations, litigation, accrued liabilities, income taxes and the allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The information included on our consolidated financial statements that is based on estimates, judgments and assumptions is subject to significant change and is adjusted as circumstances change and as the uncertainties become more clearly defined. 
 Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The SEC s Financial Reporting Release FRR No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies FRR 60 ), suggests that companies provide additional disclosure on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. We believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and deferred rent receivable, direct financing leases, impairment of long-lived assets, environmental remediation obligations, litigation, income taxes, and the allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (collectively, our Critical Accounting Policies ), each of which is discussed in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Environmental Matters 
 General 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to the protection of the environment such as the remediation of known contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Environmental costs are principally attributable to remediation costs which are incurred for, among other things, removing USTs, excavation of contaminated soil and water, installing, operating, maintaining and decommissioning remediation systems, monitoring contamination and governmental agency compliance reporting required in connection with contaminated properties. 
 38 

We enter into leases and various other agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. We are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the event that our tenant does not satisfy them, and we are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under our leases if we determine that it is probable that our tenant will not meet its environmental obligations. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We assess whether to accrue for environmental liabilities based upon relevant factors including our tenants histories of paying for such obligations, our assessment of their financial capability, and their intent to pay for such obligations. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. As the property owner, we may ultimately be responsible for the payment of environmental liabilities if our tenant fails to pay them. 
 The estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The accrued liability is the aggregate of our estimate of the fair value of cost for each component of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience with the funds. 
 For substantially all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term (the cost of which is mainly the responsibility of our tenant but in certain cases partially paid for by us) and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. In addition, for substantially all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for known environmental contamination that existed at the commencement of the lease and for preexisting unknown environmental contamination that is discovered during the term of the lease. 
 For the subset of our triple-net leases which cover properties previously leased to Marketing (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), the allocation of responsibility differs from our other triple-net leases as it relates to preexisting known and unknown contamination. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing, we agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that was known at the time the lease commenced, and for unknown environmental contamination which existed prior to commencement of the lease and which is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first 10 years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases) (a Lookback Period ). Similarly, for certain properties previously leased to Marketing which we have sold, we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that was known at the time of the sale and for unknown environmental contamination which existed prior to the sale and which is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) within 5 years of the closing (also, a Lookback Period ). After expiration of the applicable Lookback Period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination at these properties, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease or sale, is the contractual responsibility of our tenant or buyer as the case may be. 
 Based on the expiration of the Lookback Periods, together with other factors which have significantly mitigated our potential liability for preexisting environmental obligations, including the absence of any contractual obligations relating to properties which have been sold, quantifiable trends associated with types and ages of USTs at issue, expectations regarding future UST replacements, and historical trends and expectations regarding discovery of preexisting unknown environmental contamination and/or attempted pursuit of the Company therefore, we concluded that there is no material continued risk of having to satisfy contractual obligations relating to preexisting unknown environmental contamination at certain properties. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, we had removed 24.2 million of unknown reserve liabilities which had previously been accrued for these properties. 
 We continue to anticipate that our tenants under leases where the Lookback Periods have expired will replace USTs in the years ahead as these USTs near the end of their expected useful lives. At many of these properties the USTs in use are fabricated with older generation materials and technologies and we believe it is prudent to expect that upon their removal preexisting unknown environmental contamination will be identified. Although contractually these tenants are now responsible for preexisting unknown environmental contamination that is discovered during UST replacements, because the applicable Lookback Periods have expired before the end of the initial term of these leases, together with other relevant factors, we believe there remains continued risk that we will be responsible for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination associated with future UST removals at certain properties. Accordingly, we believe it is appropriate at this time to maintain 11.8 million of unknown reserve liabilities for certain properties with respect to which the Lookback Periods have expired as of September 30, 2024. 
 In the course of UST removals and replacements at certain properties previously leased to Marketing where we retained responsibility for preexisting unknown environmental contamination until expiration of the applicable Lookback Period, environmental contamination has been and continues to be discovered. As a result, we developed an estimate of fair value for the prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination and accrued for these estimated costs. These estimates are based primarily upon quantifiable trends which we believe allow us to make reasonable estimates of fair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the anticipated removal and replacement of USTs. Our accrual of this future environmental liability represents our estimate of the fair value of the cost for each component of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience. In arriving at our accrual, we 
 39 

analyzed the ages and expected useful lives of USTs at properties where we would be responsible for preexisting unknown environmental contamination and we projected a cost to closure for remediation of such contamination. 
 We measure our environmental remediation liabilities at fair value based on expected future net cash flows, adjusted for inflation, and then discount them to present value. We adjust our environmental remediation liabilities quarterly to reflect changes in projected expenditures, changes in present value due to the passage of time and reductions in estimated liabilities as a result of actual expenditures incurred during each quarter. As of September 30, 2024, we had accrued a total of 20.8 million for our prospective environmental remediation obligations. This accrual consisted of (i) 9.0 million of known reserve liabilities which was our estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation liability, including obligations to remove USTs for which we are responsible, net of estimated recoveries, and (ii) 11.8 million of unknown reserve liabilities, which was our estimate of future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination. As of December 31, 2023, we had accrued a total of 22.4 million for our prospective environmental remediation obligations. This accrual consisted of (i) 9.9 million of known reserve liabilities, and (ii) 12.5 million of unknown reserve liabilities, which was our estimate of future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination. 
 Environmental liabilities are accreted for the change in present value due to the passage of time and, accordingly, 0.3 million and 0.4 million of net accretion expense was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in environmental expenses. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded credits to environmental expenses aggregating 0.8 million and 0.2 million, respectively, where decreases in estimated remediation costs exceeded the depreciated carrying value of previously capitalized asset retirement costs. Environmental expenses also include project management fees, legal fees and environmental litigation accruals. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we increased the carrying values of certain of our properties by 1.9 million and 3.2 million, respectively, due to changes in estimated environmental remediation costs. The recognition and subsequent changes in estimates in environmental liabilities and the increase or decrease in carrying values of the properties are non-cash transactions which do not appear on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 Capitalized asset retirement costs are being depreciated over the estimated remaining life of the UST, a 10-year period if the increase in carrying value is related to environmental remediation obligations or such shorter period if circumstances warrant, such as the remaining lease term for properties we lease from others. Depreciation and amortization expense related to capitalized asset retirement costs on our consolidated statements of operations was 2.0 million and 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Capitalized asset retirement costs were 33.6 million (consisting of 25.4 million of known environmental obligations and 8.2 million of reserves for future environmental obligations related to preexisting unknown contamination) as of September 30, 2024, and 34.3 million (consisting of 25.8 million of known environmental obligations and 8.5 million of reserves for future environmental obligations related to preexisting unknown contamination) as of December 31, 2023. We recorded impairment charges aggregating 1.6 million and 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for capitalized asset retirement costs. 
 Environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the amount of data available upon initial assessment of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to allocation of responsibilities to others, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval. In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider, among other things, laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates derived upon facts known to us at this time, which are subject to significant change as circumstances change, and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable. 
 Any changes to our estimates or our assumptions that form the basis of our estimates may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental remediation liabilities. 
 In July 2012, we purchased a 10-year pollution legal liability insurance policy covering substantially all of our properties at that time for discovery of preexisting unknown environmental liabilities and for new environmental events. The policy had a 50.0 million aggregate limit and was subject to various self-insured retentions and other conditions and limitations. This policy expired in July 2022, although claims made prior to such expiration remain subject to coverage. In September 2022, we purchased a 5-year pollution legal liability insurance policy to cover a subset of our properties which we believe present the greatest risk for discovery of preexisting unknown environmental liabilities and for new environmental events. The policy has a 25.0 million in aggregate limit and is subject to various self-insured retentions and other conditions and limitations. Our intention in purchasing this policy was to obtain protection for certain properties which we believe have the greatest risk of significant environmental events. 
 40 

In light of the uncertainties associated with environmental expenditure contingencies, we are unable to estimate ranges in excess of the amount accrued with any certainty; however, we believe that it is possible that the fair value of future actual net expenditures could be substantially higher than amounts currently recorded by us. Adjustments to accrued liabilities for environmental remediation obligations will be reflected on our consolidated financial statements as they become probable and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. 
 Environmental Litigation 
 We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of our business. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no amounts accrued for these matters which we believe were appropriate based on information then currently available. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental litigation accruals. Matters related to our former Newark, New Jersey Terminal and the Lower Passaic River, and our MTBE litigations in the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland, in particular, could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to these and other pending environmental lawsuits and claims, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings and Note 4 in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITA TIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility which bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the sum of a SOFR rate plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 plus a margin of 1.30 to 1.90 , or (ii) the sum of a base rate plus a margin of 0.30 to 0.90 based on our consolidated total indebtedness to total asset value ratio at the end of each quarterly reporting period. Based on our outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of 12.5 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase in market interest rates of 1.0 for 2024 would decrease our 2024 net income and cash flows by 31 thousand. 
 In order to minimize our exposure to credit risk associated with financial instruments, we place our temporary cash investments, if any, with high credit quality institutions. Temporary cash investments, if any, are currently held in an overnight bank time deposit with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and these balances, at times, may exceed federally insurable limits. 
 See Part II. Item. 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROL S AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the nine months ended, September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
