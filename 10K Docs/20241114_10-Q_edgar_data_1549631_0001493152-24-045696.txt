Notes

A
performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product to the customer, which for us is transfer of devices
to our customers. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods that will be transferred to the customer
that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods is separately
identifiable from other promises in the contract. We have concluded the sale of goods and related shipping and handling are accounted
for as the single performance obligation. 

The
transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the customer
receives the benefit of the performance obligation. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be
entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods to the customer. We issue refunds to e-commerce and print media customers, upon
request, within 30 days of delivery. We estimate the amount of potential refunds at each reporting period using a portfolio approach
of historical data, adjusted for changes in expected customer experience, including seasonality and changes in economic factors. For
retailers, distributors and wholesalers, we do not offer a right of return or refund and revenue is recognized at the time products are
shipped to customers. In all cases, judgment is required in estimating these reserves. Actual claims for returns could be materially
different from the estimates. There was reserve for sales returns and allowances, at September 30, 2024 and December 31. 2023, respectively. 

We
recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation in a contract by transferring control over a product to a customer when a
product is shipped. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing
transaction, that are collected by us from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound
freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfilment cost and are included in cost of
product sales. 

We
recognize consulting revenue over time as services are performed.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations 

The
following is management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and is provided as a supplement
to the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements and notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows during the periods included in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. 

In
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Company, the Company, us, and our refer to
Quarta-Rad, Inc., a Delaware corporation, unless the context requires otherwise. 

We
intend the following discussion to assist in the understanding of our financial position and our results of operations for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2022. You should refer to the Financial Statements and related Notes in conjunction with
this discussion. 

Results
of Operations 

General 

We
were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 29, 2011 with fiscal year end in December 31. We were formed to
distribute and sell detection devices to homeowners and interested consumers in North America. Initially, our business plan was to sell
products on consignment from Star Systems Japan, a corporation owned by our majority shareholder. We purchased these products from Quarta-Rad,
Ltd., a company owned by our minority shareholder. We also targeted direct-to-consumer sales since we believe we can distribute these
products through the Internet. We have never been party to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding, nor have we undergone
any material reclassification, merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of
business. 

Beginning in 2013, we began purchasing the products from Quarta-Rad, Ltd.,
our related party supplier and it shipped the products to us. We then shipped the products to a third-party online retailer, to hold for
Internet sales and sales to our third-party resellers 

During
April 2020, we acquired Quarta-Rad USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary. There was no consideration paid for
the shares. The purpose of the acquisition is to separate the sales of certain products in separate entities. There was no activity,
assets or liabilities in the subsidiary through March 31, 2024. 

During
December 2020, we acquired Sellavir, Inc. Sellavir is an AI company whose platform empowers organizations to decode videos to develop
creative marketing strategies and analysis through advanced and proprietary technologies. Sellavir is set to launch a new product specifically designed to simplify the use of complex cloud-based call center
platforms. 

Prior
to April 2024, our chief executive officer and director, Victor Shvetsky, and our director and president, Alexey Golovanov, were our
only employees. In April 2024, Mr. Golovanov resigned from the Company. 

We
were formed to distribute and sell detection devices, including Geiger counters, but we are currently expanding our focus to the development
and marketing of our call center software, CenterEye . CenterEye is designed to enhance call center operations through advanced
analytics and AI technologies. We are actively developing this software and pursuing sales opportunities in the U.S., Japan, and other
international markets. Recent traction in Japan indicates growing interest in our product. 

During
October 2024, the Company is exploring plans to potentially distribute its current operations of both Quarta-Rad and Sellavir and use
the company to support operations in alternate services lines. 

Our
administrative office is located at 1201 N. Orange St., Suite 700, Wilmington, DE 19801, which is a virtual office. 

15 

Our business strategy is expanding to the development
and marketing of CenterEye , our proprietary call center software. We aim to enhance call center efficiency and customer engagement
through innovative AI-driven solutions. While we maintain our online presence, our primary efforts are directed toward software development,
marketing, and establishing partnerships with call centers and businesses requiring advanced customer service solutions. 

Sellavir
Consulting: 

We
expanded our operations through the acquisition of Sellavir Inc. in December 2020. Sellavir is an AI company that leverages its knowledge
in neural networks to provide customized AI and development services to our clients. Our services are focused on offering customized
solutions for image processing. Our current business model relies on identifying the specific customer needs and developing a software
solution to address them. We currently do not have any clients in the US, and our sole revenue stream is from our Japanese reseller.
We rely on their sales staff for the identification of new opportunities in the Japanese market. Quarta-Rad has acquired the company
to: 

-
leverage Sellavir capabilities to combine it with its Radex series to offer AI-enhanced radiation detection capabilities 

 -
expand its scope outside the radiation measurement 

 -
recognizing the potential in the call center industry and leveraging Sellavir s, we are set to launch a new product specifically
designed to simplify the use of complex cloud-based call center platforms. This product will be offered as a monthly subscription service,
which is anticipated to provide a steady and predictable stream of revenue/ Sellavir began recognizing revenue in September 2024 in connection with
the call center software. 

Critical
Accounting Policy and Estimates. Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
section discusses our condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including
those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its
estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting
estimates inherent in the preparation of our condensed financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of
certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. In addition, these accounting policies are described
at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to the condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial
statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, together with notes thereto, which are included in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Plan
of Operation 

Our
business strategy is to expand from Geiger counter sales to the development and marketing of CenterEye , our proprietary call center
software. We aim to enhance call center efficiency and customer engagement through innovative AI-driven solutions. While we maintain
our online presence, our primary efforts are directed toward software development, marketing, and establishing partnerships with call
centers and businesses requiring advanced customer service solutions. 

While
we continue to market our website www.quartarad.com we have also started to focus on Sellavir website sellavir.com as part of
our business strategy. 

During
December 2020, Quarta-Rad acquired Sellavir, Inc, a Delaware corporation, under common control, as a wholly owned subsidiary. We acquired
the company in exchange for 333,333 shares of our common stock. The value of the stock on the date of issue was approximately 170,000.
Sellavir was a video analytics company whose platform empowers organizations to decode videos to develop creative marketing strategies
and analysis through advanced and proprietary technologies. Quarta-Rad has acquired the company to leverage Sellavir capabilities to
combine it with its Radex series to offer AI-enhanced radiation detection capabilities and expand its scope outside of radiation measurement.
Sellavir s platform empowers organizations to decode videos to develop creative marketing strategies and analysis and call center
management solutions through advanced and proprietary technologies using artificial intelligence AI ). Sellavir, Inc.,
our wholly-owned subsidiary, is now focused on developing CenterEye , a call center software platform that leverages AI and advanced
analytics to improve call center operations. CenterEye provides real-time insights, performance metrics, and customer engagement tools
that enable organizations to enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction. We are starting to see traction in Japan and are expanding
our marketing efforts to the U.S. and other international markets. 

We
intend to implement the following tasks within the next twelve months: 

Inventory :
We intend to purchase inventory to increase our sales. We believe that these funds will be initially sufficient for us to increase our
inventory from Quarta-Rad, Ltd. The amount needed for inventory purchases is directly related to the demand for sales of our product. 

Software Development: We will continue to invest
in the development and enhancement of CenterEye to meet the evolving needs of the call center industry. This includes adding new
features, improving user experience, and ensuring scalability. 

Marketing :
(Estimated cost 25,000- 75,000). In addition to the website modification costs, we intend to increase our marketing efforts on the Internet
to generate leads and sales. We will also utilize funds to develop marketing brochures and materials to market the products to industry
professionals such as home renovation contractors. 

Partnerships and Client Acquisition: (Estimated
cost 20,000). We aim to establish partnerships with call center operators and technology resellers. Efforts will be made to secure pilot
projects and initial deployments to showcase the effectiveness of CenterEye. 

Our
management does not anticipate the need to hire additional full or part- time employees over the next three (3) months, as the services
provided by our officers and directors and our independent contractor appear sufficient at this time. We believe that our operations
are currently on a small scale that is manageable by these two individuals as well 

 as
our independent contractor. Our management s responsibilities are mainly administrative at this stage. While we believe that the
addition of employees is not required over the next three (3) months, the professionals we plan to utilize will be considered independent
contractors. We do not intend to enter into any employment agreements with any of these professionals. Thus, these persons are not intended
to be employees of our company. 

We
currently do not own any equipment that we would seek to sell in the near future; we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements;
and we have not paid for expenses on behalf of our directors. 

The current majority shareholder is currently funding
operations. During October 2024, the Company is exploring plans to potentially distribute its current operations of both Quarta-Rad and
Sellavir and use the company to support operations in alternate services lines. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

None.

Forward
Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (collectively, the Reform Act ). The Reform
Act provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves
so long as they identify these statements as forward-looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors
that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results. All statements, other than statements of historical fact that we
make in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, are forward-looking. The words anticipates, believes, expects, 
 intends, will continue, estimates, plans, projects, the negative
of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, the absence of these words does
not mean the statement is not forward-looking. 

Forward-looking
statements involve risks, uncertainties or other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from the future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management s
beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Certain risks, uncertainties or other important
factors are detailed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and may be detailed from time to time in other reports we file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, including on Forms 8-K and 10-K. 

We
operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for us to predict
all those risks, nor can we assess the impact of all those risks on our business or the extent to which any factor may cause actual results
to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable.
However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date they are made, and unless required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to
update publicly any of them considering new information or future events. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
condensed financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial
statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the condensed financial statements. The estimates
are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and
results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates
and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023, and Note 1 to the Condensed and Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Accounts
Receivable Accounts Receivable and related party notes receivable amounts from sales to various suppliers and online platforms and loans.
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for probable
uncollectable amounts through a charge to bad debt expense and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the current
status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written
off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. A reserve for sales returns and allowances is considered
immaterial and, as a result, there was no reserve for sales returns and allowances, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information
required by this item. 

23 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
of controls and procedures. 

The
Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Rule
13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company s officer, its president, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on the criteria establish in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the foregoing
evaluation, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 and that they do
not allow for information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules
and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including its Chief Executive and Principal Accounting Financial Officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

The
material weaknesses relate to the following: 

We
 do not have adequate segregation of duties in the handling of our financial reporting. This is caused by a very limited number of
 personnel. 

Our
 accounting staff does not have sufficient technical accounting knowledge relating to accounting for income taxes and complex US GAAP
 matters. 

The
 Company has not performed a risk assessment and mapped our process to control objectives. 

The
 Company has not implemented comprehensive entity-level internal controls. 

The
 Company has not implemented adequate system and manual controls. 

Plan
for Remediation of Material Weaknesses 

We
intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate this deficiency as resources to do so
become available. We intend to consider the results of our remediation efforts and related testing as part of our year-end 2022 assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 

Such
remediation would entail enhancing the training and oversight of the accounting personnel responsible for non-routine transactions involving
complex accounting matters and engaging the services of an independent consultant with sufficient expertise in income tax and complex
U.S. GAAP matters to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements. 

Management
believes that the aforementioned material weaknesses did not impact our financial reporting or result in a material misstatement of our
condensed financial statements. 

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting. 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
