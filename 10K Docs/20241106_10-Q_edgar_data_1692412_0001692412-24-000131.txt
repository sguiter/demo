 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we capitalized million and million of interest expense, respectively, on qualifying assets using the weighted-average interest rate of our debt. We did capitalize any interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Sale of Jewel Palm Beach 
 On August 22, 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our equity interest in the Jewel Palm Beach, which is reported within our Dominican Republic reportable segment, for million in cash consideration.

 (1) Our operating lease income, which is recorded within non-package revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, includes variable lease revenue which is typically calculated as a percentage of our tenant s net sales. 
 
 Note 5. 
 . As a result, our ETR was for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our Dominican Republic taxes are determined based upon Advanced Pricing Agreements APA approved by the Ministry of Finance of the Dominican Republic. The Company s most recent APAs were approved in May 2024 and are effective from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2025. Our estimated annual effective tax rate calculation reflects the terms of the APAs that are expected to apply for the year ending December 31, 2024. 
 We had no uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024. We expect no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months. 
 We regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets by evaluating historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in permitted carry back years, and the availability of tax planning strategies. As of September 30, 2024, a valuation allowance has been maintained as a reserve on a portion of our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realization of our loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets. If our operating results continue to improve and our projections show continued utilization of tax attributes, we may consider that as significant positive evidence and our future reassessment may result in the determination that all or a portion of the valuation allowance is no longer required. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance releases are ultimately contingent upon the level of profitability achieved in future periods.

Financial information for each reportable segment is reviewed by the CODM to assess performance and make decisions regarding the allocation of resources. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have excluded the immaterial amounts of management fees, cost reimbursements, The Playa Collection revenues and other from our segment reporting. 
 The performance of our business is evaluated primarily on adjusted earnings before interest expense, income tax benefit (provision), and depreciation and amortization expense Adjusted EBITDA and the performance of our segments is evaluated on Adjusted EBITDA before corporate expenses, The Playa Collection revenue and management fees Owned Resort EBITDA ). Adjusted EBITDA and Owned Resort EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net (loss) income or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, for the periods presented, before interest expense, income tax benefit (provision), and depreciation and amortization expense, further adjusted to exclude the following items: (a) (gain) loss on sale of assets; (b) loss on extinguishment of debt; (c) other income (expense); (d) repairs from hurricanes and severe weather; (e) share-based compensation; (f) other tax expense; (g) transaction expenses; and (h) severance expense. Adjusted EBITDA includes corporate expenses, which are overhead costs that are essential to support the operation of the Company, including the operations and development of our resorts. 
 There are limitations to using financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA and Owned Resort EBITDA. For example, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or similarly named financial measures that other companies publish to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of the income or loss generated by our business or discretionary cash available for investment in our business and investors should carefully consider our U.S. GAAP results presented in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 (1) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our comparable portfolio excludes the Jewel Palm Beach, which was sold in September 2024, Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos and Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta, which were partially closed for renovations during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and Jewel Punta Cana, which was sold in December 2023. 
 
 Total Revenue and Total Net Revenue 
 
 Our Total Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 29.6 million, or 13.9 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and our Total Net Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 27.9 million, or 13.7 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were heavily impacted by reduced demand in our Jamaica segment due to the Jamaica travel advisory issued by the United States government on January 23, 2024; reduced Occupancy resulting from Hurricane Beryl that mainly affected our Jamaica and Yucat n Peninsula segments; and reduced Occupancy due to renovation work at Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos and Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta. 
 
 The decreases in Total Revenue and Total Net Revenue were due to the following: 
 a decrease in Occupancy of 7.3 percentage points; 
 Excluding Jewel Punta Cana, which was sold in December 2023, and Jewel Palm Beach, which was sold in September 2024, Occupancy decreased 8.1 percentage points compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of lower Occupancy levels at our resorts in our Jamaica, Yucat n Peninsula and Pacific Coast segments from the above-mentioned travel advisory, Hurricane Beryl impacts and renovations, respectively; 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 a decrease in Net Non-package Revenue of 1.2 million, or 4.8 ; 
 Excluding Jewel Punta Cana and Jewel Palm Beach, Net Non-package Revenue decreased 0.2 million, or 0.9 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023; partially offset by 
 an increase in Net Package ADR of 4.3 ; 
 Excluding Jewel Punta Cana and Jewel Palm Beach, Net Package ADR decreased 2.5 . 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 15.4 million, or 38.0 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Excluding Jewel Punta Cana and Jewel Palm Beach, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 18.0 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to: 
 a decline in our Jamaica segment profit due to weaker demand from the travel advisory issued by the United States government; 
 a decline in our Jamaica and Yucat n Peninsula segment profit in July as a result of the impact from Hurricane Beryl; 
 the renovation work at the Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos and Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta; and 
 a decrease in the benefit from business interruption insurance related to the disruption caused by Hurricane Fiona in our Dominican Republic segment in the second half of 2022. 
 Adjusted EBITDA includes a positive impact from business interruption insurance of 0.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023; partially offset by 
 a 3.0 million favorable contribution from the depreciation of the Mexican Peso, inclusive of the impact of our foreign currency forward contracts (refer to discussion of our derivative financial instruments in Note 12). 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 5.6 percentage points, or 28.3 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Excluding Jewel Punta Cana and Jewel Palm Beach, Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased 7.5 percentage points compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA Margin was positively impacted by 160 basis points due to the depreciation of the Mexican Peso and by 40 basis points from business interruption proceeds and recoverable expenses related to Hurricane Fiona. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA Margin was positively impacted by 50 basis points from business interruption proceeds and recoverable expenses related to Hurricane Fiona. 
 Excluding these impacts, Adjusted EBITDA Margin would have been 12.9 , a decrease of 9.1 percentage points compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from the impact to our Jamaica resorts from the travel advisory, the impact from Hurricane Beryl in our Jamaica and Yucat n Peninsula segments, as well as renovation work at Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos and Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta.

 Our direct expenses include resort expenses, such as food and beverage, salaries and wages, utilities and other ongoing operational expenses. Direct operating expenses fluctuate based on various factors, including changes in Occupancy, labor costs, utilities, repair and maintenance costs and licenses and property taxes. Management fees and franchise fees, which are computed as a percentage of revenue, increase or decrease as a result of changes in revenues. 
 Our Net Direct Expenses were 110.5 million, or 62.6 of Total Net Revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 120.3 million, or 58.9 of Total Net Revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net Direct Expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 9.8 million, or 8.1 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the following: 
 the sale of Jewel Punta Cana in December 2023; 
 decreased Occupancy in our Jamaica and Pacific Coast segments which resulted in fewer expenses compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023; and 
 depreciation of the Mexican Peso compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.0 million, or 2.0 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 2.3 million increase in hurricane and severe weather repair expenses due to Hurricane Beryl and Hurricane Helene in September 2024, a 0.8 million increase in professional fees and a 0.7 million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts. We also experienced a 0.6 million increase in share-based compensation expense due to an increase in the number of restricted and performance share awards granted in 2024. These increases were partially offset by a 1.9 million decrease in travel agent and tour operator commission expense due to lower Occupancies as a result of renovation work in the Pacific Coast segment and the sale of Jewel Punta Cana, as well as a 0.7 million decrease in advertising expenses, a 0.5 million decrease in transaction expenses and a 0.3 million decrease in credit card commissions for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Our depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.5 million, or 6.7 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to accelerated depreciation on asset disposals at Hyatt Zilara Cancun during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the sale of Jewel Punta Cana in December 2023, which were partially offset by additional depreciation on asset disposals during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for ongoing renovations of the Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos. 
 Gain on Insurance Proceeds 
 Our gain on insurance proceeds for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.3 million, or 29.2 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of fewer business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2024 related to the temporary closure of two of our resorts in the Dominican Republic due to Hurricane Fiona in the second half of 2022. 
 Interest Expense 
 Our interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 4.6 million, or 17.3 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense was driven primarily by a 4.2 million decrease from the repricing of our Term Loan due 2029, which reduced the interest incurred to SOFR plus a margin of 2.75 from SOFR plus a margin of 4.25 . Our SOFR-based interest rate swaps effective in April 2023 meet the criteria for hedge accounting and therefore, changes in fair value are recognized through other comprehensive income. 
 Cash interest paid was 22.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 2.2 million, or 8.9 decrease as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a 2.2 million decrease from the repricing of our Term Loan due 2029.

 Income Tax Benefit 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax benefit was 5.0 million, compared to a 2.8 million income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 2.2 million was primarily driven by a 0.9 million decreased tax expense related to favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuation at our Mexico entities and a 1.4 million decreased tax expense at our Jamaica entities related to lower pre-tax book income.

 (1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our comparable portfolio excludes the Jewel Palm Beach, which was sold in September 2024, Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos and Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta, which were partially closed for renovations during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and Jewel Punta Cana, which was sold in December 2023. 
 Total Revenue and Total Net Revenue 
 Our Total Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 15.4 million, or 2.1 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and our Total Net Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 13.2 million, or 1.9 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decreases in Total Revenue and Total Net Revenue were primarily due to: 
 reduced demand in our Jamaica segment, which was heavily impacted by the Jamaica travel advisory issued by the United States government on January 23, 2024; 
 reduced Occupancy in July as a result of Hurricane Beryl that mainly affected our Jamaica and Yucat n Peninsula segments; 
 renovation work at Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos and Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta; and 
 a decrease in Net Non-package Revenue of 1.0 million, or 1.1 ; 
 Excluding Jewel Punta Cana and Jewel Palm Beach, Net Non-package Revenue was flat compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023; partially offset by

Table of Contents 

 an increase in Occupancy of 1.8 percentage points as a result of the temporary closure of Jewel Palm Beach for a majority of the first quarter of 2023, as we transitioned management of the resort to us from a third-party. 
 Excluding Jewel Palm Beach and Jewel Punta Cana, Occupancy decreased 3.2 percentage points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of lower Occupancy levels at our resorts in our Jamaica and Pacific Coast segments from the above-mentioned travel advisory, Hurricane Beryl impacts and renovations, respectively; 
 an increase in Net Package ADR of 4.5 ; 
 Excluding Jewel Palm Beach and Jewel Punta Cana, Net Package ADR increased 2.0 , despite a decrease in the Jamaica segment as a result of the travel advisory as well as the impact from ongoing renovations at Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos and Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 8.8 million, or 4.2 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Excluding Jewel Punta Cana and Jewel Palm Beach, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 20.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to: 
 the negative impact to our Jamaica segment from the travel advisory issued by the United States government; 
 a decline in our Jamaica and Yucat n Peninsula segment profit in July as a result of the impact from Hurricane Beryl; 
 the renovation work at the Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos and Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta; 
 a 3.3 million unfavorable impact due to the appreciation of the Mexican Peso, inclusive of the impact of our foreign currency forward contracts (refer to discussion of our derivative financial instruments in Note 12); 
 increased insurance premiums and labor and related expenses compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and 
 a decrease in the benefit from business interruption insurance related to the disruption caused by Hurricane Fiona in our Dominican Republic segment in the second half of 2022. 
 Adjusted EBITDA includes a positive impact of 2.1 million from business interruption insurance proceeds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.7 percentage points, or 2.3 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Excluding Jewel Punta Cana and Jewel Palm Beach, Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased 2.6 percentage points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA Margin was negatively impacted by 50 basis points due to the depreciation of the Mexican Peso and positively impacted by 30 basis points from business interruption proceeds and recoverable expenses related to Hurricane Fiona. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA Margin was positively impacted by 70 basis points from business interruption proceeds and recoverable expenses related to Hurricane Fiona. 
 Excluding these impacts, our Adjusted EBITDA Margin would have been 30.1 , a decrease of 1.7 percentage points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from the impact to our Jamaica resorts from the travel advisory, impact to our Jamaica and Yucatan resorts as a result of Hurricane Beryl, as well as renovation work at Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos and Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta.

 Our direct expenses include resort expenses, such as food and beverage, salaries and wages, utilities and other ongoing operational expenses. Direct operating expenses fluctuate based on various factors, including changes in Occupancy, labor costs, utilities, repair and maintenance costs and licenses and property taxes. Management fees and franchise fees, which are computed as a percentage of revenue, increase or decrease as a result of changes in revenues. 
 Our Net Direct Expenses were 362.7 million, or 52.3 , of Total Net Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 369.6 million, or 52.3 , of Total Net Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net Direct Expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 6.9 million, or 1.9 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the following: 
 decreased expenses from the sale of Jewel Punta Cana in December 2023; and 
 decreased Occupancy in Jamaica and the Pacific Coast segments which resulted in fewer expenses compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 9.3 million, or 6.5 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 3.2 million increase in hurricane and severe weather repair expenses, a 2.8 million increase in insurance expense due to higher insurance premiums for the current year, a 1.9 million increase in corporate and property expenses, a 1.3 million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and a 1.0 million increase in transaction expenses as a result of the repricing of our Term Loan due 2029 in June 2024. We also experienced an increase in share-based compensation expense of 1.7 million due to an increase in the number of restricted and performance share awards granted in 2024 and a 1.4 million increase in professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a 1.6 million decrease in corporate personnel costs, a 1.4 million decrease in travel agent and tour operator commission expense due to lower occupancies in the Jamaica segment as a result of the Jamaica travel advisory issued by the United States government, renovation work in the Pacific Coast segment and the sale of Jewel Punta Cana, a 0.6 million decrease in advertising expenses and a 0.4 million decrease in credit card commissions. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Our depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.3 million, or 3.8 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the sale of Jewel Punta Cana in December 2023 and accelerated asset disposals at Hyatt Zilara Cancun during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which were partially offset by additional depreciation on asset disposals during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for ongoing renovations of the Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos. 
 Gain on Insurance Proceeds 
 Our gain on insurance proceeds for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2.7 million, or 57.3 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of fewer business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2024 related to the temporary closure of two of our resorts in the Dominican Republic due to Hurricane Fiona in the second half of 2022. 
 Interest Expense 
 Our interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 13.9 million, or 16.9 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense was driven primarily by a 6.3 million decrease due to the change in fair value of our prior LIBOR-based interest rate swaps recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and a 6.7 million decrease from the repricing of our Term Loan due 2029 to incur interest based on SOFR plus a margin of 2.75 , a decrease from SOFR plus a margin of 4.25 . Our SOFR-based interest rate swaps effective in April 2023 meet the criteria for hedge accounting and therefore, changes in fair value are recognized through other comprehensive income. 
 Cash interest paid was 66.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 5.1 million, or 7.1 , decrease as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 4.7 million decrease from the repricing of our Term Loan due 2029. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax provision was 7.1 million, compared to a 4.8 million income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 2.3 million was primarily driven by a 12.6 million increased tax expense related to higher pre-tax book income, including increased tax in the Netherlands under the Dutch Minimum Tax Act 2024. The increase was offset by a 9.3 million benefit related to favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations, primarily at our Mexico and Netherlands entities, and a 1.3 million benefit recorded for the finalization of the capital gain tax due on the 2023 Jewel Punta Cana sale compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Key Indicators of Financial and Operating Performance 
 We use a variety of financial and other information to monitor the financial and operating performance of our business. Some of this is financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, while other information, though financial in nature, is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For reconciliations of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, see Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures. Our management also uses other information that is not financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data that are commonly used within the lodging industry to evaluate the financial and operating performance of our portfolio. Our management uses this information to measure the performance of our segments and consolidated portfolio. We use this information for planning and monitoring our business, as well as in determining management and employee compensation. These key indicators include:

 Net Package Revenue, Net Non-package Revenue, Owned Net Revenue, Management Fee Revenue, Cost Reimbursements, Total Net Revenue and Net Direct Expenses 
 Net Package Revenue is derived from the sale of all-inclusive packages, which include room accommodations and premium room upgrades, food and beverage services, and entertainment activities, net of compulsory tips paid to employees. Government mandated compulsory tips in the Dominican Republic are not included in this adjustment, as they are already excluded from revenue. Revenue is recognized, net of discounts and rebates, when the rooms are occupied and/or the relevant services have been rendered. Advance deposits received from guests are deferred and included in trade and other payables until the rooms are occupied and/or the relevant services have been rendered, at which point the revenue is recognized. 
 Net Non-package Revenue includes revenue associated with premium services and amenities that are not included in net package revenue, such as dining experiences, wines and spirits, and spa packages, net of compulsory tips paid to employees. Government mandated compulsory tips in the Dominican Republic are not included in this adjustment, as they are already excluded from revenue. Net Non-package Revenue is recognized after the completion of the sale when the product or service is transferred to the customer. Food and beverage revenue not included in a guest's all-inclusive package is recognized when the goods are consumed. 
 Owned Net Revenue represents Net Package Revenue and Net Non-Package Revenue. Owned Net Revenue represents a key indicator to assess the overall performance of our business and analyze trends, such as consumer demand, brand preference and competition. In analyzing our Owned Net Revenues, our management differentiates between Net Package Revenue and Net Non-package Revenue. Guests at our resorts purchase packages at stated rates, which include room accommodations, food and beverage services and entertainment activities, in contrast to other lodging business models, which typically only include the room accommodations in the stated rate. The amenities at all-inclusive resorts typically include a variety of buffet and la carte restaurants, bars, activities, and shows and entertainment throughout the day. 
 Management Fee Revenue is derived from fees earned for managing resorts owned by third-parties. The fees earned are typically composed of a base fee, which is computed as a percentage of resort revenue, and an incentive fee, which is computed as a

 percentage of resort profitability. Management Fee Revenue was a minor contributor to our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, but we expect Management Fee Revenue to be a more relevant indicator to assess the overall performance of our business in the future to the extent that we are successful in entering into more management contracts. 
 Total Net Revenue represents Net Package Revenue, Net Non-package Revenue, Management Fee Revenue, The Playa Collection revenue and certain Other revenues. Cost reimbursements is excluded from Total Net Revenue as it is not considered a key indicator of financial and operating performance. Cost reimbursements is derived from the reimbursement of certain costs incurred by Playa on behalf of resorts managed by Playa and owned by third parties. This revenue is fully offset by reimbursable costs and has no net impact on operating income or net (loss) income. Contract termination fees, which are recorded as Other Revenues, are also excluded from Total Net Revenue as they are not an indicator of the performance of our ongoing business. 
 Net Direct Expenses represents direct expenses, net of compulsory tips paid to employees. 
 Occupancy 
 Occupancy represents the total number of rooms sold for a period divided by the total number of rooms available during such period. The total number of rooms available excludes any rooms considered Out of Order due to renovation or a temporary problem rendering them inadequate for occupancy for an extended period of time. Occupancy is a useful measure of the utilization of a resort s total available capacity and can be used to gauge demand at a specific resort or group of properties during a given period. Occupancy levels also enable us to optimize Net Package ADR (as defined below) by increasing or decreasing the stated rate for our all-inclusive packages as demand for a resort increases or decreases. 
 Net Package ADR 
 Net Package ADR represents total Net Package Revenue for a period divided by the total number of rooms sold during such period. Net Package ADR trends and patterns provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the guest base of our portfolio or comparable portfolio, as applicable. Net Package ADR is a commonly used performance measure in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry and is commonly used to assess the stated rates that guests are willing to pay through various distribution channels. 
 Net Package RevPAR 
 Net Package RevPAR is the product of Net Package ADR and the average daily occupancy percentage. Net Package RevPAR does not reflect the impact of Net Non-package Revenue. Although Net Package RevPAR does not include this additional revenue, it generally is considered the key performance statistic in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry to identify trend information with respect to net room revenue produced by our portfolio or comparable portfolio, as applicable, and to evaluate operating performance on a consolidated basis or a regional basis, as applicable. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Owned Resort EBITDA, and Owned Resort EBITDA Margin 
 We define EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as net income or loss, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, for the period presented before interest expense, income tax and depreciation and amortization expense. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) include corporate expenses, which are overhead costs that are essential to support the operation of the Company, including the operations and development of our resorts. We define Adjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude the following items: 
 Other miscellaneous non-operating income or expense 
 Pre-opening expense 
 Losses or gains on sales of assets 
 Share-based compensation 
 Other tax expense 
 Transaction expenses 
 Severance expense for employee terminations resulting from non-recurring or unusual events, such as the departure of an executive officer or the disposition of a resort 
 Gains from property damage insurance proceeds (i.e., property damage insurance proceeds in excess of repair and clean up costs incurred) 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 Repairs from hurricanes and severe weather events (i.e., significant repair and clean up costs incurred which are not offset by property damage insurance proceeds) 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt 
 Other items which may include, but are not limited to the following: contract termination fees; gains or losses from legal settlements; and impairment losses. 
 
 We include the non-service cost components of net periodic pension cost or benefit recorded within other income or expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA as they are considered part of our ongoing resort operations. 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Total Net Revenue. 
 Owned Resort EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA before corporate expenses, The Playa Collection revenue and Management Fee Revenue. 
 Owned Resort EBITDA Margin represents Owned Resort EBITDA as a percentage of Owned Net Revenue. 
 Usefulness and Limitation of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures 
 We believe that each of Net Package Revenue, Net Non-package Revenue, Owned Net Revenue, Total Net Revenue, Net Package ADR, Net Package RevPAR, and Net Direct Expenses are all useful to investors as they more accurately reflect our operating results by excluding compulsory tips. These tips have a margin of zero and do not represent our operating results. 
 We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors for two principal reasons. First, we believe Adjusted EBITDA assists investors in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operating performance. For example, changes in foreign exchange rates (which are the principal driver of changes in other income or expense), and expenses related to capital raising, strategic initiatives and other corporate initiatives, such as expansion into new markets (which are the principal drivers of changes in transaction expenses), are not indicative of the operating performance of our resorts. The other adjustments included in our definition of Adjusted EBITDA relate to items that occur infrequently and therefore would obstruct the comparability of our operating results over reporting periods. For example, revenue from insurance policies, other than business interruption insurance policies, is infrequent in nature, and we believe excluding these expense and revenue items permits investors to better evaluate the core operating performance of our resorts over time. We believe Adjusted EBITDA Margin provides our investors a useful measurement of operating profitability for the same reasons we find Adjusted EBITDA useful. 
 The second principal reason that we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors is that it is considered a key performance indicator by our board of directors (our Board and management. In addition, the compensation committee of our Board determines a portion of the annual variable compensation for certain members of our management, including our executive officers, based, in part, on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides investors with information utilized by our Board and management to assess our performance and may (subject to the limitations described below) enable investors to compare the performance of our portfolio to our competitors. 
 We believe that Owned Resort EBITDA and Owned Resort EBITDA Margin are useful to investors as they allow investors to measure resort-level performance and profitability by excluding expenses not directly tied to our resorts, such as corporate expenses, and excluding ancillary revenues not derived from our resorts, such as management fee revenue. We believe Owned Resort EBITDA is also helpful to investors that use it in estimating the value of our resort portfolio. Management uses these measures to monitor property-level performance and profitability. 
 Our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are not substitutes for revenue, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are limitations to the utility of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA. For example, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or similarly named non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that other companies publish to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these limitations, our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a measure of the income or loss generated by our business or discretionary cash available for investment in our business, and investors should carefully consider our U.S. GAAP results presented. 
 For a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Owned Resort EBITDA to net (loss) income as computed under U.S. GAAP, see Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures.

Table of Contents 

 Comparable Non-U.S. GAAP Measures 
 We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Owned Resort EBITDA, Total Net Revenue, Net Package Revenue, Net Non-package Revenue and Net Direct Expenses on a comparable basis is useful to investors because these measures include only the results of resorts owned and in operation for the entirety of the periods presented and thereby eliminate disparities in results due to the acquisition or disposition of resorts or the impact of resort closures or re-openings in connection with redevelopment or renovation projects. As a result, we believe these measures provide more consistent metrics for comparing the performance of our operating resorts. We calculate Comparable Adjusted EBITDA, Comparable Owned Resort EBITDA, Comparable Total Net Revenue, Comparable Net Package Revenue and Comparable Net Non-package Revenue as the total amount of each respective measure less amounts attributable to non-comparable resorts, by which we mean resorts that were not owned or in operation during some or all of the relevant reporting period. 
 Our comparable portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 excludes Jewel Palm Beach, which was sold in September 2024, the Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos and Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta, which were partially closed for renovations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Jewel Punta Cana, which was sold in December 2023.

 Segment Owned Net Revenue . Our Owned Net Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.2 million, or 0.2 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and was driven by: 
 an increase in Net Package ADR of 2.0 ; and 
 an increase in Net Non-package Revenue of 1.1 million, or 14.5 . 
 Net Non-package Revenue per sold room increased 18.8 , primarily driven by higher realized fees related to no-shows, cancellations and loyalty point redemption settlements compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023; partially offset by 
 a decrease in Occupancy of 2.7 percentage points, which was significantly impacted by Hurricane Beryl. 
 Segment Owned Resort EBITDA . Our Owned Resort EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.7 million, or 4.1 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and was driven by: 
 a decrease in Occupancy of 2.7 percentage points, which was largely driven by disruption related to Hurricane Beryl; 
 a headwind from increased labor and related expenses; partially offset by 
 an increase in Net Package ADR compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 in addition to expense efficiency measures put in place to lower direct expenses; and 
 a favorable contribution of 2.2 million due to the depreciation of the Mexican Peso, net of the impact of our foreign currency forward contracts (refer to discussion of our derivative financial instruments in Note 12). 
 Our Owned Resort EBITDA Margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 24.7 , a decrease of 1.2 percentage points compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Owned Resort EBITDA Margin was positively impacted by 330 basis points due to the depreciation of the Mexican Peso and negatively impacted by 210 basis points from increases in labor and related expenses compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact from the depreciation of the Mexican Peso, Owned Resort EBITDA Margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 would have been 21.4 , a decrease of 4.5 percentage points compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 an increase in Net Package ADR in addition to expense efficiency measures put in place to lower direct expenses; partially offset by 
 an unfavorable impact of 2.0 million due to the appreciation of the Mexican Peso, net of the impact of our foreign currency forward contracts (refer to discussion of our derivative financial instruments in Note 12); 
 a headwind from increased labor and related expenses, which were partially due to union-negotiated and government-mandated wage benefit increases; and 
 an increase in insurance premiums. 
 Our Owned Resort EBITDA Margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 34.4 , a decrease of 0.2 percentage points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Owned Resort EBITDA Margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negatively impacted by 80 basis points due to the appreciation of the Mexican Peso and 100 basis points from increases in labor and related expenses compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact from the appreciation of the Mexican Peso, Owned Resort EBITDA Margin would have been 35.2 , an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Segment Owned Net Revenue . Our Owned Net Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 23.2 million, or 13.6 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by the travel advisory issued for Jamaica by the United States government and Hurricane Beryl which negatively impacted this segment during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted in: 
 a decrease in Occupancy of 7.9 percentage points; 
 a decrease in Net Package ADR of 3.8 ; and

 Inflation 
 We have experienced an elevated level of inflationary pressure on our direct resort expenses since the beginning of 2022. Inflation effects were experienced mostly through higher labor costs, food and beverage prices, and utility costs. Although we have experienced some improvement, we expect that inflationary pressures may remain elevated through 2024, but could continue for longer. While we, like most operators of lodging properties, have the ability to adjust room rates to reflect the effects of inflation, competitive pricing pressures may limit our ability to raise room rates to fully offset inflationary cost increases.

Table of Contents 

 Seasonality 
 The seasonality of the lodging industry and the location of our resorts in Mexico, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic have historically resulted in the greatest demand for our resorts occurring between mid-December and April of each year, yielding higher occupancy levels and package rates during this period. This seasonality in demand has resulted in predictable fluctuations in revenue, results of operations, and liquidity, which are consistently higher during the first quarter of each year than in successive quarters. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 72.7 million. We believe that our sources of cash, which consist of available cash and cash from operations, together with the available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility and our access to the capital markets, will be adequate to meet our cash requirements, including our contractual obligations, over the next twelve months and beyond. 
 Sources of Cash 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 211.1 million of available cash, as compared to 272.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Our primary short-term cash needs are paying operating expenses, maintaining our resorts, and servicing our outstanding indebtedness. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through our existing cash balances, net cash provided by operations, equity issuances or short-term borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Further, we had no restricted cash balance as of September 30, 2024. As of October 31, 2024, we had approximately 192.6 million of available cash and also had 225.0 million available on our Revolving Credit Facility, which does not mature until January 2028. 
 We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements generally through the sources of cash available for short-term needs, net cash provided by operations, as well as equity or debt issuances or proceeds from the potential disposal of assets. 
 Cash Requirements 
 Our expected material cash requirements for the remainder of 2024 and thereafter consist of (i) contractually obligated expenditures, including payments of principal and interest; (ii) other essential expenditures, including operating expenses and maintenance of our resorts; and (iii) opportunistic expenditures, including possible property developments, expansions, renovations, repositioning and rebranding projects, potential acquisitions, the repayment of indebtedness and discretionary repurchases of our securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes to our Contractual Obligations table in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, other than an off-balance sheet arrangement entered into for the future purchase of liquified natural gas at one of our resorts (see Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) and a fifteen-year finance lease obligation to produce electricity and hot water (see Note 11 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). As of September 30, 2024, we had 21.3 million of scheduled contractual obligations remaining in 2024 which we expect to pay with available cash. 
 We are continuing to monitor our liquidity and we may pursue additional sources of liquidity as needed. The availability of additional liquidity options will depend on the economic and financial environment, our credit, our historical and projected financial and operating performance and continued compliance with financial covenants. If operating conditions decline or are materially adversely impacted, we may not be able to maintain our current liquidity position or access additional sources of liquidity at acceptable terms or at all. 
 Financing Strategy 
 We intend to use other financing sources that may be available to us from time to time, including financing from banks, institutional investors or other lenders, such as bridge loans, letters of credit, joint ventures and other arrangements. Future financings may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our assets. In addition, we may issue publicly or privately placed debt or equity securities. When possible and desirable, we will seek to replace short-term financing with long-term financing. We may use the proceeds from any financings to refinance existing indebtedness, to finance resort projects or acquisitions or for general working capital or other purposes. 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 Our indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse or cross-collateralized and may be fixed rate or variable rate. If the indebtedness is non-recourse, the obligation to repay such indebtedness will generally be limited to the particular resort or resorts pledged to secure such indebtedness. In addition, we may invest in resorts subject to existing loans secured by mortgages or similar liens on the resorts or may refinance resorts acquired on a leveraged basis. 
 Recent Transactions Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following table summarizes our net cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and accompanying notes thereto in thousands) : 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 72,660 75,165 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 110 (12,840) Net cash used in financing activities (134,153) (161,862) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents (61,383) (99,537) 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Our net cash from operating activities is generated primarily from operating income of our resorts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash provided by operating activities was 72.7 million compared to 75.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Our net cash provided by investing activities was 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.8 million used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Purchases of property and equipment of 64.5 million, consisting of maintenance capital expenditures as well as renovation costs of the Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta and Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos; and 
 Net proceeds from the sale of assets, primarily consisting of the Jewel Palm Beach, of 65.3 million. 
 Activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Purchases of property and equipment of 30.5 million, consisting of maintenance capital expenditures as well as renovation costs of the Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta and Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos; and 
 Property damage insurance proceeds related to the impacts of Hurricane Fiona in the Dominican Republic of 17.8 million. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We maintain each of our properties in good repair and condition and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, franchise and license agreements and management agreements. Capital expenditures made to extend the service life or increase the capacity of our assets, including expenditures for the replacement, improvement or expansion of existing capital assets (i.e., maintenance capital expenditures), differ from ongoing repair and maintenance expense items, which do not in our judgment extend the service life or increase the capacity of assets and are charged to expense as incurred. From time to time, certain of our resorts may be undergoing renovations as a result of our decision to upgrade portions of the resorts, such as guestrooms, public space, meeting space, gyms, spas and/or restaurants, in order to better compete with other resorts in our markets. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Our net cash used in financing activities was 134.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 161.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. A number of our significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments with respect to our such policies are reasonable based upon information presently available. However, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions, which could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 
 
 We have discussed those estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application in our Consolidated Financial Statements included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or the methodologies or assumptions we apply under them except for those disclosed in Note 2 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
 Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade and other receivables, accounts receivable from related parties, certain prepayments and other assets, trade and other payables, payables to related parties, derivative financial instruments, other liabilities, including our pension obligation, and debt (excluding the financing lease obligations).

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 In the normal course of operations, we are exposed to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk which may impact future income and cash flows. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The risk from market interest rate fluctuations mainly affects long-term debt bearing interest at a variable interest rate. We currently use two interest rate swaps (see Note 12 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) to manage our exposure to this risk. As of September 30, 2024, 49 of our outstanding indebtedness bore interest at floating rates, as our Term Loan due 2029 incurs interest based on SOFR plus a margin of 2.75 . 
 If market rates of interest on our floating rate debt were to increase by 1.0 , the increase in interest expense on our floating rate debt would decrease our future earnings and cash flows by approximately 5.3 million annually, assuming the balance outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility remained at 0 million. 
 If market rates of interest on our floating rate debt were to decrease by 1.0 , the decrease in interest expense on our floating rate debt would increase our future earnings and cash flows by approximately 5.3 million annually, assuming the balance outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility remained at 0 million. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations because all of our resort investments are based in locations where the local currency is not the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 less than 1 of our revenues were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, our revenues reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations are affected by movements in exchange rates. 
 Approximately 72.3 of our resort-level operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were denominated in the local currencies in the countries in which we operate. During 2024, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge 50 of our estimated operating expenses that are denominated in Mexican Pesos. However, our operating expenses reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations continue to be affected by movements in exchange rates, including the Mexican Peso, Dominican Peso and the Jamaican Dollar. 
 The effect of an immediate 5 adverse change in foreign exchange rates on Mexican Peso-denominated expenses at September 30, 2024 would have impacted our Owned Resort EBITDA by approximately 4.1 million on a year-to-date basis, inclusive of the impact from our foreign currency forward contracts. 
 The effect of an immediate 5 adverse change in foreign exchange rates on Dominican Peso-denominated expenses at September 30, 2024 would have impacted our Owned Resort EBITDA by approximately 4.6 million on a year-to-date basis. 
 The effect of an immediate 5 adverse change in foreign exchange rates on Jamaican Dollar-denominated expenses at September 30, 2024 would have impacted our Owned Resort EBITDA by approximately 4.1 million on a year-to-date basis.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
