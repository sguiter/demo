million and million , respectively. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million . Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were million . During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had negative cash flows from operations of million and million, respectively. The aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including, without limitation, progress with developing, manufacturing and marketing our technologies; the time and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights; our ability to establish collaborative arrangements; completion of any acquisitions or other strategic transactions; marketing activities and competing technological and market developments, including regulatory changes and overall economic conditions in our target markets. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability requires us to successfully market and secure purchase orders for our products and services from existing as well as new customers. We also will be required to efficiently manufacture and deliver on those purchase orders. These activities, including our planned research and development efforts, may require significant uses of working capital. There can be no assurance that we will generate revenue and cash as expected in our current business plan. The Company recognizes it will need to raise additional capital to continue research and development and to fund its planned operations, clinical trials and, if regulatory approval is obtained, commercialization of future products. We may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, when needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the interim condensed financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q, as well as our audited financial statements and related notes as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors or in other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q, as well as those identified in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, each of which Risk Factors are incorporated in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q by reference. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. See Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Business Overview 
 
 Tivic Health is a health tech company focused on bioelectronic medicine. Bioelectronic medicine is a branch of the global neuromodulation market that treats disease and conditions by modulating the electrical signals carried along various nerve pathways. The field grew out of the neuromodulation industry which relied, historically, on implantable devices (e.g., pacemakers, spinal implants, deep brain stimulators). IDTechEx has identified several fast-growing areas in the bioelectronic medicine field, including peripheral nerve stimulation, which it has indicated is forecasted to grow at a 35 CAGR from 2019 through 2029. Tivic currently has two non-invasive bioelectronic platforms designed to deliver therapeutic benefits via manipulation of such signals without the use of traditional implanted technology. 
 
 Commercial Platforms 
 
 Tivic has developed two complementary platforms. Tivic s first commercial platform is a handheld design that interfaces non-invasively with the trigeminal, sympathetic, and other facial and cranial nerve structures. This platform is the basis for Tivic s existing product, currently marketed with FDA approval as ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief for the treatment of sinus pain and congestion. 
 
 The second platform is a clincal-stage platform directed to vagus nerve stimulation. . 
 
 First Commercial Product 
 
 Tivic Health currently markets one commercial product under the brand name ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief. ClearUP is built on our patented, handheld neuromodulation design and was developed by Tivic Health for the treatment of sinus and allergy-related conditions. It uses ultra-low current electrical waves to relieve sinus pain and congestion symptoms that are prevalent in nasal allergies, sinus infections, chronic sinusitus, cold and flu and other disease conditions. ClearUP had U.S. FDA approval for the treatment of sinus pain and congestion, and is the first FDA-approved bioelectronic treatment of the foregoing indications. Additionally, ClearUP has E.U. CE Mark approval for the treatment of sinus pain, pressure and congestion. 
 
 The FDA initially provided clearance to our ClearUP product under a 510(k) as an allergy treatment in January 2019. The FDA granted ClearUP a subsequent De Novo clearance in March 2021, which expanded ClearUP s label, enabling marketing of ClearUP for allergies, sinusitis, cold, flu, and any inflammatory condition involving congestion. 
 
 A 2023 study with over 2,000 representative consumers conducted by Intellego Insights (commissioned by Tivic Health) identified that approximately 85 million U.S. adults experience inflammation-related symptoms related to allergies, congestion, head pain, and sinus issues. Of the consumers that participated in the study, 58 of sufferers try to avoid medication, if at all possible. 
 
 Customers can purchase ClearUP products directly from Tivic via our own website and through major online stores, including Amazon, Walmart, BestBuy, FSAStore and HSA Store. The Company has also entered distribution agreements with McKesson, Cardinal Health and Cencora (previously Amerisource Bergen).

cervical vagus nerve stimulation ncVNS approach, which induces responses in the autonomic, cardiac, and central nervous systems and can be expected to have clinical utility in several major disease areas. 
 
 Compared to baseline measurement, our ncVNS intervention resulted in a 97 increase in the root mean square of successive differences RMSSD measure of heart rate variability, which is a widely accepted proxy for vagus nerve activity. 

Measurements of brain activity using EEG demonstrated that our ncVNS intervention increased frontal theta power by 24 and reduced gamma power in several brain regions, including a 66 reduction in frontal gamma power. These changes in brain activity are consistent with reduced arousal and anxiety. 

During ncVNS stimulation, subjects had sustained pupil constriction, a 9.5 reduction in pupil diameter, an outcome associated with activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. 

The magnitude of our ncVNS data imply potential for greater clinical effects and enhanced reproducibilit than demontrated by previous studies of non-invasive VNS devices. These results in healthy subjects suggest our ncVNS approach may have clinical utility in several patient populations including those with post-traumatic stress disorder, cardiac disease, inflammatory conditions, and ischemic stroke, among others. 
 
 On May 17, 2024, we entered into a Collaboration and Research Support Agreement with The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research to further optimize responses in Autonomic Nervous System ANS function in response to Tivic's ncVNS. Total length of the project is expected to be one year. The study, being run by The Feinstein Institute of Bioelectronic Medicine, will identify device parameters, including frequency and duration of treatment, that optimally influence ANS function. 
 
 On September 18, 2024, we announced approval for the contracted clinical work by Northwell Health's Institutional Review Board, required before enrollment of subjects. 
 
 On October 29, 2024, we announced enrollment of the first subject in this optimization study for our patent pending, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation device. The results will be used to inform clinical indication priority and commercial development. Enrollment is expected to be complete by early December. 
 
 VNS Commercial Strategy 
 On September 17, 2024, we announced our partnership with Fletcher Spaght, Inc ("FSI"), a leading healthcare growth strategy firm, to accelerate development of our commercial strategy for ncVNS. The firm has begun a comprehensive market assessment of our ncVNS technology drawing from clinical outcomes from our Phase 1 trial. FSI and Tivic initially identified approximately 30 potential medical use cases for our ncVNS technology in neurologic, cardiac, psychiatric and autonomic nervous system diseases. FSI is now working closely with our scientific and clinical leadership to identify the strongest market entry points by interviewing clinical key opinion leaders and payers The work with FSI will help us sharpen our go-to-market strategy, clinical study plans, reimbursement pathway, and product development pipeline for our vagus nerve stimulation program. 
 
 Postoperative Pain Clinical Research 
 
 On August 13, 2024, Tivic received the final report from an investigator-led double-blind study funded by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai on the use of microcurrent as an alternative for the treatment of pain following functional endoscopic sinus surgery, rhinoplasty and other forms of sino-nasal surgeries. No statistically significant differences were identified between users of the active microcurrent device and sham device. Given the relatively small market size and lack of definitive indicators of clinical utility, the Company currently has no plans to fund additional research in this area, prioritizing, instead, its work on vagus nerve stimulation. 
 
 Lease Termination 
 
 On May 21, 2024, we entered into a Sublease Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement with Czarnowski Display Service, Inc. CDS ), pursuant to which we terminated that certain Sublease Agreement, by and between the Company and CDS, dated as of November 17, 2021 (the Sublease ), effective as of May 31, 2024 (the Termination Date ). Prior to the Termination Date, we leased approximately 9,091 square feet of office space located at 25821 Industrial Boulevard, Suite 100, Hayward, California (the Premises under the Sublease, which served as our principal place of business.

Table of Contents 

In exchange for the early termination of the Sublease pursuant to the Termination Agreement, we made a one-time termination payment to CDS in the amount of 44,480.44. Additionally, in connection with the termination, we agreed to pay (i) all commissions owned to any broker in connection with the sublease of the Premises by CDS to the new sublessee, and (ii) any fees or expenses charged by the owner of the Premises in connection with its review of the new sublease agreement with the new sublessee. 
 
 We expect that the termination of the Sublease will result in a reduction of approximately 200 thousand in lease expense over the next year and a half. 
 
 New Principal Place of Business 
 
 On May 30, 2024, we entered into a Co-Working Space Agreement, pursuant to which we rent office space located at 47685 Lakeview Blvd., Fremont, California, which will serve as our principal place of business, for a total 1 thousand a month. The agreement has an initial term of six months, commencing June 1, 2024, after which it will automatically renew on a month to month basis until terminated. 
 
 ALOM Agreement Termination 
 
 Effective August 1, 2024, we terminated the Fulfillment Services Agreement with ALOM Technologies Corporation ALOM in furtherance of our efforts to continue to reduce both direct and indirect costs associated with product manufacturing and distribution of our ClearUp device. ALOM provided assembly, procurement, storage, returns, and fulfillment services to the our end customers and retailers within the United States. We are now utilizing third-party logistics and storage services from alternate suppliers without material minimums and have established in-house assembly and testing capabilities. We completed the transition with no disruptions to service and foresees current capacity will be sufficient to meet demand for the foreseeable future. 
 September 2024 Equity Distribution Agreement

 Nasdaq Compliance 
 
 On June 28, 2024, we received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying us that, because the closing bid price for our common stock was below 1.00 per share for 33 consecutive business days, we are not currently in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). The notification had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and, therefore, our listing remains fully effective. 
 
 23 

Table of Contents 

In accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a period of 180 calendar days from June 27, 2024, or until December 26, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If at any time before December 26, 2024, the closing bid price of our common stock closes at or above 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and the matter would be resolved. If we do not regain compliance during the compliance period ending on December 26, 2024, then Nasdaq may grant us a second 180 calendar day grace period to regain compliance, provided we (i) meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly-held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, other than the minimum closing bid price requirement, and (ii) we notify Nasdaq of our intent to cure the deficiency. 
 
 We intend to continue actively monitoring the closing bid price for our common stock between now and December 26, 2024, and will consider available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If we do not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period, including any extensions that may be granted by Nasdaq, Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting. We would then be entitled to appeal that determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. There can be no assurance that we will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement during the 180 day compliance period, secure a second period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance, or maintain compliance with the other Nasdaq listing requirements. 
 
 Amended and Restated 2021 Equity Incentive Plan

Revenue 
 Revenue is currently generated through the sale of our ClearUP device and ancillary products, including accessories and accelerated shipping charges, and is net of return reserves. Sales are currently made directly to consumers online through our own website, and Amazon. In addition, the ClearUP device is also sold via our distribution partners Cardinal Health and McKesson to major retailers and specialty retailers, such as FSA Store, Walmart, BestBuy, and Target. Noninvasive bioelectronic medicine is an emerging market space that provides consumers with non-drug treatments for various diseases and ClearUP is the first FDA-approved bioelectronic treatment for sinus pain and congestion. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue decreased overall by 156 thousand, or 56 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 55 decrease in the number of units sold. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue decreased overall by 219 thousand, or 27 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 36 decrease in unit sales, offset by a 13 increase in the per unit average sales price. 
 We expect some continued variability in sales due to reduction in marketing spend. 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales consists primarily of the materials and services to manufacture our products, the internal personnel costs to oversee manufacturing and supply chain functions, and the shipment of goods to customers. Cost of sales is expected to vary on an absolute basis as sales volume increases or decreases. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales decreased by 92 thousand, or 53 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by the decrease in unit sales. We incurred 21 thousand of disposal costs associated with our move to a new logistics provider in August 2024. We expect reduced product support and fulfillment charges in the future with the new provider. Excluding the 21 thousand disposal charge in the third quarter of 2024, variable cost was 45 thousand, or 60.68 per unit, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 120 thousand, or 73.57 per unit, for the same period in 2023. Fixed costs were 16 thousand, or 21.41 per unit, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 54 thousand, or 33.05 per unit, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in the fixed cost was primarily due to lower product support costs.

Table of Contents 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales decreased by 178 thousand, or 34 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by the decrease in sales volume, offset by 21 thousand of disposal costs and 20 thousand of inventory obsolescence write-offs. Variable cost, excluding the disposal costs and inventory write-offs, was 229 thousand, or 68.86 per unit, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 364 thousand, or 70.09 per unit, for the same period in 2023. Fixed costs were 88 thousand, or 26.47 per unit, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 173 thousand, or 33.37 per unit, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in the fixed cost was primarily due to lower product support costs. 
 Gross Margin 
 Gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by, and is likely to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to, a variety of factors, including sales volumes, product and channel mix, pricing strategies, costs of finished goods, reserves for obsolescence, disposal costs of returned and/or obsolete inventory, product return rates, new product launches and potential new manufacturing partners and suppliers. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to conduct research, including the discovery, development and validation of product candidates. Research and development expenses include personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, third-party contractor services, including development and testing of prototype devices, and maintenance of limited in-house research facilities. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect research and development expenses to increase with the discovery and validation of new product candidates. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses increased by 85 thousand compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses decreased by 315 thousand compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in the three month period was due to increased costs associated with research related to vagus nerve stimulation. The decrease for the nine month period was due to reduced headcount and certain expenses incurred in 2023 which did not recur in 2024. The emphasis of research and development activities in both 2023 and 2024 are primarily related to studies at The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research on vagus nerve stimulation and intellectual property protection. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs and expenses for advertising and other marketing services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. We may see sales and marketing expenses increase modestly if we continue to expand our markets and distribution channels. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses decreased by 246 thousand compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses decreased by 444 thousand compared to the same period in 2023. The decreases were due to reduced headcount and consulting fees as well as reductions in agency, website and other costs. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses include D O insurance, personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services and other expenses. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Outside professional services consist of legal, finance, accounting and audit services, and other consulting fees. We expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased by 232 thousand compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses decreased by 1.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease for the three month period was primarily due to reduced headcount and elimination of the lease expenses due to the change in our headquarters in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease for the nine month period was attributable to reduced headcount, reduced lease expenses, lower consulting and professional fee expenses, as well as other general administrative expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Since our formation in September 2016, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, to regulatory clearance and to market development and testing for our first product, released in September 2019 in the United States. We are not profitable and have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations in each year since our inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 2.2 million, working capital of 2.6 million and an accumulated deficit of 42.1 million. We have financed our operations to date primarily through issuances of SAFE instruments, convertible notes and convertible preferred stock and the proceeds from registered offerings of our securities. In 2021, we completed our IPO, generating net proceeds to the Company of approximately 14.9 million, and we borrowed 2.6 million by issuing convertible notes payable, the outstanding balance of all of which converted into shares of our common stock in connection with our IPO. On February 13, 2023, we completed the sale of 200,000 shares of our common stock in a firm commitment, fully underwritten registered public offering, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately 3.6 million. From July 11, 2023 to August 9, 2023, we sold an aggregate of 1,169,230 shares of our common stock to certain investors in a series of registered public offerings, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to the Company of approximately 4.3 million. Additionally, in May 2024, we sold an aggregate of 4,710,000 shares of our common stock, together with Series A warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,710,000 shares of common stock and Series B warrants to purchase an aggregate of 7,065,000 shares of common stock, to certain investors in a registered public offering, resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately 3.3 million. On September 13, 2024, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the ATM Agreement ), with Maxim Group LLC Maxim ), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through or to Maxim, as sales agent or principal, up to 10,000,000 in shares of our common stock, subject to our then current baby shelf limitation under General Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3. To date, however, we have only used the ATM Agreement for 18 thousand in gross proceeds. 
 Although we have taken measures to decrease our operating expenses, we expect that our operating expenses may increase significantly as we discover, acquire, validate and develop additional product candidates; seek regulatory approval and, if approved, proceed to commercialization of new products; obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel when needed. Furthermore, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs associated with operating as a public company. Management expects to incur substantial additional operating losses for the foreseeable future to expand our markets, complete development or acquisition of new product lines, obtain regulatory approvals, launch and commercialize our products and continue research and development programs. Based on the Company s current cash levels and burn rate, amongst other things, the Company believes its cash and financial resources may be insufficient to meet the Company s anticipated needs for the twelve months following the date of issuance of the financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Report, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. 
 
 Plan of Operation and Future Funding Requirements 
 We have used our capital resources primarily, to date, to fund marketing and advertising for ClearUP, development of both our trigeminal and our vagus nerve platforms and product candidates, evaluating and diligencing potential licensing and acquisition candidates, and the establishment of public company operating infrastructure and general operations. Although we have taken measures to decrease our operating expenses, we expect that our operating expenses will increase as we advance our vagus nerve platform, as well as discover, acquire, validate or develop additional product candidates; seek regulatory approval and, if approved, proceed to commercialization of new products; obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; hire additional personnel when needed; and maintain compliance with material government (in addition to environmental) regulations. We plan to increase our research and development investments in our vagus nerve platform and clinical applications thereof in 2024. 
 
 Furthermore, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. At this time, due to the inherently unpredictable nature of research and new product adoption as well as other macroeconomic factors, we cannot reasonably estimate the costs we will incur and the timelines that will be required to complete development, obtain marketing approval and commercialize future product candidates, if at all. For the same reasons, we are also unable to predict how quickly we will generate significant revenue from ClearUP product sales or whether, or when, if ever, we may achieve profitability from the sales of one or more products. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success, and costs can differ materially from expectations. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be best developed and/or monetized through future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. 
 
 In addition to the foregoing, we may, from time to time, consider opportunities for strategic acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we believe will align with our growth plan, complement our product offerings and be in the best interest of the Company and our 
 27 

Table of Contents 

shareholders. If an acquisition or other strategic transaction is identified and pursued, a substantial portion of our cash reserves may be required to complete such acquisition or other strategic transaction. If we identify an attractive acquisition that would require more cash to complete than we are willing or able to use from our cash reserves, we will consider financing options to complete the acquisition, including through equity and/or debt financings. 
 
 We have generated operating losses in each period since inception. We have incurred an accumulated deficit of 42.1 million through September 30, 2024. We expect to incur additional losses in the future as we expand both our research and development activities. Based on our current cash levels and burn rate, amongst other things, we believe our cash and financial resources may be insufficient to meet our anticipated needs for the next twelve months. As a result, we expect that we will need to raise additional capital to continue operating our business and fund our planned operations, including research and development, clinical trials and, if regulatory approval is obtained, commercialization of future product candidates. 
 We currently generate sales revenue direct-to-consumer though our own websites, Amazon.com and Walmart.com. We also sell to major and specialty U.S. online retailers such as BestBuy and FSAStore and through distributors including McKesson s affiliate Simply Medical, Cardinal Health and Cencora (formerly known as Amerisource Bergen). Our ability to grow sales revenue will depend on successfully executing a comprehensive marketing campaign to drive additional sales through existing and new channels. Long-term growth will be commensurate with our ability to successfully identify, develop, and secure regulatory approval of one or more additional product candidates beyond ClearUP. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through private or public equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate, foundation or government funding sources, or through other sources of financing. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, when needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations, and we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of our products and/or future product candidates. 
 
 The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on: 
 our ability to raise additional capital if and when necessary and on terms favorable to the Company; 

the timing and progress of sales initiatives driving top-line revenue; 

the availability of electronic parts and other components for our products, as well as our ability to source such parts and components at favorable prices; 

the timing and adoption rate of ClearUP line extensions at lower cost of goods; 

the payment terms and timing of commercial contracts entered into for manufacturing and sales of our products to and through online third-party retailers; 

the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities; 

the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; 

the timing and amount of milestone payments we may receive under any future collaboration agreements; 

whether we close potential future strategic acquisition opportunities, and if we do, our ability to successfully integrate acquired assets and/or businesses with our own; 

our ability to source new business opportunities through licenses and research and development programs and to establish new collaboration arrangements; 

the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims; 

the cost and timing of additional regulatory approvals beyond those currently held by us; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel, including personnel to support finance, sales, marketing, operations and development of our product candidates and satisfy our obligations as a public company; and 

our efforts to maintain compliance with material government (including environmental) regulations. 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, we expect to fund our operations and capital funding needs through equity and/or debt financings. We may also consider entering into collaboration arrangements or selectively partnering with third parties for clinical development and commercialization. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to 
 28 

Table of Contents 

our stockholders. The incurrence of additional debt would result in debt service obligations, and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations or our ability to incur additional indebtedness or pay dividends, among other items. If we raise additional funds through governmental funding, collaborations, strategic partnerships and alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, and/or suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.4 million, which consisted primarily of a net loss of 4.2 million, decreased by non-cash charges of 266 thousand and increased by a net decrease of 448 thousand in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation of 166 thousand and amortization of right-of-use assets of 76 thousand. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 648 thousand, a decrease in accounts receivable of 160 thousand, a decrease in prepaid and other current assets of 93 thousand, and a decrease of 96 thousand in lease liabilities. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 6.7 million, which consisted primarily of a net loss of 6.0 million, decreased by non-cash charges of 348 thousand and a net decrease of 1.1 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation of 213 thousand and amortization of right-of-use assets of 129 thousand. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 869 thousand and a decrease of 115 thousand in lease liabilities. 
 Investing Activities 
 There was no cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was related to the purchases of property and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 Our financing activities provided 3.2 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of 4,710,000 shares of our common stock and Common Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 11,775,000 shares of common stock in May 2024, net of offering discounts and other costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our financing activities provided 8.5 million of cash, which consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of 1,369,230 shares of our common stock, net of offering discounts and other costs. 
 Known Trends or Uncertainties 
 As discussed elsewhere in this Report, the world has continued to be been affected by the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine as well as Israel and Hamas, economic uncertainty in human capital management HCM and certain other macroeconomic factors. Inflation has risen, Federal Reserve interest rates have increased over the last year, and the general consensus among economists continues to suggest that we should expect a higher recession risk to continue for the near term. Climate change continues to be an intense topic of public discussion and is adding additional challenges and financial burden due to impending preparations and changes in the customer mindset. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes, including changes 
 29 

Table of Contents 

and uncertainty as a result of the upcoming U.S. presidential election, could increase market volatility. These factors, amongst other things, could result in further economic uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets in the near term, and could negatively affect our operations. Effects of the pandemic and recent economic volatility have negatively impacted our business in various ways over the last three years, including as a result of global supply chain constraints at least partially attributable to the pandemic. We will continue to monitor material impacts on our HCM strategies, including potential of employee attrition, amongst other things. 
 
 Global supply chain shortages (especially when coupled with the increase in inflation and other economic factors) could result in an increase in the cost of the components used in our products, which could result in a decrease of our gross margins or in us having to increase the price at which we sell our products until supply chain constraints are resolved. Additionally, in the event that the price of our components increases significantly or we are unable to source sufficient components and materials from our current suppliers, or to develop relationships with additional suppliers, to manufacture enough of our products to satisfy demand, we may have to cease or slow down production and our business operations and financial condition may be materially harmed and we may need to alter our plan of operation. 
 
 The United States has implemented tariffs on certain imported goods, including on certain items imported from China. In addition, China has imposed tariffs on a wide range of American products and placed restrictions on the export of certain items, including gallium and germanium, in retaliation for these American tariffs. As a result, there is a concern that the imposition of additional tariffs by the United States could result in the adoption of additional tariffs or export restrictions by China and/or other countries. Any resulting trade war could negatively impact our business. The imposition of tariffs on items imported by us from China or other countries could increase our costs and could result in lowering our gross margin on products sold. 
 
 Additionally, U.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflicts is highly unpredictable, the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as further supply chain interruptions. Additionally, the recent military conflict in Ukraine has led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union and other countries against Russia. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets, potentially making it more difficult for us to obtain additional funds. 
 
 Although our business has not been materially impacted by the ongoing military conflict between Russian and Ukraine or the conflict between Israel and Hamas to date, it is impossible to predict the extent to which our operations, or those of our suppliers and manufacturers, will be impacted in the short and long term, or the ways in which the conflict may impact our business. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial. We are continuing to monitor the situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and globally to assess potential impacts on our business. 
 
 As a result of these global issues and other macroeconomic factors, it has been difficult to accurately forecast our revenues or financial results, especially given the near and long term impact of the pandemic, geopolitical issues, inflation, the Federal Reserve maintaining high interest rates, the potential for a recession and recent uncertainties stemming from the upcoming election. In addition, while the potential impact and duration of these issues on the economy and our business may be difficult to assess or predict, these world events have resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, and may reduce our ability to access additional capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future. Our results of operations could be materially below our forecasts as well, which could adversely affect our results of operations, disappoint analysts and investors, or cause our stock price to decline. Furthermore, a decrease in orders in a given period could negatively affect our revenues in future periods. 
 
 These global issues and events may also have the effect of heightening many risks associated with our customers and supply chain. We may take further actions that alter our operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities from time to time, or which we determine are in our best interests. In addition, we may decide to postpone or abandon planned investments in our business in response to changes in our business, which may impact our ability to attract and retain customers and our rate of innovation, either of which could harm our business. 
 
 Inflation 
 Inflation has increased recently and future rates are unknown. Inflationary factors, such as increases in the cost of our products (and components thereof), interest rates, overhead costs and transportation costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, we may experience some effect in the near future (especially if inflation rates continue to rise) due to supply chain constraints, consequences associated with the 
 30 

Table of Contents 

ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, employee availability and wage increases, trade tariffs imposed on certain products from China and increased component and services pricing. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Office Lease 
 The Company previously entered into a noncancelable operating lease for approximately 9,091 square feet of office space in Hayward, California as its headquarters. The lease was set to expire in October 2025 and there was no option to renew for an additional term. The Company was obligated to pay, on a pro-rata basis, real estate taxes and operating costs related to the premises. The lease was terminated on May 31, 2024 and the Company has no further obligations with regard to the lease. 
 
 On May 30, 2024, we entered into a Co-Working Space Agreement, pursuant to which we rent office space located at 47685 Lakeview Blvd., Fremont, California for a total 1 thousand a month. The agreement has an initial term of six months, commencing June 1, 2024, after which it will automatically renew on a month to month basis until terminated. 
 Lease costs recorded during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 84 thousand and 151 thousand, respectively. 
 Purchase Commitments 
 
 The Company has entered into multiple contracts related to the development of Tivic's ncVNS technology, including a collaboration and research support agreement and a research study to substantiate clinical indications that have potential to be addressed by Tivic's patent-pending ncVNS system. The contracts require milestone payments to be made upon the successful completion of certain deliverables. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has remaining commitments to pay a total of 231 thousand for milestones not yet achieved. The remaining payments are expected to be incurred over the next six months. 
 
 We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with our contract manufacturer and other vendors to assist in the manufacturing of our products and performance of our research and development activities and other services for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination for convenience after expiration of an advance notice period ranging from 0 to 60 days, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments. Except as set discussed elsewhere in this Report, there have been no material changes to our previously disclosed business strategy with respect to our contractual obligations as disclosed under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contractual Obligations in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the condensed financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to sales return reserves, stock-based compensation, and going concern. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors, including the macro-economic factors, that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The methods, estimates, and judgments used by us in applying these critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are included in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 25, 2024. 
 Information regarding our significant accounting policies and estimates can also be found in Note 2 to our condensed financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and our interim Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Evaluation Date ), have concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer, where appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our interim Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings, litigation or claims, nor are aware of any pending, threatened, or unasserted claims, which, if determined adversely to us, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may from time to time, be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Please carefully consider the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report ). The risks described in our Annual Report, as well as other risks and uncertainties, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the risks discussed in such filings, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial, could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material updates or changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report; provided, however, additional risks not currently known or currently material to us may also harm our business. 
 If our stock price continues to remain below 1.00, our common stock may be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which would materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and have an adverse effect on our market price. 
 On June 28, 2024, we received a notification from Nasdaq that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of our common stock has been below 1.00 per share for 33 consecutive business days. The notification had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock, which will continue to trade at this time on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol TIVC. 
 In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a period of 180 calendar days from June 27, 2024, or until December 26, 2024, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed 1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days during this 180 calendar day period. In the event we do not regain compliance by December 26, 2024, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period if we meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares 1 million) and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price, and we provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If we do not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period(s), Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. Additionally, if the closing bid price of our common stock is 0.10 or less for ten consecutive trading days, Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. In the event we receive a delisting notice, we may appeal such delisting determination to a hearings panel. 
 We are currently evaluating our alternatives to resolve the listing deficiency. To the extent that we are unable to resolve the listing deficiency, there is a risk that our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which would adversely impact liquidity of our common stock, potentially result in even lower bid prices for our common stock, and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing through the sale of our common stock. 
 If we elect to implement a reverse stock split to regain compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements, such reverse stock split could have a materially adverse effect on our business. 
 In the event that we are unable to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) through other methods, we may be required to implement a reverse stock split in order to do so. There are a number of risks associated with implementing a reverse stock split, including, without limitation: 
 The market price per share of our common stock post-reverse stock split may not remain in excess of the 1.00 minimum bid price per share, as required by Nasdaq, or we may fail to meet the other requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq, including the minimum value of listed securities, resulting in the delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market;

the reverse stock split may not result in a price per share that will successfully attract certain types of investors, and such resulting share price may not satisfy the investing guidelines of institutional investors or investment funds; 

the trading liquidity of the shares of our common stock may not improve, or may decline, as a result of the reverse stock split and there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split, if completed, would result in the intended benefits; 

a reverse stock split could be viewed negatively by the market and other factors, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

There can be no assurances that implementation of a reverse stock split would allow us to prevent the delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, and it could have a materially adverse effect on our business.
