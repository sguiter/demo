 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL RISKS 
 
 The following is a summary of the risk factors associated with investing in our securities. You should read this summary together with a more detailed description of these risks in the "Risk Factors" section of this report and in other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC. 
 
 the general political, economic, competitive, and other conditions in the United States and in any foreign jurisdictions in which we invest and their impact on our loan portfolio, financial condition and business operations; 
 
 fluctuations in interest rates and credit spreads could reduce our ability to generate income on our loans and other investments, which could lead to a significant decrease in our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our investments and could materially impair our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders; 
 
 adverse developments in the real estate and real estate capital markets could negatively impact our performance; 
 adverse legislative or regulatory developments, including with respect to tax laws, securities laws, and the laws governing financial and lending institutions; 
 
 adverse developments in the availability of attractive loan and other investment opportunities whether they are due to competition, regulation or otherwise, could adversely affect our results of operations;

global economic trends and economic conditions, including heightened inflation, slower growth or recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, higher interest rates, labor shortages, currency fluctuations and challenges in global supply chains; 
 
 events giving rise to increases in our current expected credit loss reserve; 
 
 reduced demand for office, multifamily or retail space, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or hybrid work schedules which allow work from remote locations other than the employer's office premises; 
 
 our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity position, and business could be adversely affected if we experience (i) difficulty accessing financing or raising capital, including due to a significant dislocation in or shut-down of the capital markets, (ii) a reduction in the yield on our investments, (iii) an increase in the cost of our financing, (iv) an inability to borrow incremental amounts or an obligation to repay amounts under our financing arrangements, or (v) defaults by borrowers in paying debt service on outstanding loans; 
 
 deterioration in the performance of the properties securing our investments that may cause deterioration in the performance of our investments, adversely impact certain of our financing arrangements and our liquidity, risks in collection of contractual interest payments, and potentially, principal losses to us; 
 
 difficulty or delays in redeploying the proceeds from repayments of our existing investments may cause our financial performance to decline; 
 
 acts of God such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters, pandemics such as COVID-19, acts of war and/or terrorism and other events that may cause unanticipated and uninsured performance declines and/or losses to us or the owners and operators of the real estate securing our investments; 
 
 increased competition from entities engaged in mortgage lending and/or investing in our target assets; 
 
 conflicts with KKR and its affiliates, including our Manager, could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders;

 Debt obligations included in the tables above are obligations of KREF s consolidated subsidiaries, which own the related collateral, and such collateral is generally not available to other creditors of KREF. 
 
 While KREF is generally not required to post margin under certain repurchase agreement terms for changes in general capital market conditions such as changes in credit spreads or interest rates, KREF may be required to post margin for changes in conditions to specific loans that serve as collateral for those repurchase agreements. Such changes may include declines in the appraised value of property that secures a loan or a negative change in the borrower's ability or willingness to repay a loan. To the extent that KREF is required to post margin, KREF's liquidity could be significantly impacted. Both KREF and its lenders work cooperatively to monitor the performance of the properties and operations related to KREF's loan investments to mitigate investment-specific credit risks. Additionally, KREF incorporates terms in the loans it originates to further mitigate risks related to loan nonperformance.

 times the total -month trailing average annual management fee and incentive compensation earned by the Manager through the most recently completed calendar quarter. 
 
 Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Manager, as agent to KREF and under the supervision of KREF's board of directors, manages the investments, subject to investment guidelines approved by KREF's board of directors; financing activities; and day-to-day business and affairs of KREF and its subsidiaries. 
 
 For its services to KREF, the Manager is entitled to a quarterly management fee equal to the greater of or of weighted average adjusted equity and quarterly incentive compensation equal to of the excess of (a) the trailing -month distributable earnings (before incentive compensation payable to the Manager) over (b) of the trailing -month weighted average adjusted equity Hurdle Rate ), less incentive compensation KREF already paid to the Manager with respect to the first calendar quarters of such trailing -month period. The quarterly incentive compensation is calculated and paid in arrears with a one-quarter lag. 
 
 Adjusted equity generally represents the proceeds received by KREF and its subsidiaries from equity issuances, without duplication and net of offering costs, and distributable earnings, reduced by distributions, equity repurchases, and incentive compensation paid. Distributable earnings generally represent the net income, or loss, attributable to equity interests in KREF and its subsidiaries, without duplication, as well as realized losses not otherwise included in such net income, or loss, excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, incentive compensation, depreciation and amortization and unrealized gains or losses, from and after the effective date to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. KREF's board of directors, after majority approval by independent directors, may also exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain material non-cash income or expense items from distributable earnings. For purposes of calculating incentive compensation, adjusted equity excludes: (i) the effects of equity issued by KREF and its subsidiaries that provides for fixed distributions or other debt characteristics and (ii) unrealized provision for (reversal of) credit losses. 
 
 KREF is also required to reimburse the Manager or its affiliates for documented costs and expenses incurred by it and its affiliates on behalf of KREF, except those specifically required to be borne by the Manager under the Management Agreement. The Manager is responsible for, and KREF does not reimburse the Manager or its affiliates for, the expenses related to investment personnel of the Manager and its affiliates who provide services to KREF. However, KREF does reimburse the Manager for KREF's allocable share of compensation paid to certain of the Manager s non-investment personnel, based on the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to KREF's affairs. 
 
 Incentive Plan KREF's compensation committee or board of directors may administer the Incentive Plan, which provides for awards of stock options; stock appreciation rights; restricted stock; RSUs; limited partnership interests of KKR Real Estate Finance Holdings L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), a wholly owned subsidiary of KREF, that are directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable or redeemable for shares of KREF's common stock pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership OP Interests awards payable by (i) delivery of KREF's common stock or other equity interests, or (ii) reference to the value of KREF's common stock or other equity interests, including OP Interests; cash-based awards; or performance compensation awards. 
 
 No more than of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis, assuming the exercise of all outstanding stock options granted under the Incentive Plan and the conversion of all warrants and convertible securities into shares of common stock, or a total of shares of common stock, will be available for awards under the Incentive Plan. In addition, (i) the maximum number of shares of common stock subject to awards granted during a single fiscal year to any non-employee director (as defined in the Incentive Plan), taken together with any cash fees paid to such non-employee director during the fiscal year, may not exceed million and (ii) the maximum amount that can be paid to any participant for a single fiscal year during a performance period (or with respect to each single fiscal year if a performance period extends beyond a single fiscal year) pursuant to a performance compensation award denominated in cash may not exceed million.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The historical consolidated financial data below reflects the historical results and financial position of KREF. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in the Form 10-K and under "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 

Overview 
 
 Our Company and Our Investment Strategy 
 
 We are a real estate finance company that focuses primarily on originating and acquiring transitional senior loans secured by commercial real estate ("CRE") assets. We are a Maryland corporation that was formed and commenced operations on October 2, 2014, and we have elected to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our investment strategy is to originate or acquire transitional senior loans collateralized by institutional-quality CRE assets that are owned and operated by experienced and well-capitalized sponsors and located in top markets with strong underlying fundamentals. The assets in which we invest include senior loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") and other real estate-related securities. Our investment allocation strategy is influenced by prevailing market conditions at the time we invest, including interest rate, economic and credit market conditions. In addition, we may invest in assets other than our target assets in the future, in each case subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act. Our investment objective is capital preservation and generating attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends. 
 
 Our Manager 
 
 We are externally managed by our Manager, KKR Real Estate Finance Manager LLC, an indirect subsidiary of KKR Co. Inc. KKR is a leading global investment firm with an over 45-year history of leadership, innovation, and investment excellence. KKR manages multiple alternative asset classes, including private equity, real estate, energy, infrastructure and credit, with strategic manager partnerships that manage hedge funds. Our Manager manages our investments and our day-to-day business and affairs in conformity with our investment guidelines and other policies that are approved and monitored by our board of directors. Our Manager is responsible for, among other matters, (i) the selection, origination or purchase and sale of our portfolio investments, (ii) our financing activities and (iii) providing us with investment advisory services. Our Manager is also responsible for our day-to-day operations and performs (or causes to be performed) such services and activities relating to our investments and business and affairs as may be appropriate. Our investment decisions are approved by an investment committee of our Manager that is comprised of senior investment professionals of KKR, including senior investment professionals of KKR's global real estate group. For a summary of certain terms of the management agreement, see Note 14 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Macroeconomic Environment 
 
 The last several quarters have been marked by significant volatility in global markets, driven by inflation, elevated interest rates, slowing economic growth, trade tensions, geopolitical conditions, and political and regulatory uncertainty. These conditions have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, the U.S. and global economies, the real estate industry and our borrowers, and the performance of the properties securing our loans. Collectively, these market dynamics pose challenges to commercial real estate values and transaction activity, which have resulted in lower demand for office space and elevated levels of vacancy and default rates. 
 
 Although the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 50 basis points on September 18, 2024, interest rates remain elevated and the timing, direction and extent of any future interest rate changes remain uncertain. Although higher interest rates will generally correlate to increases in our net income, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our existing borrowers and the cost of financing their properties and lead to nonperformance. Higher interest rates may also adversely impact real estate asset values and increase our interest expense, which expense may not be fully offset by any resulting increase in interest income.

 Key Financial Measures and Indicators 
 
 As a real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared, Distributable Earnings and book value per share. 
 
 Earnings (Loss) Per Share and Dividends Declared 
 
 The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share and dividends declared per share (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data): 
 Three Months Ended, September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (12,991) 20,223 Weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, basic and diluted 69,434,938 69,423,244 Net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted (0.19) 0.29 Dividends declared per share 0.25 0.25 
 
 Distributable Earnings 
 
 Distributable Earnings, a measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, is a key indicator of our ability to generate sufficient income to pay our quarterly dividends and in determining the amount of such dividends, which is the primary focus of yield/income investors who comprise a significant portion of our investor base. Accordingly, we believe providing Distributable Earnings on a supplemental basis to our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP is helpful to our stockholders in assessing the overall performance of our business. 
 
 We define Distributable Earnings as net income (loss) attributable to our stockholders or, without duplication, owners of our subsidiaries, computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized losses not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss) and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, and (iv) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain material non-cash income or expense items agreed upon after discussions between our Manager and our board of directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors. The exclusion of depreciation and amortization from the calculation of Distributable Earnings only applies to debt investments related to real estate to the extent we foreclose upon the property or properties underlying such debt investments. 
 
 While Distributable Earnings excludes the impact of our unrealized current provision for (reversal of) credit losses, any loan losses are charged off and realized through Distributable Earnings when deemed non-recoverable. Non-recoverability is generally determined (i) upon the resolution of a loan (i.e. when the loan is repaid, fully or partially, or, in the case of foreclosure, when the underlying asset is sold), or (ii) if, in our determination, it is nearly certain that all amounts due under a loan will not be collected. 
 
 Distributable Earnings should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP net income or taxable income. We caution readers that our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and as a result, our reported Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other REITs. 
 
 We also use Distributable Earnings (before incentive compensation payable to our Manager) to determine the management and incentive compensation we pay our Manager. For its services to KREF, our Manager is entitled to a quarterly management fee equal to the greater of 62,500 or 0.375 of weighted average adjusted equity and quarterly incentive compensation equal to 20.0 of the excess of (a) the trailing 12-month Distributable Earnings (before incentive compensation payable to our Manager) over (b) 7.0 of the trailing 12-month weighted average adjusted equity Hurdle Rate ), less incentive compensation KREF already paid to the Manager with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such trailing 12-month period. For purposes of calculating incentive compensation under our Management Agreement, adjusted equity excludes: (i) the effects of equity issued that provides for fixed distributions or other debt characteristics and (ii) the unrealized provision for (reversal of) credit losses. The quarterly incentive compensation is calculated and paid in arrears with a three-month lag.

 (C) Includes a 615 thousand loss on the sale of certain real estate owned assets during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Book Value per Share 
 
 We believe that book value per share is helpful to stockholders in evaluating the growth of our company as we have scaled our equity capital base and continue to invest in our target assets. The following table calculates our book value per share (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data):

 Our Portfolio 
 
 We have established a 6,710.7 million portfolio of diversified investments, consisting primarily of senior commercial real estate loans as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we collected 100.0 of interest payments due on our loan portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the average risk rating of our loan portfolio was 3.2, weighted by total loan exposure. As of September 30, 2024, the average loan commitment in our portfolio was 120.2 million and multifamily and industrial loans comprised 60 of our loan portfolio. 
 
 In addition, we owned Real Estate Assets with an investment amount of 335.6 million, comprised of the acquired properties and capitalized redevelopment costs, as of September 30, 2024. These properties are reflected on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 We have executed on our primary investment strategy of originating floating-rate transitional senior loans and, as we continue to scale our loan portfolio, we expect that our originations will be heavily weighted toward floating-rate loans. As of September 30, 2024, 99 of our loans by total loan exposure earned a floating rate of interest. We expect the majority of our future investment activity to focus on originating floating-rate senior loans that we finance with our repurchase and other financing facilities, with a secondary focus on originating floating-rate loans for which we syndicate a senior position and retain a subordinated interest for our portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, all of our investments were located in the United States. 
 
 The following charts illustrate the diversification and composition of our loan portfolio, based on type of investment, interest rate, underlying property type, geographic location, vintage and LTV as of September 30, 2024: 

The charts above are based on total loan exposure of our commercial real estate loans.

 Portfolio Surveillance and Credit Quality 
 
 Our Manager actively manages our portfolio and assesses the risk of any deterioration in credit quality by quarterly evaluating the performance of the underlying property, the valuation of comparable assets as well as the financial wherewithal of the associated borrower. Our loan documents generally give us the right to receive regular property, borrower and guarantor financial statements; approve annual budgets and tenant leases; and enforce loan covenants and remedies. In addition, our Manager evaluates the macroeconomic environment, prevailing real estate fundamentals and micro-market dynamics where the underlying property is located. Through site inspections, local market experts and various data sources, as part of its risk assessment, our Manager monitors criteria such as new supply and tenant demand, market occupancy and rental rate trends, and capitalization rates and valuation trends. 
 
 We maintain a robust asset management relationship with our borrowers and have utilized these relationships to maximize the performance of our portfolio, including during periods of volatility. 
 
 We believe our loan sponsors are generally committed to supporting assets collateralizing our loans through additional equity investments, and that we will benefit from our long-standing core business model of originating senior loans collateralized by large assets in major markets with experienced, well-capitalized institutional sponsors. While we believe the principal amounts of our loans are generally adequately protected by underlying collateral value, there is a risk that we will not realize the entire principal value of certain investments. 
 
 In addition to ongoing asset management, our Manager performs a quarterly review of our portfolio whereby each loan is assigned a risk rating of 1 through 5, from lowest risk to highest risk. Our Manager is responsible for reviewing, assigning and updating the risk ratings for each loan at least once per quarter. The risk ratings are based on many factors, including, but not limited to, underlying real estate performance, values of comparable properties, durability and quality of property cash flows, sponsor experience and financial wherewithal, and the existence of a risk-mitigating loan structure. Additional key considerations include debt service coverage ratios, real estate and credit market dynamics, and risk of default or principal loss. In performing this review and assigning a risk rating with respect to each loan, our Manager assesses these various factors holistically and considers these factors on a case-by-case basis, determining whether to give additional weight to any of these factors based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each loan. Based on a five-point scale, our loans are rated "1" through "5," from less risk to greater risk, which ratings are defined as follows: 1 (Very Low Risk); 2 (Low Risk); 3 (Medium Risk); 4 (High Risk/Potential for Loss); and 5 (Impaired/Loss Likely). 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the average risk rating of our portfolio was 3.2 , weig hted by total loan exposure, consistent with that as of December 31, 2023.

 (A) Maximum facility size represents the largest amount of borrowings available under a given facility once sufficient collateral assets have been approved by the lender and pledged by us. 
 (B) Available borrowings represents the undrawn amount we could draw under the terms of each credit facility, based on collateral already approved and pledged. 
 
 Master Repurchase Agreements 
 
 We utilize master repurchase facilities to finance the origination of senior loans. After a mortgage asset is identified by us, the lender agrees to advance a certain percentage of the principal of the mortgage to us in exchange for a secured interest in the mortgage. We have not received any margin calls on any of our master repurchase facilities to date. 
 
 Repurchase agreements effectively allow us to borrow against loans and participations that we own in an amount generally equal to (i) the market value of such loans and/or participations multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. Under these agreements, we sell our loans and participations to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and participations from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus an interest factor. The transaction is treated as a secured loan from the financial institution for GAAP purposes. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and participations and pay interest to the lender under the master repurchase agreement. At any point in time, the amounts and the cost of our repurchase borrowings will be based upon the assets being financed higher risk assets will result in lower advance rates (i.e., levels of leverage) at higher borrowing costs and vice versa. In addition, these facilities include various financial covenants and limited recourse guarantees, including those described below. 
 
 Each of our existing master repurchase facilities includes "credit mark-to-market" features. "Credit mark-to-market" provisions in repurchase facilities are designed to keep the lenders' credit exposure generally constant as a percentage of the underlying collateral value of the assets pledged as security to them. If the credit underlying collateral value decreases, the gross amount of leverage available to us will be reduced as our assets are marked-to-market, which would reduce our liquidity. The lender under the applicable repurchase facility sets the valuation and any revaluation of the collateral assets in its sole, good faith discretion. As a contractual matter, the lender has the right to reset the value of the assets at any time based on then-current market conditions, but the market convention is to reassess valuations on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis using the financial information delivered pursuant to the facility documentation regarding the real property, borrower and guarantor under such underlying loans. Generally, if the lender determines (subject to certain conditions) that the market value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount, the lender may require us to provide additional collateral or lead to margin calls that may require us to repay all or a portion of the funds advanced. We closely monitor our liquidity and intend to maintain sufficient liquidity on our balance sheet in order to meet any margin calls in the event of any significant decreases in asset values. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average haircut under our repurchase agreement s w as 32.5 (or 30.1 , if we had borrowed the maximum amount approved by its repurchase agreement counterparties as of such dates). In addition, our existing master repurchase facilities are not entirely term-matched financings and may mature

 before our CRE debt investments that represent underlying collateral to those financings. As we negotiate renewals and extensions of these liabilities, we may experience lower advance rates and higher pricing under the renewed or extended agreements.

 Non-Consolidated Senior Interests 
 
 In certain instances, we finance our loans through the non-recourse sale of a senior loan interest that is not included in our condensed consolidated financial statements. These non-consolidated senior interests provide structural leverage on a non-mark-to-market, match-term basis for our net investments, which are typically reflected in the form of mezzanine loans or other subordinate interests on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and in our condensed consolidated statement of income. We had no outstanding financing through non-consolidated senior interests as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Secured Term Loan 
 
 In 2020, we entered into a 300.0 million secured term loan at a price of 97.5 . The secured term loan is partially amortizing, with an amount equal to 1.0 per annum of the principal balance due in quarterly installments. In 2021, we completed a 52.2 million add-on, which was issued at par, for an aggregate principal amount of 350.0 million. The secured term loan bears coupon interest at Adjusted Term SOFR, as defined in the secured term loan agreements, plus a 3.50 margin, and is subject to a 0.50 SOFR floor. 
 
 The secured term loan matures on September 1, 2027 and contains restrictions relating to liens, asset sales, indebtedness, investments and transactions with affiliates. Our secured term loan is secured by corporate level guarantees and does not include asset-based collateral. Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our secured term loan. 
 
 Covenants Each of our repurchase facilities, term lending agreements, warehouse facility and our Revolver contain customary terms and conditions, including, but not limited to, negative covenants relating to restrictions on our operations with respect to our status as a REIT, and financial covenants, such as: 
 
 a trailing four quarter interest income to interest expense ratio covenant (1.3 to 1.0 beginning September 30, 2024 through June 30, 2025, then 1.4 to 1.0 thereafter); 
 a consolidated tangible net worth covenant (75.0 of the aggregate net cash proceeds of any equity issuances made and any capital contributions received by us and KKR Real Estate Finance Holdings L.P. (our "Operating Partnership") or up to approximately 1,307.7 million, depending on the agreement; 
 a total indebtedness covenant (83.3 of our Total Assets, as defined in the applicable financing agreements); and 
 a cash liquidity covenant (the greater of (i) 10.0 million or (ii) 5.0 of KREF's recourse indebtedness; from September 30, 2024 and through June 30, 2025 the Revolver has a minimum cash liquidity covenant of 75.0 million)

 Real Estate Assets 
 
 Portland Retail / Redevelopment In 2015, we originated a 177.0 million senior loan secured by a retail property in Portland, OR. In December 2021, we took title to the retail property and accounted for the property on a consolidated basis. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition under ASC 805. Accordingly, we recorded the property on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as real estate owned ("REO") with a carrying value of 78.6 million, which included the estimated fair value of the property. We contributed a portion of the REO asset with a carrying value of 68.9 million to a joint venture (the "REO JV") with a third party local developer JV Partner ), whereby we had a 90 interest and the JV Partner had a 10 interest. The JV Partner's interest in the property was presented within "Noncontrolling interests in equity of consolidated joint ventures" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, we have a priority of distributions up to 78.4 million before the JV Partner can participate in the economics of the REO JV. 
 
 Philadelphia Office / Garage In 2019, we originated a 182.6 million senior loan secured by an office portfolio in Philadelphia, PA. In December 2023, we received a 6.0 million partial repayment and then took title to the office property through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure ("DIL"). The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition under ASC 805. Accordingly, we recorded the portfolio and its net assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with an estimated fair value of 86.4 million, which included 1.3 million of cash received and 76.5 million, 24.6 million and 15.9 million allocated to REO held for sale, lease intangible and other assets, and leasing and other liabilities, respectively. As a result, we recognized a 58.7 million loan write-off for the difference between the amortized cost of the foreclosed loan and the fair value of the REO s net assets. 
 
 In June 2024, we sold a portion of the portfolio for a gross sales price of 41.0 million and recognized a realized loss of 0.6 million after buyer credits and closing costs. Concurrently, we provided financing to the buyer through a senior loan with an initial principal balance of 30.1 million 83.7 million total commitment). The senior loan earns a coupon rate of S+4.3 and has a maximum maturity of June 2029, assuming all extension options are exercised. The senior loan is presented within Commercial real estate loans, held-for-investment, net on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the remaining REO assets and liabilities met the criteria to be classified as held for sale under ASC 360. As such, depreciation and amortization on the REO and related lease intangibles were suspended. 
 
 Mountain View Office In 2021, we co-originated with a KKR affiliate a 362.8 million senior loan secured by an office property in Mountain View, CA. Our interest was 68.9 of the loan or 250.0 million. In June 2024, we and the KKR affiliate took title to the office property through a DIL and we accounted for the property on a consolidated basis. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition under ASC 805. Accordingly, we recorded the property and its net assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with an estimated fair value of 174.7 million, which included 175.0 million of REO held for investment and 0.3) million of net working capital. As a result, we recognized a 79.9 million loan write-off for the difference between our interest in the amortized cost of the foreclosed loan and our share of the fair value of the REO s net assets and closing costs. The KKR affiliate's interest in the property was 31.1 , or 54.3 million, upon DIL and was presented within "Noncontrolling interests in equity of consolidated joint ventures" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Seattle Life Science (Equity Method Investment) In 2021, we co-originated with a KKR affiliate a 188.0 million senior loan secured by a life science property in Seattle, WA. Our interest was 74.6 of the loan or 140.3 million. In June 2024, we received a 14.3 million partial repayment, then along with the KKR affiliate took title to the life science property through a DIL under a Tenant-in-Common ("TIC") agreement. Under the TIC agreement, we and the KKR affiliate held an economic interest of 74.6 and 25.4 , respectively, and shared decision-making. Under ASC 970-810, we accounted for the TIC agreement as an undivided interest in the property and recorded an 82.0 million "Equity method investment, real estate asset" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result, we recognized a 18.6 million loan write-off for the difference between the amortized cost of the foreclosed loan and our share of the fair value of the property s net assets and closing costs.

 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income decreased by 3.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the preceding three-month period. This decrease was primarily due to a reduced loan portfolio size as a result of repayments and the impact of two additional loans placed on nonaccrual status in September 2024. We recorded 3.9 million of deferred loan fees and origination discounts accreted into interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.8 million during the preceding period. In addition, we recorded 3.8 million of deferred financing costs amortization into interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.3 million for the preceding period. 
 
 Other Income 
 
 Total other income increased by 2.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the preceding period. This increase was primarily due to a 2.8 million increase in revenue from REO operations, resulting from 5.3 million of insurance proceeds received in July 2024, partially offset by a decrease in rental income after a property sale in June 2024. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Total operating expenses increased by 32.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the preceding period. This increase was primarily due to a 33.7 million change in the provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to additional reserves for risk-rated 5 loans, primarily in the life science sector.

 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income decreased by 18.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a reduced loan portfolio size as a result of repayments or other resolutions and the impact of certain loans on nonaccrual status accounted for under the cost recovery method. We recorded 13.5 million of deferred loan fees and origination discounts accreted into interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 17.8 million during the prior year period. In addition, we recorded 13.1 million of deferred financing costs amortization into interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 20.4 million during the prior year period. 
 
 Other Income 
 
 Total other income increased by 7.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to a 13.3 million increase in revenue from REO operations, partially offset by a decrease in interest income earned on our cash balance. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Total operating expenses decreased by 43.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to a 49.6 million change in the provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to additional reserves for risk-rated 5 loans, primarily in the office and life science sectors.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 We have capitalized our business to date primarily through the issuance and sale of our common stock and preferred stock, borrowings from three master repurchase agreements, and borrowings from our Non-Mark-to-Market Financing Sources, which were comprised of collateralized loan obligations, term lending agreements, term loan facility, secured term loan, asset specific financing, warehouse facility, and corporate revolver. Our Non-Mark-to-Market Financing Sources, which accounted for 79 of our total financing as of September 30, 2024, are not subject to credit or capital markets mark-to-market provisions. The remaining 21 of our total financing, which are comprised of three master repurchase agreements, are only subject to credit marks. We have not received any margin calls on our master repurchase agreements to date. 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include 108.8 million of cash on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, 10.0 million of loan principal payment held by a servicer, 475.0 million of available capacity on our corporate Revolver, 43.8 million of available borrowings under our financing arrangements based on existing collateral, and cash flows from operations. In addition, we had 336.9 million of total unencumbered assets, including 208.3 million of real estate owned assets, 93.2 million of unencumbered senior loans and 35.4 million of investments in CMBS B-Pieces, that can be financed, as of September 30, 2024. Our corporate Revolver and secured term loan are secured by corporate level guarantees and include net equity interests in the investment portfolio. We may seek additional sources of liquidity from syndicated financing, other borrowings (including borrowings not related to a specific investment) and future offerings of equity and debt securities. 
 
 Our primary liquidity needs include our ongoing commitments to repay the principal and interest on our borrowings and to pay other financing costs, financing our assets, meeting future funding obligations, making distributions to our stockholders, funding our operations that includes making payments to our Manager in accordance with the management agreement, and other general business needs. We believe that our cash position and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet anticipated requirements for financing, operating and other expenditures in both the short- and long-term, based on current conditions. 
 
 As described in Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have off-balance sheet arrangements related to VIEs that we account for using the equity method of accounting and in which we hold an economic interest or have a capital commitment. Our maximum risk of loss associated with our interests in these VIEs is limited to the carrying value of our investment in the entities and any unfunded capital commitments. As of September 30, 2024, we held 35.4 million of interests in such entities, which does not include a remaining commitment of 4.3 million to our CMBS B-Piece investment that we are required to fund if called. 
 
 The banking sector and financial market recently witnessed significant volatility resulting from multiple bank failures. While we maintained no accounts at these failed banks, substantially all of our cash currently on deposit with other major financial institutions exceeds insured limits. We limit exposure relating to our short-term financial instruments by diversifying these financial instruments among various counterparties. Generally, deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore we believe bear minimal credit risk. 
 
 To facilitate future offerings of equity, debt and other securities, we have in place an effective shelf registration statement (the Shelf with the SEC. The amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this Shelf was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit on the amount of securities we may issue. The securities covered by this Shelf include: (i) common stock, (ii) preferred stock, (iii) depository shares, (iv) debt securities, (v) warrants, (vi) subscription rights, (vii) purchase contracts, and (viii) units. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering material, at the time of any offering. 
 
 We have also entered into an equity distribution agreement with certain sales agents, pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of 100.0 million of our common stock, pursuant to a continuous offering program (the ATM ), under the Shelf. Sales of our common stock made pursuant to the ATM may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares of common stock under the ATM. As of September 30, 2024, 93.2 million remained available for issuance under the ATM.

 (A) The allocation of repurchase facilities and term lending agreements is based on the earlier of (i) the maximum maturity of the underlying loans pledged as collateral or (ii) the maximum maturity of the respective financing agreements. Amounts borrowed are subject to a maximum 25.0 recourse limit. 
 (B) Any amounts borrowed are full recourse to certain subsidiaries of KREF. Amounts are estimated based on the amount outstanding under the Revolver and the interest rate in effect as of September 30, 2024. This is only an estimate as actual amounts borrowed, the timing of repayments and interest rates may vary over time. The Revolver matures in March 2027. 
 (C) The amounts are estimated by assuming the amounts outstanding under these facilities and the interest rates in effect as of September 30, 2024 will remain constant into the future. The actual amounts borrowed and rates may vary over time. 
 (D) We have future funding obligations related to our investments in senior loans. These future funding obligations primarily relate to construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Generally, funding obligations are subject to certain conditions that must be met, such as customary construction draw certifications, minimum debt service coverage ratios, minimal debt yield tests, or executions of new leases before advances are made to the borrower. As such, the allocation of our future funding obligations is based on the earlier of the expected funding or commitment expiration date. 
 
 We are required to pay our Manager a base management fee, an incentive fee and reimbursements for certain expenses pursuant to our management agreement. The table above does not include the amounts payable to our Manager under our management agreement as they are not fixed and determinable. See Note 14 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for additional terms and details of the fees payable under our management agreement. 
 
 As a REIT, we generally must distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to stockholders in the form of dividends to comply with the REIT provisions of the Code. Our taxable income does not necessarily equal our net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP, or our Distributable Earnings as described above under "Key Financial Measures and Indicators Distributable Earnings". 
 
 Subsequent Events 
 
 Our subsequent events are detailed in Note 17 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires our Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. There have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 We originate and purchase CRE debt and related instruments generally to be held as long-term investments at amortized cost. We recognize and measure the allowance for credit losses under the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") model, which requires us to estimate expected credit losses, not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. The measurement of expected credit losses under CECL is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, and off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for credit losses is deducted from the respective loans amortized cost basis on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The allowance for credit losses attributed to unfunded loan commitments is included in Other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Commencing in the second quarter of 2024, we have estimated CECL reserves using the Weighted-Average Remaining Maturity, or WARM method, which has been identified as a loss-rate method for estimating CECL reserves by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ). In estimating a CECL reserve using the WARM method, we reference historical loan loss data across a comparable data set and apply such loss rate to each loan over its expected remaining term, taking into consideration expected economic conditions over the relevant timeframe. In certain instances, we might use other acceptable alternative approaches in the future depending on, among other factors, the type of loan, underlying collateral and availability of relevant historical market loan loss data. 
 
 To arrive at a CECL reserve using the WARM method, we considered various factors including (i) historical loss experience in the commercial real estate lending market, (ii) timing of expected repayments and expected loan future funding, (iii) and our current and future view of the macroeconomic environment for a reasonable and supportable forecast period. We derive a historical loss rate predominately based on a commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS database with historical losses from 1998 through 2024 provided by a third party. We focus on the most relevant subset of CMBS data that is determined to be the most comparable to our own portfolio. The historical loss rate is further adjusted to consider expected macroeconomic conditions, such as commercial real estate price indices, unemployment rates and market liquidity, over reasonable and supportable forecast periods. There is significant uncertainty related to future macroeconomic conditions. Therefore, we also consider other loan specific credit quality factors such as the risk rating of the loan, a near-term maturity, nature of construction loans, and economic conditions specific to the property type of the underlying collateral. 
 
 For collateral dependent loans that we determine foreclosure of the collateral is probable, we measure the expected losses based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. For collateral dependent loans where we determine foreclosure is not probable, we apply a practical expedient to estimate expected losses using the difference between the collateral s fair value (less costs to sell the asset if repayment is expected through the sale of the collateral) and the amortized cost basis of the loan. A loan is determined to be collateral dependent if (i) a borrower or sponsor is experiencing financial difficulty, and (ii) the loan is expected to be substantially repaid through the sale of the underlying collateral; such determination requires the use of significant judgment and can be based on several factors subject to uncertainty. Considerations used in determination of financial difficulty may include, but are not limited to, whether the borrower's operating cash flow is sufficient to cover the current and future debt service requirements, the borrower s ability to refinance the loan, market liquidity and other circumstances that can affect the borrower s ability to satisfy its contractual obligations under the loan agreement. 
 
 Refer to Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the description of our significant accounting policies. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide the new disclosures and all the disclosures required under ASC 280. The guidance is effective for our 2024 annual reporting. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements, unless it is impracticable. We have not early adopted ASU 2023-07 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment rates and market value, while at the same time seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns. While risks are inherent in any business enterprise, we seek to quantify and justify risks in light of available returns and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Our investments are subject to credit risk, including the risk of default. The performance and value of our investments depend upon the sponsors' ability to operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and principal due to us. To monitor this risk, we review our investment portfolio and are in regular contact with the sponsors, monitoring performance of the collateral and enforcing our rights as necessary. 
 Inflation, rising interest rates and increasing costs may dampen consumer spending and slow corporate profit growth, which may negatively impact the value of underlying real estate collateral relating to our investments and impair our borrowers ability to execute on their business plans and potentially their ability to perform under the terms of their loan obligations. 
 
 Credit Yield Risk 
 
 Credit yields measure the return demanded on financial instruments by the lending market based on their risk of default. Increasing supply of credit-sensitive financial instruments and reduced demand will generally cause the market to require a higher yield on such financial instruments, resulting in a lower price for the financial instruments we hold. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The composition of our investments is such that rising interest rates will increase our net income, while declining interest rates will generally decrease our net income. Rate floors relating to our loan portfolio may offset some of the impact from declining rates. There can be no assurance that we will continue to utilize rate floors. There can be no assurance of how our net income may be affected in future quarters, which will depend on, among other things, the interest rate environment and our then-current portfolio. 
 
 In addition to the risks related to fluctuations in cash flows and asset values associated with movements in interest rates, there is also the risk of non-performance on floating-rate assets. In the case of a significant increase in interest rates, the cash flows of the collateral real estate assets may not be sufficient to pay debt service due under our loans, which may contribute to non-performance or, in severe cases, default. 
 
 Although the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 50 basis points on September 18, 2024, interest rates remain elevated and the timing, direction and extent of any future interest rate changes remain uncertain. In a period of declining interest rates, our interest income on floating-rate investments would generally decrease, while any decrease in the interest we are charged on our floating-rate debt may be subject to floors and may not compensate for such decrease in interest income. However, rate floors relating to our loan portfolio may offs et some of the impact from declining rates. In addition, interest we are charged on our fixed-rate debt would not change. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our accruing loan portfolio and related portfolio financing by principal amount earned or paid a floating rate of interest indexed to Term SOFR. Accordingly, our interest income and expense will generally change directionally with index rates; however, in certain circumstances, rate floors relating to our loan portfolio may partially offset the impact from changing rates. As of September 30, 2024, a 50 basis point and a 100 basis point decrease in the index rates would decrease our expected cash flows by appro ximately 1.2 million and 2.3 million, or 0.02) and 0.03) per common share, respectively, for the following three-month period. Conversely, a 50 basis point and a 100 basis point increase in the index rates would increase our expected cash flows by approximately 1.2 million and 2.3 million, or 0.02 and 0.03 per common share, respectively, for the same period. 
 
 Prepayment Risk 
 
 Prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid at an earlier date than anticipated, potentially causing the return on certain investments to be less than expected. As we receive prepayments of principal on our assets, any premiums paid on such 
 71 

assets are amortized against interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets. Conversely, discounts on such assets are accreted into interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the accretion of purchase discounts, thereby increasing the interest income earned on the assets. Additionally, we may not be able to reinvest the principal repaid at the same or higher yield of the original investment. 
 
 Higher interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve may lead to a decrease in prepayment speeds and an increase in the number of our borrowers who exercise extension options, which could extend beyond the term of certain secured financing agreements we use to finance our loan investments. This could have a negative impact on our results of operations, and in some situations, we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause us to incur losses. 
 
 Financing Risk 
 
 We finance our target assets using our repurchase facilities, our term lending agreements, our Term Loan Facility, Warehouse Facility, Asset Based Financing, secured term loan, collateralized loan obligations and through syndicating senior participations in our originated senior loans. Over time, as market conditions change, we may use other forms of leverage in addition to these methods of financing. Weakness or volatility in the financial markets, the CRE and mortgage markets or the economy generally could adversely affect one or more of our lenders or potential lenders and could cause one or more of our lenders or potential lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing, or to decrease the amount of our available financing through a market to market, or to increase the costs of that financing. 
 
 Real Estate Risk 
 
 The market values of commercial real estate assets are subject to volatility and may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could also cause us to suffer losses.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired controls. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
