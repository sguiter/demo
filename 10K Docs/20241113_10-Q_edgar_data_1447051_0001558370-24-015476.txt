 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in accrued interest receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company determines delinquency status by considering the number of days full payments required by the contractual terms of the loan are past due. The Company has a policy of placing loans on a nonaccrual basis when 90 days or more contractually delinquent or when, in the opinion of management, collection of all or part of the principal balance appears doubtful, unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued and not collected is reversed against current period provision for credit losses. For nonaccrual loans, the Company records payments received as a reduction in principal. A nonaccrual loan may be restored to an accrual basis when principal and interest payments are current and full payment of principal and interest is expected. The Company s off-balance sheet credit exposures are comprised of unfunded portions of existing loans, such as lines of credit and construction loans, and commitments to originate loans that are not conditionally cancellable by the Company. Under the CECL accounting standard, expected credit losses on these amounts are calculated using a forecasted estimate of the likelihood that funding of the unfunded amount/commitment will occur and the historical reversion rate. Changes to the reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures are recorded through increases or decreases to the provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had in reserves for off-balance sheet credit exposures at September 30, 2024 and reserves for off-balance sheet credit exposures at December 31, 2023. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the adequacy of the ACL and the reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures is determined by certain factors outside of the Company's control, such as the performance of our portfolios, changes in the economic environment including economic uncertainty, changes in interest rates and loan prepayments, and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets, the level of ACL, and the reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures. Additionally, the level of ACL and the reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures may fluctuate based on the balance and mix of the loan portfolio, changes in loan prepayments

All of the mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, which are U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, or Ginnie Mae, which is a U.S. government agency. Since the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, the Company does not intend to sell these investments until maturity, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such investments prior to recovery of its cost basis, no allowance for credit losses was recorded for these securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

When a mortgage loan becomes seriously delinquent or more contractually past due), it displays weaknesses that may result in a loss. As a loan becomes more delinquent, the likelihood of the borrower repaying the loan decreases and the loan becomes more collateral dependent. A mortgage loan becomes collateral dependent when the proceeds for repayment can be expected to come only from the sale or operation of the collateral and not from borrower repayments. Generally, appraisals are obtained after a loan becomes collateral dependent or is delinquent. The carrying value of collateral-dependent loans is adjusted to the fair value of the collateral less selling costs. Any commercial real estate, commercial, construction or equity loan that has a loan balance in excess of a specified amount is also periodically reviewed to determine whether the loan exhibits any weaknesses and is performing in accordance with its contractual terms. The amortized cost basis of collateral-dependent loans, excluding accrued interest receivable, was at December 31, 2023. These loans were collateralized by residential real estate in Hawaii. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the collateral less selling costs of these collateral-dependent loans

The amount at risk is the greater of the carrying value or fair value over the repurchase liability and refers to the potential loss to the Company if the secured lender fails to return the security at the maturity date of the agreement. All the agreements to repurchase are with JP Morgan Securities and the securities pledged are mortgage-backed securities issued and guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. The fair value of the securities pledged must exceed the repurchase liability by 5.00 . In the event of a decline in the fair value of securities pledged to less than the required amount due to market conditions or principal repayments, the Company is obligated to pledge additional securities or other suitable collateral to cure the deficiency.

The loan is secured by the shares purchased with the loan proceeds and will be repaid by the ESOP over the term of the loan with funds from Territorial Savings Bank s contributions to the ESOP and dividends payable on the shares. The interest rate on the ESOP loan is an adjustable rate equal to the . The interest rate adjusts annually and will be the prime rate on the first business day of the calendar year. Shares purchased by the ESOP are held by a trustee in an unallocated suspense account, and shares are released annually from the suspense account on a pro-rata basis as principal and interest payments are made by the ESOP to the Company. The trustee allocates the shares released among participants on the basis of each participant s proportional share of compensation relative to all participants. As shares are committed to be released from the suspense account, Territorial Savings Bank reports compensation expense based on the average fair value of shares released with a corresponding credit to stockholders equity. The shares committed to be released are considered outstanding for earnings per share computations. Compensation expense recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to and , respectively.

Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. Overview We have historically operated as a traditional thrift institution. The significant majority of our assets consist of long-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, which we have funded primarily with deposit inflows, cash balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, loan and security repayments, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank, proceeds from securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and proceeds from loan and security sales. As a result, we may be vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as our interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than our interest-earning assets, as occurred in 2023. We have continued our focus on originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Our emphasis on conservative loan underwriting has resulted in continued low levels of nonperforming assets. Our nonperforming assets, which include nonaccrual loans, totaled 2.3 million, or 0.11 of total assets at September 30, 2024 compared to 2.3 million, or 0.10 of total assets at December 31, 2023 . We recorded a provision for credit losses of 22,000 and a reversal of provision for credit losses of 147,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in loans in the consumer loan portfolio and a decrease in its forecasted prepayments. This increase to the provision was partially offset by a decrease in the forecasted charge-offs in the real estate portfolio and an increase in the forecasted prepayments in the real estate and commercial portfolio. The reversal of provision for credit losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in our real estate portfolio s forecasted charge-offs that was partially offset by a decrease in its forecasted prepayments. Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased by 65.0 million to 177.0 million and Federal Reserve Bank advances remained constant at 50.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Federal Home Loan Bank advances had a net increase of 115.0 million to 256.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We had no Federal Reserve Bank advances at September 30, 2023. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase remained constant at 10.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Our investments in mortgage-backed securities have been issued by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, which are U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, or Ginnie Mae, which is a U.S. government agency. These entities guarantee the payment of principal and interest on our mortgage-backed securities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we owned 674.3 million and 705.9 million, respectively, of mortgage-backed securities issued by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae. We did not record a provision for credit losses on investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 as all our securities were issued either by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. Critical Accounting Policies There are no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in Territorial Bancorp Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Assets. At September 30, 2024, our total assets were 2.2 billion, a decrease of 38.2 million, or 1.7 , from December 31, 2023. The decrease in assets was primarily due to decreases of 31.6 million in total investment securities and 20.8 million in total loans, that were partially offset by a 16.5 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were 143.1 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 16.5 million, or 13.0 , since December 31, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to a 33.7 million increase in deposits, a 31.6 million decrease in total investment securities, and a 20.8 million decrease in the loan portfolio, that were partially offset by a 65.0 million decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. Loans. Total loans were 1.3 billion at September 30, 2024, or 58.3 of total assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the loan portfolio decreased by 20.8 million, or 1.6 . The decrease in the loan portfolio primarily occurred as principal repayments exceeded the origination of new loans. Securities. Total investment securities, including 19.9 million of investment securities available for sale, were 674.3 million at September 30, 2024, or 30.7 of total assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the investment securities portfolio decreased by 31.6 million, or 4.5 . The decrease in the investment securities balance was primarily due to principal repayments. At September 30, 2024, none of the underlying collateral for the securities consisted of subprime or Alt-A (traditionally defined as nonconforming loans having less than full documentation) loans. Deposits. Deposits were 1.7 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 33.7 million, or 2.1 , since December 31, 2023. The growth in deposits was primarily due to an increase of 114.7 million in certificates of deposit, which was partially offset by decreases of 51.0 million in passbook savings and 26.7 million in checking accounts. The increase in certificates in deposit was primarily due to a 92.7 million increase in certificates of deposit held by state and local governments. The decrease in passbook savings and checking accounts occurred as customers sought higher interest rates than what we offer. Borrowings. Total borrowings were 237.0 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 65.0 million, or 21.5 , since December 31, 2023. Our borrowings consist of advances from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and funds borrowed under securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Stockholders Equity. Total stockholders equity was 248.7 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.3 million, or 0.9 , from 251.1 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in stockholders equity was primarily due to the net loss incurred during the year.

 Average Balance and Yields The following tables set forth the average balance sheet, yields and rates, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as we did not hold any tax-free investments. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average balances and are included with accrual loans in the tables. However, no interest income was attributed to nonaccrual loans. The yields set forth below include the effect of net deferred costs, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income of 71,000 and 197,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 51,000 and 153,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General. We had a net loss of 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 2.2 million decrease in earnings compared to net income of 880,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a 2.6 million decrease in net interest income which was partially offset by a 946,000 decrease in income taxes. Net Interest Income . Net interest income decreased by 2.6 million, or 25.4 , to 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Interest expense increased by 3.5 million, or 47.3 , primarily due to a 76 basis point increase in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities. Interest income increased by 929,000, or 5.3 , primarily due to an 18 basis point increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets. The net interest rate spread and net interest margin were 1.11 and 1.42 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.69 and 1.90 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest rate spread and in the net interest margin are attributable to the 76 basis point increase in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities, which was partially offset by the 18 basis point increase in the yield of average interest-earning assets. Interest Income. Interest income increased by 929,000, or 5.3 , to 18.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Interest income on other investments increased by 850,000, or 80.9 , to 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income on other investments was primarily due to an increase in the interest earned on our cash balances at the FRB. Our average cash balance at the FRB increased by 57.9 million from 63.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 121.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, the yield earned increased from 4.84 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.15 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest income on loans increased by 343,000, or 2.9 , from 11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . The increase in interest income on loans occurred because of a 15 basis point increase in the yield on loans which was partially offset by a 14.7 million, or 1.1 , decrease in the average balance of loans which occurred as loan repayments exceeded new loan originations. These increases in interest income were partially offset by a decrease in interest income on investment securities of 264,000, or 5.9 , from 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in interest income on investment securities was primarily due to a 41.1 million decrease in the average balance that was primarily due to principal repayments. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by 3.5 million, or 47.3 , to 10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by 3.1 million, or 56.6 , to 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to a 107.3 million, or 21.5 , increase in the average balance of certificates of deposit and a 66 basis point increase in the rate paid on certificates of deposit. The increase in the average balance was primarily due to an increase in state and local government certificates of deposit. The rate paid on certificates of deposit increased to 4.44 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.78 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily due to increases in market interest rates. Interest expense on savings accounts increased by 1.1 million, or 157.3 , to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 672,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on savings accounts occurred primarily because of a 65 basis point increase in the rate which was partially offset by a 82.5 million, or 10.6 , decrease in the average balance of savings accounts. The increase in the rates on savings accounts was primarily due to increases in market interest rates. The decrease in the average balance of savings accounts occurred primarily as customers transferred their funds to certificates of deposits, which had higher interest rates, or sought higher interest rates elsewhere. Interest expense on FRB advances was 600,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to a 50.0 million advance from the FRB Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) that was obtained to enhance our liquidity and to fund the decrease in deposits. There were no advances from the FRB during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on FHLB advances decreased by 182,000, or 9.6 , from 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in interest expense on FHLB advances 

 36 

Table of Contents 
 was primarily due to a 50.8 million decrease in the average balance of FHLB advances, which was partially offset by a 36 basis point increase in the average cost of advances. The changes in the average balance and average cost of FHLB advances was primarily due to 60.0 million of maturing FHLB advances that were paid off in the three months ended September 30, 2024 which had a relatively low average interest rate of 1.47 . Provision for Credit Losses. We recorded a provision for credit losses of 29,000 and a reversal of provision for credit losses of 259,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in loans in the consumer loan portfolio and a decrease in its forecasted prepayments. This increase to the provision was partially offset by a decrease in the forecasted charge-offs in the real estate portfolio and an increase in the forecasted prepayments in the real estate and commercial portfolio. The reversal of provision for credit losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in our real estate portfolio s forecasted charge-offs that was partially offset by a decrease in its forecasted prepayments. The provisions recorded resulted in the ratios of the allowance for credit losses to total loans of 0.39 and 0.38 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Nonaccrual loans totaled 2.3 million, or 0.18 of total loans at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Nonaccrual loans as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted primarily of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. The allowance at September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflects management s best estimate of losses over the life of loans in our portfolio in accordance with the CECL approach. For additional information, see Note (6), Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Noninterest Income. The following table summarizes changes in noninterest income between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) Service and other fees 273 298 (25) (8.4) Income on bank-owned life insurance 255 218 37 17.0 Net gain on sale of loans 19 19 Other 69 73 (4) (5.5) Total 616 589 27 4.6 Noninterest income increased by 27,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in bank-owned life insurance income was primarily due to higher market interest rates. Noninterest Expense. The following table summarizes changes in noninterest expense between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 4,899 5,176 (277) (5.4) Occupancy 1,813 1,819 (6) (0.3) Equipment 1,335 1,263 72 5.7 Federal deposit insurance premiums 392 246 146 59.3 Other general and administrative expenses 1,561 1,163 398 34.2 Total 10,000 9,667 333 3.4 Noninterest expense increased by 333,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other general and administrative expenses included 353,000 of merger related legal and consulting expenses and a writeoff of 135,000 of cash destroyed in the Maui wildfire that was deemed unrecoverable. The increase in federal deposit insurance premiums was primarily due to an increase in the Federal

Table of Contents 
 Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) premium rate. The increase in equipment expense was due to an increase in service bureau expense. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense and various benefit expenses, which was partially offset by a decrease in deferred salary expense for originating new loans. Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. The income tax benefit was 611,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting an effective tax benefit rate of 31.7 , compared to income tax expense of 335,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting an effective tax rate of 27.6 . Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General. We had a net loss of 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in earnings of 7.3 million compared to net income of 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to an 8.7 million decrease in net interest income, a 1.3 million increase in non-interest expense, and a 169,000 increase in the provision for credit losses. These decreases in earnings were partially offset by a 2.9 million decrease in income taxes. Net Interest Income . Net interest income decreased by 8.7 million, or 26.3 , to 24.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 33.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense increased by 11.7 million, or 64.5 , due to an 85 basis point increase in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities and a 7.3 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. Interest income increased by 3.0 million, or 5.8 , due to an 18 basis point increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets and a 5.4 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets. The net interest rate spread and net interest margin were 1.25 and 1.54 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.92 and 2.10 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases in the net interest rate spread and in the net interest margin are attributable to the 85 basis point increase in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities, which was partially offset by the 18 basis point increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets. Interest Income. Interest income increased by 3.0 million, or 5.8 , to 54.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 51.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income on other investments increased by 2.3 million, or 79.2 , to 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income on other investments was primarily due to an increase in the interest earned on our cash balances at the FRB. Our average cash balance at the FRB increased by 45.1 million from 63.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 108.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, the yield earned increased from 4.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.09 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest income on loans increased by 1.5 million, or 4.3 , to 36.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 35.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income on loans occurred because of a 15 basis point increase in the yield. These increases in interest income were partially offset by a 759,000, or 5.6 , decrease in interest income on investment securities from 13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in interest income on investment securities was primarily due to a 39.9 million decrease in the average balance that was primarily due to principal repayments. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by 11.7 million, or 64.5 , to 29.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 18.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by 9.4 million, or 70.9 , to 22.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to a 96 basis point increase in the rate paid on certificates of deposit and a 92.2 million increase in the average balance of certificates of deposit. The average rate paid on certificates of deposit increased to 4.30 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on savings accounts increased by 3.1 million, or 205.3 , to 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense on savings accounts occurred primarily because of a 62 basis point increase in the rate which was partially offset by a 109.6 million, or 13.4 , decrease in the average balance of savings accounts. The increase in the rates on 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 certificates of deposit and savings accounts were primarily due to increases in market interest rates. The changes in the average balance of savings accounts and certificates of deposit occurred primarily as customers transferred funds from savings accounts with relatively low interest rates to our certificates of deposit with higher interest rates or withdrew their deposits and sought higher interest rates elsewhere. Interest expense on advances from the FRB was 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a 50.0 million advance from the FRB BTFP that was obtained to enhance our liquidity and to fund the decrease in deposits. There were no advances from the FRB during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on FHLB advances rose by 548,000, or 11.5 , from 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in interest expense occurred because of a 41 basis point increase in the cost of FHLB advances and was partially offset by a 7.5 million, or 3.2 , decrease in the average FHLB advance balance. Provision for Credit Losses. We recorded a provision for credit losses of 22,000 and a reversal of provision for credit losses of 147,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in loans in the consumer loan portfolio and a decrease in its forecasted prepayments. This increase to the provision was partially offset by a decrease in the forecasted charge-offs in the real estate portfolio and an increase in the forecasted prepayments in the real estate and commercial portfolio. The reversal of provision for credit losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in our real estate portfolio s forecasted charge-offs that was partially offset by a decrease in its forecasted prepayments. The provisions recorded resulted in ratios of the allowance for credit losses to total loans of 0.39 and 0.38 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Nonaccrual loans totaled 2.3 million, or 0.18 of total loans at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Nonaccrual loans as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted primarily of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. The allowance at September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflects management s best estimate of losses over the life of loans in our portfolio in accordance with the CECL approach. For additional information see Note (6), Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Noninterest Income. The following table summarizes changes in noninterest income between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) Service and other fees 885 1,022 (137) (13.4) Income on bank-owned life insurance 750 628 122 19.4 Net gain on sale of loans 19 10 9 90.0 Other 215 208 7 3.4 Total 1,869 1,868 1 0.1 
 Noninterest income increased by 1,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in bank-owned life insurance income was primarily due to higher market interest rates. Service and other fees decreased primarily due to a decrease in broker fee income, appraisal fee income, and NOW return item fees.

 Noninterest Expense. The following table summarizes changes in noninterest expense between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 14,606 15,723 (1,117) (7.1) Occupancy 5,319 5,201 118 2.3 Equipment 3,987 3,878 109 2.8 Federal deposit insurance premiums 1,281 737 544 73.8 Other general and administrative expenses 4,851 3,251 1,600 49.2 Total 30,044 28,790 1,254 4.4 
 Noninterest expense increased by 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other general and administrative expenses included 1.2 million of merger related legal and consulting expenses and a writeoff of 135,000 of cash destroyed in the Maui wildfire that was deemed unrecoverable. The increase in federal deposit insurance premiums was primarily due to an increase in the FDIC premium rate. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense and various benefit expenses which was partially offset by a decrease in deferred salary expense for originating new loans. Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. The income tax benefit was 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting an effective tax benefit rate of 30.7 , compared to income tax expense of 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting an effective tax rate of 27.1 . Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations. Our primary obligations include meeting the borrowing needs of our customers, fulfilling deposit withdrawals, interest payment on deposits, and repayment of borrowings. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, cash balances at the FRB, loan and security repayments, advances from the FHLB and FRB, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and proceeds from loan and security sales. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage and mortgage-backed security prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. We have established an Asset/Liability Management Committee, consisting of our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Operating Officer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, our Executive Vice President of Finance, and our Vice President and Senior Treasury Analyst, which is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs as of September 30, 2024. We regularly monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (i) expected loan demand; (ii) purchases and sales of investment securities; (iii) expected deposit flows and borrowing maturities; (iv) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (v) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits or securities and may also be used to pay off short-term borrowings.

Table of Contents 
 Our most liquid asset is cash. The amount of this asset is dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 143.1 million. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the FHLB and FRB, which provide an additional source of funds. We also utilize securities sold under agreements to repurchase as another borrowing source. At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow an additional 364.3 million and 158.7 million from the FHLB and FRB, respectively. In addition, we had the ability to borrow up to 61.1 million, using our unpledged securities as collateral, from the FRB or using securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Our cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We had estimated uninsured deposits (in excess of the federal deposit insurance limit of 250,000) of 507.0 million, or 30.4 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024, compared to an estimated 419.4 million, or 25.6 of total deposits as of December 31, 2023. The increase in uninsured deposits was primarily due to a 92.7 million increase in certificates of deposit held by state and local governments which was used to payoff 65.0 million of maturing FHLB advances and to increase our liquidity. Our estimate is calculated on the same basis used for regulatory reporting. We have no deposits that are uninsured for any other reason. At September 30, 2024, we had 3.1 million in loan commitments outstanding for fixed-rate loans and had 17.6 million in unused lines of credit to borrowers. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024 totaled 628.4 million, or 37.6 of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we may be required to seek other sources of funds, including loan and security sales, brokered deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and FHLB and FRB advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before September 30, 2025. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. Our primary investing activities are originating loans and purchasing mortgage-backed securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we originated 51.3 million and 83.0 million of loans, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , w e purchased securities with a face value of 6.8 million. We did not purchase any securities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts, FHLB advances, FRB advances, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, stock repurchases, and dividend payments. We experienced a net increase in deposits of 33.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors, and by other factors. At September 30, 2024, FHLB and FRB advances were 177.0 million and 50.0 million, respectively. A t December 31, 2023, FHLB and FRB advances were 242.0 million and 50.0 million, respectively. Territorial Bancorp Inc. is a separate legal entity from Territorial Savings Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay dividends, repurchase shares of its common stock, and for other corporate purposes. Territorial Bancorp Inc. s primary source of liquidity is dividend payments from Territorial Savings Bank. The ability of Territorial Savings Bank to pay dividends to Territorial Bancorp Inc. is subject to regulatory requirements. At September 30, 2024, Territorial Bancorp Inc. (on an unconsolidated, stand-alone basis) had liquid assets of 15.8 million. Territorial Savings Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. Territorial Bancorp Inc. is not subject to regulatory capital requirements because its total assets are less than 3.0 billion. At September 30, 2024, Territorial Savings Bank exceeded all of the fully phased in regulatory capital requirements and is considered to be well capitalized under regulatory guidelines.

 The tables below present the fully-phased in capital required to be considered well-capitalized and meet the regulatory capital conservation buffer requirement as a percentage of total and risk-weighted assets and the percentage and the total amount of capital maintained for Territorial Savings Bank and the Company at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 (1) The required Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios are based on the fully-phased in capital ratios in the Basel III capital regulations plus the 2.50 capital conservation buffer. Prompt Corrective Action provisions define specific capital categories based on an institution s capital ratios. However, the regulators may impose higher minimum capital standards on individual institutions or may downgrade an institution from one capital category to a lower category because of safety and soundness concerns. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prompt Corrective Action provisions impose certain restrictions on institutions that are undercapitalized. The restrictions imposed become increasingly more severe as an institution s capital category declines from undercapitalized to critically undercapitalized. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank s capital ratios exceeded the minimum capital thresholds for a well-capitalized institution. There are no conditions or events that have changed the institution s category under the capital guidelines. Depending on the amount of dividends to be paid, the Bank is required to either notify or make application to the Federal Reserve Bank before dividends are paid to the Company.

 The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, are required to establish a community bank leverage ratio between 8 to 10 of average total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions with assets of less than 10 billion. Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirements and electing to follow the alternative framework would be deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk based requirements. The federal regulators have currently adopted 9 as the applicable ratio. We have not elected to follow the alternative framework. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our potential future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. In addition, we enter into commitments to sell mortgage loans. Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities, and agreements with respect to investments. Between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, there have not been any material changes in our contractual obligations or funding needs. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE S ABOUT MARKET RISK General . Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Our Board of Directors has established an Asset/Liability Management Committee, which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity, and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Because we have historically operated as a traditional thrift institution, the significant majority of our assets consist of long-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, which we have funded primarily with deposit inflows, cash balances at the FRB, loan and security repayments, advances from the FHLB and FRB, our capital, proceeds from securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and proceeds from loan and security sales. In addition, there is little demand for adjustable-rate mortgage loans in the Hawaii market area. This has resulted in our being particularly vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as our interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than our interest-earning assets. Our policies do not permit hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage-backed securities. Economic Value of Equity. We use an interest rate sensitivity analysis that computes changes in the economic value of equity (EVE) of our cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. EVE represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, with adjustments made for off-balance sheet items. This analysis assesses the risk of loss in market-risk-sensitive instruments in the event of an instantaneous and sustained 100 to 400 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3 to 4 would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates column below.

Table of Contents 
 The following table presents our internal calculations of the estimated changes in our EVE as of June 30, 2024 (the latest date for which we have available information) that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the interest rate yield curve.

 (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. (2) EVE is the difference between the present value of an institution s assets and liabilities. (3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets. (4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets. Interest rates on Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities decreased by 57 basis points between June 30, 2024 and Septemer 30, 2024. The decrease in mortgage interest rates has increased the value of our interest-earning assets. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in EVE. Modeling changes in EVE requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the EVE table presented assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the EVE table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our EVE and net interest income and will differ from actual results. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURE S An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
