The Company, through BCT, holds rights to commercialize certain stem cell technology developed by Ramot of Tel Aviv University Ltd. Ramot ), (see Note 3). Using this technology, the Company has been developing novel adult stem cell therapies for debilitating neurodegenerative disorders such as ALS, also known as Lou Gherig Disease, PMS and Parkinson s disease. The Company developed a proprietary process, called NurOwn , for the propagation of MSCs and their differentiation into neurotrophic factor secreting cells. These cells are then transplanted at or near the site of damage, offering the hope of more effectively treating neurodegenerative diseases. The process is currently autologous, or self-transplanted. C. A reverse stock split of the Company s shares of Common Stock by a ratio of one-for-fifteen (the Reverse Stock Split was effected on September 30, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. pursuant to an amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation approved by the stockholders of the Company on September 16, 2024. The Company adjusted all ordinary shares, options, warrants, per share data and exercise prices included in these financial statements for all periods presented to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. D. Since its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all its efforts to research and development. The Company is still in its development and clinical stage and has not yet generated revenues. The Company has incurred operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the near-term. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately 224,000 . The extent of the Company s future operating losses and the timing of becoming profitable are uncertain. As of September 30, 2024 the cash balance is . 
 The Company s primary sources of cash have been proceeds from the issuance and sale of its Common Stock and warrants, the exercise of warrants, sales of Common Stock via its at-the-market ATM program and other funding transactions. While the Company has been successful in raising financing recently and in the past, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. The Company has not yet commercialized any of its product candidates. Even if the Company commercializes one or more of its product candidates, it may not become profitable in the near-term. The Company s ability to achieve profitability depends on several factors, including its ability to obtain regulatory approval for its product candidates, successfully complete any post-approval regulatory obligations and successfully commercialize its product candidates alone or in partnership. Such conditions raise substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan includes raising funds from outside potential investors via its ATM program and other potential funds as mentioned. However, as mentioned above, there is no assurance such funding will be available to the Company or that it will be obtained on terms favorable to the Company or will provide the Company with sufficient funds to meet its objectives. These interim condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets, carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Company Overview Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. is a leading biotechnology company committed to the development and commercialization of best-in-class autologous cellular therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig s disease); PMS; AD; and other neurodegenerative diseases. NurOwn , our proprietary cell therapy platform, leverages cell culture methods to induce autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs to secrete high levels of neurotrophic factors NTFs ), modulate neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease processes, promote neuronal survival and improve neurological function. NurOwn has completed its Phase 3 ALS and Phase 2 PMS clinical trials. On November 17, 2020, we announced top-line data from our Phase 3 ALS trial. On March 24, 2021, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2 trial evaluating three repeated intrathecal administrations of NurOwn , each given 2 months apart, as a treatment for PMS. On June 24, 2020, we announced a new clinical program focused on the development of NurOwn as a treatment for AD. On August 15, 2022, we announced our decision to submit a Biologics License Application BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. On September 9, 2022, we filed a BLA to the FDA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. On November 10, 2022, we announced that we had received a refusal to file RTF letter from the FDA regarding our BLA. The FDA indicated that we may request a Type A meeting to discuss the content of the RTF letter. On December 12, 2022, we announced the submission of a Type A meeting request with the FDA to discuss the contents of the RTF letter previously issued by the FDA regarding the BLA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. On December 27, 2022, we announced that the FDA granted a Type A meeting to discuss the contents of the RTF letter previously issued regarding our BLA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. The Type A Meeting was held on January 11, 2023. The perspective shared by the FDA review team reflected what was in the previously issued RTF letter. Conversations with the FDA on the best pathway to resolve the outstanding questions that remained continued, following the Type A meeting. During these discussions, Brainstorm was presented with multiple options to return the BLA to regulatory review, which included the regulatory procedure to File over Protest. Additionally, within these discussions, the FDA committed to review amendments that were filed to address items raised in the RTF letter. These discussions resulted in Brainstorm requesting the FDA to file our BLA over Protest, as this was the regulatory procedure that would allow us to reach an ADCOM in the shortest amount of time. Brainstorm notified the FDA on February 6, 2023 of our decision to request the FDA to file the NurOwn BLA for ALS over Protest. We received confirmation from the FDA that the BLA was re-filed on February 7, 2023. We received the FDA Type A meeting minutes on February 9, 2023. We submitted an amendment to our BLA on March 7, 2023, in which we responded to the majority of the items included in the RTF letter. Written feedback was received on March 22, 2023, from the FDA project manager associated with the BLA confirming the FDA s decision to grant an ADCOM for the NurOwn BLA for ALS. On March 27, 2023, we announced that the FDA will hold an ADCOM to discuss the company s BLA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. On June 6, 2023, we announced that the advisory committee meeting has been scheduled for September 27, 2023. On September 22, 2023, we submitted an amendment to our BLA to revise the indication to NurOwn for the treatment of mild to moderate ALS. On September 27, 2023, we announced that the Advisory Committee voted, with 17 voting no, one voting yes, and one abstention, that NurOwn did not demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness for treatment of mild to moderate ALS. On October 18, 2023, we announced that FDA invited the Company to request an expedited face-to-face meeting to discuss the path forward for NurOwn as a treatment for ALS. Brainstorm remains committed to the ALS Community and is actively exploring the next steps in support of NurOwn , including publication of emerging clinical data and development of a protocol for an additional clinical study. On October 18, 2023 Brainstorm announced that the BLA for NurOwn would be withdrawn. The BLA was withdrawn on November 3, 2023. The decision to withdraw the BLA was coordinated with FDA and is viewed by FDA as a withdrawal without prejudice. On November 20, 2023, we announced that the FDA granted the company a meeting to discuss the regulatory path forward for NurOwn in ALS. The meeting took place on December 6, 2023. On December 7, 2023, we announced the completion of a productive meeting with the FDA to discuss NurOwn . The primary objective of the meeting was to discuss plans for a Special Protocol Assessment SPA with FDA on the overall protocol design for a planned Phase 3b registrational trial for NurOwn . The ultimate goal of the SPA is to secure the FDA s agreement that critical elements of the overall protocol design (e.g., entry criteria, endpoints, planned analyses) are adequate and acceptable for a study intended to support a future marketing application. On February 23, 2024, we announced that we submitted the SPA request to the FDA for the planned Phase 3b clinical trial of NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. On April 9, 2024, the Company announced that it received written agreement from the FDA, under a SPA, on the design for a Phase 3b trial of NurOwn in ALS. The SPA agreement with the FDA validates the clinical trial protocol and statistical analysis of the planned Phase 3b trial of NurOwn, demonstrating the Company s adequacy in addressing objectives that support a future BLA in ALS. On June 26, 2024, the Company announced that it has reached alignment with FDA on the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) aspects of Brainstorm s Phase 3b clinical trial for NurOwn (R), its investigational therapy for ALS. This Type C meeting builds upon the positive momentum established in April 2024, when the FDA granted BrainStorm a SPA agreement for its NurOwn Phase 3b trial.

On October 30, 2024, the Company announced that on October 29, 2024, the Company received written notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market stating that the Company has regained compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Accordingly, the Company s common stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to the Company s compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements. On November 11, 2024, the Company announced that it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Pluri Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUR) through its wholly owned subsidiary Pluri ), an established global leader in the development and manufacturing of cell-based therapeutics, to manufacture NurOwn for use in BrainStorm s planned Phase 3b trial in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This MOU enables BrainStorm to begin transfer of its manufacturing technology and start producing NurOwn at Pluri s manufacturing facility upon finalizing the binding definitive agreement. 
 NurOwn Proprietary Technology NurOwn technology is based on an innovative manufacturing protocol, which induces the differentiation of purified and expanded bone marrow-derived MSC and consistently generates cells that release high levels of multiple neurotrophic factors MSC-NTF cells) to modulate neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease processes, promote neuronal survival and improve neurological function. These factors are known to be critical for the growth, survival and differentiation of neurons, including: glial-derived neurotrophic factor GDNF brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF hepatocyte growth factor HGF ), and Galectin-1 among others. VEGF is one of the most potent neuronal and motor neuron survival factors and has demonstrated important neuroprotective effects in ALS and several other neurodegenerative diseases. NurOwn manufacturing involves a multi-step process that includes the following: harvesting and isolating undifferentiated stem cells from the patient s own bone marrow; processing of cells at the manufacturing site; cryopreservation of MSC to enable multiple treatments from a single bone marrow sample; and intrathecal administration of MSC-NTF cells into the same patient by standard lumbar puncture. This administration procedure does not require hospitalization and has been shown to be generally well tolerated in multiple CNS clinical trials to date. The completed NurOwn U.S. Phase 3 ALS and the NurOwn U.S. Phase 2 PMS trials evaluated the therapeutic potential of repeated intrathecal MSC-NTF cell administration (three doses at bi-monthly intervals). Our highest priority is to obtain regulatory approval of NurOwn for ALS. We are also strategically focused on fully executing the clinical development of NurOwn in PMS, reviewing the optimal approach in AD and will consider the best course of action based on recent scientific and regulatory insights.

 The proprietary technology and manufacturing processing of NurOwn (MSC-NTF cells) for clinical use is conducted in full compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice. The NurOwn proprietary technology is fully owned or developed by our Israeli Subsidiary. All granted patents related to NurOwn (MSC-NTF cells) manufacturing process are fully assigned to or owned by our Israeli Subsidiary (please see Intellectual Property section for details). The NurOwn Treatment Process Bone marrow aspiration from the patient; MSC Isolation and propagation; MSC Cryopreservation; MSC thawing and differentiation into neurotrophic-factor secreting (MSC-NTF; NurOwn cells; and Intrathecal administration into the patient s cerebrospinal fluid by standard lumbar puncture. 
 Differentiation before Treatment We believe that the ability to induce autologous adult MSCs into differentiated MSC-NTF cells makes NurOwn uniquely suited for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The specialized MSC-NTF cells secrete multiple neurotrophic factors and immunomodulatory cytokines that may result in: Protection of existing neurons; Promotion of neuronal repair; Neuronal functional improvement; and Immunomodulation and reduced neuroinflammation. 
 Autologous treatment The NurOwn technology platform is autologous, using the patient s own bone-marrow derived stem cells for treatment. In autologous cellular treatment, there is no introduction of unrelated donor antigens that may lead to alloimmunity, no risk of rejection, and no need for treatment with immunosuppressive agents, which can cause severe and/or long-term side effects. In addition, the use of adult, autologous stem cells is free of several ethical concerns associated with the use of embryonic-derived stem cells in some countries. NurOwn ALS Clinical Program We announced top-line data from the Phase 3 clinical trial of NurOwn in ALS on November 17, 2020. We have been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for this indication, and have been granted Orphan Drug Status, in the U.S. and Europe, which provides us the potential for an extended period of exclusivity. On August 15, 2022, we announced our decision to submit a BLA to the FDA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. The BLA was filed on September 9, 2022. On November 10, 2022, we announced that we had received a RTF letter from the FDA regarding our BLA. The FDA indicated that we could request a Type A meeting to discuss the content of the RTF letter, and Type A meeting was held on January 11, 2023. On March 27, 2023, we announced that the FDA will hold an ADCOM to discuss the company s BLA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. On June 6, 2023, we announced that the advisory committee meeting has been scheduled for September 27, 2023. On September 22, 2023, we submitted an amendment to our BLA to revise the indication to NurOwn for the treatment of mild to moderate ALS. On September 27, 2023 we announced that the Advisory Committee voted, with 17 voting no, one voting yes, and one abstention, that NurOwn did not demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness for treatment of mild to moderate ALS. On October 18, 2023, we announced that the FDA invited the Company to request an expedited face-to-face meeting to discuss the path forward for NurOwn as a treatment for ALS. Brainstorm remains committed to the ALS Community and is actively exploring the next steps in support of NurOwn , including publication of emerging clinical data and development of a protocol for an additional clinical study. On October 18, 2023 Brainstorm announced that the BLA for NurOwn would be withdrawn. The BLA was withdrawn on November 3, 2023. The decision to withdraw the BLA was coordinated with the FDA and is viewed by the FDA as a withdrawal without prejudice. On November 20, 2023, we announced that the FDA granted the company

 a meeting to discuss the regulatory path forward for NurOwn in ALS. The meeting took place on December 6, 2023. On December 7, 2023, we announced the completion of a productive meeting with the FDA to discuss NurOwn . The primary objective of the meeting was to discuss plans for a SPA with the FDA on the overall protocol design for a planned Phase 3b registrational trial for NurOwn . The ultimate goal of the SPA is to secure the FDA s agreement that critical elements of the overall protocol design (e.g., entry criteria, endpoints, planned analyses) are adequate and acceptable for a study intended to support a future marketing application. On February 23, 2024, we announced that we submitted the SPA request to the FDA for the planned Phase 3b clinical trial of NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. On April 9, 2024, the Company announced that it received written agreement from the FDA, under a SPA, on the design for a Phase 3b trial of NurOwn in ALS. The SPA agreement with the FDA validates the clinical trial protocol and statistical analysis of the planned Phase 3b trial of NurOwn, demonstrating the Company s adequacy in addressing objectives that support a future BLA in ALS. On June 26, 2024, the Company announced that it has reached alignment with FDA on the CMC aspects of Brainstorm s Phase 3b clinical trial for NurOwn (R), its investigational therapy for ALS. This Type C meeting builds upon the positive momentum established in April 2024, when the FDA granted BrainStorm a SPA agreement for its NurOwn Phase 3b trial. Phase 1/2 ALS Open Label Trials We have completed two early stage Phase 1/2 and 2 open-label clinical trials of NurOwn in patients with ALS at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel, as well as a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial at three prestigious U.S. Medical centers - the Massachusetts General Hospital MGH in Boston, Massachusetts Memorial Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota - all highly experienced in the management, investigation, and treatment of ALS. The first two open-label trials were approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health MoH ). The first-in-human trial, a Phase 1 safety and efficacy trial of NurOwn administered either intramuscularly or intrathecally in 12 ALS patients, was initiated in June 2011. In the Phase 2 dose-escalating study, 14 ALS patients were administered NurOwn by a combined route of intramuscular and intrathecal administration. These studies demonstrated the tolerability of NurOwn by both routes of administration and showed preliminary signs of activity. In January 2016, the results of the two completed Phase 1/2 study and Phase 2 open label trials were published in JAMA Neurology. The results demonstrated a slower rate of disease progression following MSC-NTF cell treatment as measured by the ALSFRS-R, the gold standard for the evaluation of ALS functional status, and Forced Vital Capacity, a measure of pulmonary function, as well as positive trends in the rate of decline of muscle volume and the compound motor axon potential. This was the first published clinical data using autologous MSCs induced under culture conditions to produce NTFs, with the potential to deliver a combined neuroprotective and immunomodulatory therapeutic effect in ALS and potentially modify the course of this disease. Phase 2 ALS Randomized Trial The Phase 2 U.S. study was conducted under an FDA Investigational New Drug application. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center U.S. Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating NurOwn in ALS patients was conducted at three clinical sites: (i) the MGH in Boston, (ii) Massachusetts Memorial Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts, and (iii) the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. For this trial, NurOwn was manufactured at the Connell and O Reilly Cell Manipulation Core Facility at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and at the Human Cellular Therapy Lab at the Mayo Clinic. In this study, 48 patients were randomized 3:1 to receive NurOwn or placebo. Results of this Phase 2 Study were published in the peer reviewed Journal Neurology . The publication titled NurOwn, Phase 2, Randomized, Clinical Trial in Patients with ALS: Safety, Clinical, and Biomarker Results was published in December 2019. Key findings from the trial were as follows: The study achieved its primary objective, demonstrating that NurOwn treatment was well-tolerated. There were no discontinuations from the trial due to adverse events AEs and there were no deaths in the study. The most common AEs of mild or moderate severity, were transient procedure-related AEs such as headache, back pain, pyrexia arthralgia and injection-site discomfort, which were more commonly seen in the NurOwn -treated participants compared to placebo. NurOwn achieved multiple secondary efficacy endpoints, showing evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit. Notably, response rates in the ALS functional rating scale (48-point ALSFRS-R outcome measure) were higher in NurOwn -treated participants, compared to placebo, at all study timepoints over 24 weeks.

 A pre-specified responder analysis examined percentage improvements in the post treatment ALSFRS-R slope (in points change per month) compared to pre-treatment slope and demonstrated that a higher proportion of NurOwn treated participants achieved a 100 improvement in the post-treatment vs. pre-treatment slope, compared to the placebo group. This analysis also demonstrated that a higher proportion of the NurOwn treated participants achieved a 1.5 point per month or greater improvement in the post-treatment vs. pre-treatment ALSFRS-R slope, compared to the placebo group. The treatment effects were greater in the rapid progressor subgroup (a pre-specified definition, in which pretreatment ALSFRS-R declined by 2 or more points in the three months pre-treatment). As an important confirmation of NurOwn s mechanism of action, levels of neurotrophic factors and inflammatory markers were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF samples collected from participants pre-treatment and two weeks post treatment. In the samples of those participants treated with NurOwn , statistically significant increases in levels of neurotrophic factors VEGF, HGF and LIF and a statistically significant reduction in inflammatory markers MCP-1, SDF-1 and CHIT-1 were observed post-treatment. Furthermore, the observed reduction in inflammatory markers correlated with ALS functional improvements. These clinical-biomarker correlations were not seen in placebo-treated participants, consistent with the proposed combined neuroprotective and immunomodulatory mechanism of action of NurOwn in ALS. In summary, a higher proportion of NurOwn treated participants, particularly those with more rapid disease progression, experienced stabilization or improvement in ALS function, as measured by the change in post-treatment vs. pre-treatment ALSFRS-R rate of decline or slope. Phase 3 ALS Clinical Trial Following successful completion of the Phase 2 study, we conducted a Phase 3 trial (a multi-dose double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial protocol) that was designed to generate data to potentially support a BLA submission in the U.S. for NurOwn in ALS. In October 2019, the clinical trial completed enrollment of an enriched patient population of rapid progressors based on superior outcomes observed in the Phase-2 pre-specified sub-group. The study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03280056). We announced top-line data from our Phase 3 ALS trial on November 17, 2020. Results from the trial showed that NurOwn was generally well tolerated in the population of rapidly progressing ALS patients. However, the trial did not reach statistically significant results. No new safety concerns were identified. On February 9, 2021, we announced feedback from our Type-C Meeting with the FDA to review specific aspects of our planned manufacturing modifications to support the development of a semi-automated commercial manufacturing process for NurOwn (MSC-NTF cell). On February 22, 2021, we announced high-level FDA feedback on NurOwn ALS clinical development program. The FDA concluded from their initial review that the clinical data provided at the time did not provide the threshold of substantial evidence that the FDA seeks to support a BLA. In addition, the FDA advised that this recommendation did not preclude the Company from proceeding with a BLA submission. Key findings from the trial were as follows (which include the update to the data published in Muscle Nerve 65(3):291-302 on August 12, 2022): NurOwn was generally well tolerated in this population of rapidly progressing ALS patients. While showing a numerical improvement in the treated group compared to placebo across the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, the trial did not reach statistically significant results. The primary efficacy endpoint, a responder analysis evaluating the proportion of participants who experienced at least a 1.25 points per month improvement in the post-treatment ALSFRS-R slope compared to pre-treatment, was powered on assumed treatment response rates of 35 on NurOwn versus 15 on Placebo. These estimates were based on available historical clinical trial data and the NurOwn Phase 2 data. The response definition for the primary endpoint was met by 32.6 of NurOwn participants versus 27.7 for Placebo (p=0.453). Therefore, the trial met the expected ~35 NurOwn treatment group efficacy response assumption, however the high rate of response in placebo participants exceeded the placebo response expected based on contemporary ALS trials.

 The secondary efficacy endpoint measuring average change in ALSFRS-R total score from baseline to Week 28, was -5.52 with NurOwn versus -5.88 on Placebo, a difference of 0.36 (p= 0.693). 
 In an important, pre-specified subgroup early in the disease course based on an ALSFRS-R baseline score of 35 or greater, NurOwn demonstrated a clinically meaningful treatment response across the primary and key secondary endpoints and remained consistent with our pre-trial, data-derived assumptions. In this subgroup, there were 34.6 responders who met the primary endpoint definition on NurOwn and 15.6 on Placebo (p=0.305), and the average change from baseline to week 28 in ALSFRS-R total score was -1.56 on NurOwn and -3.65 on Placebo (p=0.050), an improvement of 2.09 ALSFRS-R points favoring NurOwn . Additional sensitivity analyses have demonstrated consistent treatment effects with NurOwn after accounting for the impact of the ALSFRS-R floor effect. Two methods include: (1) Total Score Threshold TST ), which removed participants with ALSFRS-R scores 25; and (2) Item Level Threshold ITL ), which removed participants with a baseline score of 0 or 1 in at least 5 of 6 of the ALSFRS-R s Fine and Gross Motor scale items. Applying the TST and ITL sensitivity analysis methods resulted in the exclusion of 23 (n=44) and 16 (n=30) of trial participants from analyses, respectively. Both the TST and ILT sensitivity analysis methods show that, after controlling for the impact of the ALSFRS-R floor effect, participants treated with NurOwn had a higher rate of clinical response (primary endpoint) and less function lost across 28 weeks (secondary endpoint), compared to placebo. Additional post-hoc analyses published for the secondary endpoint (average change from baseline in ALSFRS-R), showed a statistically significant benefit following treatment with NurOwn in all subgroups with ALSFRS-R baseline total score of at least 26 to 35 (p 0.050). The NurOwn Phase 3 trial enrolled a broad set of participants, including some with advanced ALS disease (ALSFRS-R 25) at baseline, making this trial subject to the impact of floor effects of the ALSFRS-R and reduced ALSFRS-R sensitivity. A post-hoc analysis was done using participants with baseline ALSFRS-R>25 for the primary endpoint and the response for NurOwn was 34.7 and 20.5 for Placebo, p=0.053. This analysis suggests a treatment effect with NurOwn in participants with less advanced disease. CSF biomarker analyses confirmed that treatment with NurOwn resulted in a statistically significant increase of neurotrophic factors (VEGF) and reduction in neurodegenerative (neurofilament) and neuroinflammatory biomarkers (MCP-1) that was not observed in the placebo treatment group. Pre-specified statistical modeling designed to predict clinical response with high sensitivity and specificity based on ALS biomarkers and ALS Function confirmed that NurOwn treatment outcomes could be predicted by baseline ALS function as well as key CSF neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory biomarkers. Additional analyses focused on the trajectory of biomarkers for the subgroups of participants with baseline ALSFRS-R scores >25 and 25, those most likely to be impacted by the floor effect of the scale, indicate that NurOwn had similar biological effects on ALS participants regardless of the level of disease progression at baseline. Specifically, we observe decreases in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative markers and increases in neuroprotective markers in NurOwn treated participants compared to placebo in both subgroups. 
 Decision to Submit BLA New clinical analyses of NurOwn s Phase 3 clinical trial in ALS published August 12, 2022, led to a correction of data originally published in Muscle Nerve in December 2021 and strengthened the Company s original conclusions from the trial. The correction resulted in a statistically significant treatment difference (p=0.050) of more than 2 points for an important secondary endpoint, average change from baseline in ALSFRS-R, in the pre-specified efficacy subgroup of participants with a baseline score of at least 35. Analyses reported in the original publication utilized an efficacy model that unintentionally deviated from the trial s pre-specified statistical analysis plan by erroneously incorporating interaction terms between the subgroup and treatment. The newly published results employ the efficacy model as pre-specified in the trial s statistical analysis plan, correcting the analyses. The correction also relates to the other subgroup analyses published for this endpoint, demonstrating that all subgroups with ALSFRS-R baseline scores of greater than 26 to 35 showed a statistically significant benefit following treatment with NurOwn (p 0.050). On August 15, 2022, we announced the decision to submit a BLA to the FDA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. The BLA was filed on September 9, 2022. On November 10, 2022, we announced that we had received a RTF letter from the FDA regarding our BLA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. The FDA informed us that the BLA is not sufficiently complete to enable a substantive review and that the FDA would therefore not file the BLA. The RTF letter contained a list of topics the FDA provided to Brainstorm as rationale for the BLA file being not sufficiently complete to enable a substantive review. According to the FDA, these reasons included one item

 related to the trial not meeting the standard for substantial evidence of effectiveness and CMC related items. The FDA indicated that we may request a Type A meeting to discuss the content of the RTF letter. On December 12, 2022, we announced the submission of a Type A meeting request with the FDA to discuss the contents of the RTF letter previously issued by the FDA regarding the BLA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. On December 27, 2022, we announced that the FDA granted a Type A meeting to discuss the contents of the RTF letter previously issued regarding our BLA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. The Type A Meeting was held on January 11, 2023. The perspective shared by the FDA review team reflected what was in the previously issued RTF letter. Conversations on the best pathway to resolve the outstanding questions that remained continued, following the Type A meeting. During these discussions, Brainstorm was presented with multiple options to return the BLA to regulatory review, which included the regulatory procedure to File over Protest. Additionally, within these discussions, the FDA committed to review amendments that were filed to address items raised in the RTF letter. These discussions resulted in Brainstorm requesting the FDA to file our BLA over Protest, as this was the regulatory procedure that would allow us to reach an ADCOM in the shortest amount of time. Brainstorm notified the FDA on February 6, 2023 of our decision to request the FDA to file the NurOwn BLA for ALS over Protest. We received confirmation from the FDA that the BLA was re-filed on February 7, 2023. We received the FDA Type A meeting minutes on February 9, 2023. We submitted an amendment to our BLA on March 7, 2023, in which we responded to the majority of the items included in the RTF letter. Written feedback was received on March 22, 2023, from the FDA project manager associated with the BLA confirming the FDA s decision to grant an ADCOM for the NurOwn BLA for ALS. On March 27, 2023, we announced that the FDA will hold an ADCOM to discuss the company s BLA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. On June 6, 2023, we announced that the advisory committee meeting has been scheduled for September 27, 2023. On September 22, 2023, we submitted an amendment to our BLA to revise the indication to NurOwn for the treatment of mild to moderate ALS. On September 27, 2023 we announced that the Advisory Committee voted, with 17 voting no, one voting yes, and one abstention, that NurOwn did not demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness for treatment of mild to moderate ALS. On October 18, 2023, we announced that the FDA invited the Company to request an expedited face-to-face meeting to discuss the path forward for NurOwn as a treatment for ALS. Brainstorm remains committed to the ALS Community and is actively exploring the next steps in support of NurOwn , including publication of emerging clinical data and development of a protocol for an additional clinical study. On October 18, 2023 Brainstorm announced that the BLA for NurOwn would be withdrawn. The BLA was withdrawn on November 3, 2023. The decision to withdraw the BLA was coordinated with the FDA and is viewed by the FDA as a withdrawal without prejudice. On November 20, 2023, we announced that the FDA granted the company a meeting to discuss the regulatory path forward for NurOwn in ALS. The meeting took place on December 6, 2023. On December 7, 2023, we announced the completion of a productive meeting with the FDA to discuss NurOwn . The primary objective of the meeting was to discuss plans for a SPA with the FDA on the overall protocol design for a planned Phase 3b registrational trial for NurOwn . The ultimate goal of the SPA is to secure the FDA s agreement that critical elements of the overall protocol design (e.g., entry criteria, endpoints, planned analyses) are adequate and acceptable for a study intended to support a future marketing application. On February 23, 2024, we announced that we submitted the SPA request to the FDA for the planned Phase 3b clinical trial of NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. On April 9, 2024, the Company announced that it received written agreement from the FDA, under a SPA, on the design for a Phase 3b trial of NurOwn in ALS. The SPA agreement with the FDA validates the clinical trial protocol and statistical analysis of the planned Phase 3b trial of NurOwn, demonstrating the Company s adequacy in addressing objectives that support a future BLA in ALS. On June 26, 2024, the Company announced that it has reached alignment with FDA on the CMC aspects of Brainstorm s Phase 3b clinical trial for NurOwn (R), its investigational therapy for ALS. This Type C meeting builds upon the positive momentum established in April 2024, when the FDA granted BrainStorm a SPA agreement for its NurOwn Phase 3b trial. NurOwn Clinical Manufacturing We have developed a validated cryopreservation process for the long-term storage of MSC, that allows multiple doses of NurOwn to be created from a single bone marrow harvest procedure in the multi-dose clinical trials and to avoid the need for patients to undergo repeated bone marrow aspiration. A validation study was conducted in 2017 comparing NurOwn derived from fresh MSC to those derived from cryopreserved MSC. Company scientists were successful in showing that the MSC can be stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen for prolonged periods of time, while maintaining their characteristics. Cryopreserved MSC are capable of differentiating into NurOwn , similar to the NurOwn derived from fresh MSC from the same patient/donor, prior to cryopreservation and maintain their key functional properties including immunomodulation and neurotrophic factor secretion.

 We contracted with City of Hope s Center for Biomedicine and Genetics to manufacture clinical supplies of NurOwn adult stem cells for our Phase 3 clinical study. City of Hope supported the manufacturing of NurOwn and placebo for the participants treated in the Phase 3 study. The Connell and O Reilly Cell Manipulation Core Facility at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute DFCI in Boston was also contracted to manufacture NurOwn and placebo for our Phase 3 ALS clinical study participants and commenced manufacturing in October 2018. DFCI core manufacturing facility also supplied NurOwn for our Phase 2 PMS study. On October 22, 2020, we announced a partnership with Catalent, the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies, to manufacture NurOwn , which has been evaluated for the treatment of ALS in our Phase 3 clinical trial. If we receive FDA approval for NurOwn in ALS, Catalent will be our partner for manufacturing commercial quantities of NurOwn to treat patients with ALS. Our technology transfer to Catalent Houston was successfully completed and enabled continuous supply of NurOwn for the EAP. As of November 1, 2023, the Company optimized its manufacturing capabilities, particularly in the production of NurOwn , by strategically leveraging partnerships and optimizing operational resources. The Company currently leases a GMP-certified cleanroom manufacturing center located at Sourasky Hospital, which serves as a critical hub for the production and distribution of NurOwn . This facility significantly enhances the Company s capacity to manufacture and distribute NurOwn within both the European Union (EU) and local Israeli markets. On December 7, 2021, we and Catalent announced completion of technology transfer for NurOwn manufacturing at the Catalent s cell therapy facility in Houston, Texas. Catalent Houston manufactured NurOwn for the EAP. As of December 31, 2022, seven participants have completed treatment with NurOwn that was manufactured at the Catalent facility as well as all Expanded Access protocol follow-up visits. We are currently negotiating a contract with a leading manufacturing contract development organization. Meetings with the FDA and FDA Senior Management In July 2019, the Brainstorm management team was invited to participate in a special in-person, high-level meeting with the senior management of the FDA Drug and Biologics Centers and, I AM ALS , a grassroots ALS advocacy group advocating for an ALS cure. FDA s Dr. Peter Marks, Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research CBER and Dr. Janet Woodcock Director, former of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research CDER were in attendance with senior FDA staff. Brainstorm s Phase 3 ALS principal Investigators Dr. Robert Brown (Massachusetts Memorial Hospital, Worcester, Massachusetts) and Dr. Merit Cudkowicz (MGH, Boston) joined by teleconference. The meeting s purpose was to discuss Brainstorm s ongoing Phase 3 ALS clinical trial as well as efforts to speed treatment access to the ALS patient community. The meeting enabled an open and effective dialogue between the FDA and Brainstorm, setting the stage for future meetings to explore practical options to quickly bring our investigational treatment to those living with ALS. On February 11, 2020, we announced that we held a high-level meeting with the FDA to discuss potential NurOwn regulatory pathways for approval in ALS. In the planned meeting with senior CBER leadership and several leading U.S. ALS experts, the FDA confirmed that the Phase 3 ALS trial was collecting relevant data critical to the assessment of NurOwn efficacy. The FDA indicated that they would look at the totality of the evidence in the expected Phase 3 clinical trial data. On February 9, 2021, we announced feedback on a Type-C Meeting with the FDA on future NurOwn manufacturing plans and to review specific aspects of our planned manufacturing modifications to support the development of a semi-automated commercial manufacturing process for NurOwn (MSC-NTF cell). The meeting included a detailed review of the requirements for comparability testing to support future modifications along with geographic considerations in the sourcing of starting materials and future manufacturing production. We plan to incorporate feedback from the FDA meeting in 2021, our experience from Phase 3 manufacturing, in addition to feedback received in recent interactions with FDA including the Type A meeting on December 6, 2023, to formalize our plan to satisfy FDA s expectations for CMC for a product in Phase 3 development.

 On February 22, 2021, we announced high-level FDA feedback on NurOwn ALS Clinical Development Program. The FDA concluded from their initial review that the current level of clinical data does not provide the threshold of substantial evidence that the FDA is seeking to support a BLA. In addition, the FDA advised that this recommendation does not preclude the Company from proceeding with a BLA submission. Following extensive consultations with principal investigators, ALS experts, expert statisticians, regulatory advisors, and ALS advocacy groups to discuss the best path forward to provide NurOwn for ALS patients, Brainstorm filed a BLA on September 9, 2022. On November 10, 2022, we announced that we had received a RTF letter from the FDA regarding our BLA, which informed us that the BLA was not sufficiently complete to enable a substantive review and that the FDA. The RTF letter contained a list of topics the FDA provided to BrainStorm as rationale for the BLA file being not sufficiently complete to enable a substantive review.

Written feedback was received on March 22, 2023 from the FDA project manager associated with the BLA confirming the FDA s decision to grant an ADCOM for the NurOwn BLA for ALS. We submitted an amendment to our BLA on March 7, 2023, in which we responded to the majority of the items included in the RTF letter. The BLA for NurOwn to treat ALS is currently under active review by the FDA. On March 27, 2023, we announced that the FDA will hold an ADCOM to discuss the company s BLA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. On June 6, 2023, we announced that the advisory committee meeting has been scheduled for September 27, 2023. On September 22, 2023, we submitted an amendment to our BLA to revise the indication to NurOwn for the treatment of mild to moderate ALS. On September 27, 2023 we announced that the Advisory Committee voted, with 17 voting no, one voting yes, and one abstention, that NurOwn did not demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness for treatment of mild to moderate ALS.

On November 20, 2023, we announced that the FDA granted the company a meeting to discuss the regulatory path forward for NurOwn in ALS. The meeting took place on December 6, 2023. On December 7, 2023, we announced the completion of a productive meeting with the FDA to discuss NurOwn . The primary objective of the meeting was to discuss plans for a SPA with the FDA on the overall protocol design for a planned Phase 3b registrational trial for NurOwn . The ultimate goal of the SPA is to secure the FDA s agreement that critical elements of the overall protocol design (e.g., entry criteria, endpoints, planned analyses) are adequate and acceptable for a study intended to support a future marketing application. On February 23, 2024, we announced that we submitted the SPA request to the FDA for the planned Phase 3b clinical trial of NurOwn for the treatment of ALS.

This Type C meeting builds upon the positive momentum established in April 2024, when the FDA granted BrainStorm a SPA agreement for its NurOwn Phase 3b trial. ALS Expanded Access Program On December 14, 2020, we announced the NurOwn EAP through which NurOwn would be made available for ALS patients who completed all Phase 3 scheduled treatments and follow-up assessments and meet specific eligibility criteria. The protocol for the EAP was developed in partnership with the FDA to provide access to NurOwn for Phase 3 clinical trial participants who meet specific eligibility criteria. Initially, participants less severely affected by ALS, as measured by ALSFRS-R, were the first to receive treatment. This approach is informed by recently announced top-line data from the Company s Phase 3 clinical trial. According to the FDA, EAPs, alternatively known as compassionate use programs, provide a pathway for patients to receive an investigational medicine for a serious disease or condition outside of a clinical trial.

 Through the EAP, the six clinical centers participating in the Phase 3 NurOwn trial each had the opportunity to treat ALS participants who completed the trial. These six centers are: University of California, Irvine; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; California Pacific Medical Center; MGH; University of Massachusetts Medical School; and the Mayo Clinic. EAP treatment of ALS participants who have completed the Phase 3 clinical trial did not interfere with data or regulatory timelines. The Cell Manipulation Core Facility CMCF at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute manufactured the investigational therapy, assisted by on-site Brainstorm personnel. In the course of 2021, 10 eligible patients that had completed the Phase 3 study, were enrolled in the EAP at the six participating medical centers to receive three additional doses of NurOwn eight weeks apart. Eight patients completed the program receiving all three treatment doses. Two participants withdrew consent after receiving two treatment doses. There were no serious adverse events AEs in the treated participants. On December 27, 2021, we announced plans for a dosing extension of NurOwn for participants who completed the EAP. The FDA recommended that Brainstorm submit an EAP protocol amendment to provide additional dosing for these participants. Under the original EAP protocol, participants who had completed the Phase 3 NurOwn trial and who met specific eligibility criteria had the opportunity to receive 3 doses of NurOwn . Under the amended EAP protocol, these eligible participants will receive up to 3 additional doses. Data collected from the original EAP treatments informed the decision to move forward with additional doses for participants who completed it. Seven participants completed treatment with NurOwn manufactured at the Catalent Houston manufacturing site and all follow-up visits. Patient Access Programs (ALS) The Company, had worked collaboratively with the Sourasky Hospital, to treat ALS patients with NurOwn , under the Israel Hospital Exemption HE regulatory pathway for Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products ATMP ), which was adopted by the Israeli MoH from the EMA regulation. Between the first quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company enrolled and treated 12 ALS patients with NurOwn , under the HE pathway. The Company received 3.4 million in gross proceeds in connection with the treatment of the aforementioned patients, which did not cover the costs of the trial. The remaining cost associated with the HE pathway were paid by Brainstorm. NurOwn in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PMS) On December 15, 2018, the FDA approved the Company s IND to conduct a Phase 2 open-label trial of repeated intrathecal administration of NurOwn in PMS (www.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT03799718). The study titled A Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated administration of NurOwn (Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells Secreting Neurotrophic Factors; MSC-NTF cells) in participants with PMS was designed to recruit 20 PMS participants at 5 leading U.S. Multiple Sclerosis centers. On December 18, 2019, the clinical trial independent Data Safety Monitoring Board DSMB for the U.S. Phase 2 PMS study completed the first, pre-specified interim analysis, of safety outcomes for the first 9 participants enrolled in the study. After careful review of all available clinical trial data, the DSMB unanimously concluded the study should continue as planned without any protocol modification . In August 2021, the clinical trial independent DSMB for the U.S. Phase 2 PMS study issued an end-of-study statement concluding that, based on the data, the procedures and treatment involved in BCT-101-US were relatively safe and tolerable. Given that the study was open-label with no active comparator arm(s), it was not possible to evaluate efficacy, except through comparison to non-contemporaneous natural history data sets or to prior clinical trials of similar populations.

 Phase 2 PMS Clinical Trial On March 24, 2021, the Company announced positive top-line data in the Phase 2 study evaluating three repeated administrations of NurOwn , each given 2 months apart, as a treatment for PMS. The 28-week open-label Phase 2 clinical trial enrolled 20 primary and secondary PMS patients based on the 2017 revised McDonald Criteria, ages 18-65, with baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale EDSS scores between 3-6.5, without evidence of relapse within 6 months of enrollment, able to walk 25 feet in 60 seconds or less and were permitted to be on a stable dose of disease modifying therapy. Of the 20 patients enrolled, 18 were treated and 16 (80) completed the study. Two patients discontinued related to procedure-related AEs. There were no study deaths or AEs related to multiple sclerosis MS worsening. The mean age of study patients was 47, 56 were female, and mean baseline EDSS score was 5.4. The clinical trial compared clinical efficacy outcomes with a 48-patient matched clinical cohort from the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigations in MS at the Brigham Woman s Hospital (CLIMB Study). MS Function and Cognition measures in the top-line results included the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW); 9-hole peg test (9-HPT); Low Contrast Letter Acuity (LCLA); Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT); and the 12 item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12). Key findings from the trial were as follows: Prespecified 25 improvements in the timed T25FW and 9-HPT (combined average) from baseline to 28 weeks were observed in 14 and 13 of NurOwn treated patients, respectively, and improvement in 9-HPT (combined average) was observed in 0 of the pre-specified matched historical controls in the CLIMB registry. 38 of NurOwn treated patients showed at least a 10-point improvement in the MSWS-12 from baseline to week 28, a patient reported outcome that evaluates walking function. 47 of NurOwn treated patients showed at least an 8-letter improvement across 28 weeks in the LCLA binocular 1.25 , a visual function test. Additionally, 27 of NurOwn treated patients showed at least an 8-letter improvement across 28 weeks in the LCLA binocular 2.5 , 67 of NurOwn treated patients showed at least a 3-point improvement in the SDMT, a measure of cognitive processing. NurOwn treated patients showed a mean improvement from baseline of 10 in T25FW and a 4.8 improvement from baseline on the 9-HPT dominant hand, compared to 1.8 and 1.4 worsening respectively in matched historical controls from the CLIMB registry. NurOwn treated patients showed a 6 improvement from baseline in MSWS-12. 
 All results reported are based on observed data. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were obtained at 3 consecutive time points, just prior to each intrathecal administration of NurOwn . We observed increases in neuroprotective molecules (VEGF, HGF) and decreases in neuroinflammatory biomarkers (MCP-1, and Osteopontin). Additionally, we completed secondary efficacy data and detailed CSF and blood biomarker analyses. We presented a detailed summary of the study outcomes at the 37th Congress of the ECTRIMS on October 14, 2021 and published our findings in the peer reviewed journal Multiple Sclerosis Journal in September 15, 2022. We are currently considering how best to advance NurOwn as an innovative treatment option in PMS. NurOwn in Alzheimer s Disease (AD) On June 24, 2020, we announced a new clinical program focused on the development of NurOwn as a treatment for AD. We are currently evaluating next steps based on emerging scientific insights and the changing regulatory landscape for AD following the recent FDA decision to grant accelerated approval of Aducanumab and pending regulatory reviews of other investigational anti-amyloid therapies.

Table of Contents 
 While many AD therapies have focused on a single target such as tau or beta-amyloid, we believe NurOwn has the capability to simultaneously target multiple relevant biological pathways and bring a comprehensive approach to this multifactorial disease. Importantly, NurOwn s mechanism of action may allow the therapy to enable synergistic combinations with anti-tau or anti-beta-amyloid treatments, further underscoring its potential to address critical unmet needs in AD. In such a complex disease, addressing inflammation and neuroprotection is an innovative approach and a first in the world for this technology. Non-Dilutive Funding In July 2017, we were awarded a grant in the amount of 15,912,390 from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to aid in funding the Company s pivotal Phase 3 study of NurOwn , for the treatment of ALS. We received 12,550,000 of the CIRM grant from 2017 2019: 9,050,000 from 2017 through 2018, and an additional 3,500,000 in 2019. On March 16, 2020, we received 2,200,000 from CIRM for achieving our pre-determined milestones. In July 2020, we received an additional 700,000 for making further progress in our Phase 3 study. On December 1, 2020, we received our final payment of 462,390. We have now received in full the total amount of the 15,912,390 grant funding awarded by CIRM. The grant does not bear a royalty payment commitment nor is the grant otherwise refundable. On November 14, 2019, we were awarded a 495,330 grant from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), through its Fast Forward program, for serum and CSF biomarkers analysis in Brainstorm s Phase 2 open-label, multicenter clinical trial of repeated intrathecal administration of NurOwn in participants with PMS. As of September 30, 2024, we have received 352,156 out of the 495,330 awarded. On June 9, 2020, we announced that The ALS Association and I AM ALS have awarded us a combined grant of 500,000 to support an ALS biomarker research study. The grant will be used to draw insights from data and samples collected from patients who participated in Brainstorm s Phase 3 clinical trial and treated with NurOwn , and to further the understanding of critical biomarkers associated with treatment response for people with ALS. As of September 30, 2024, we have received 400,000 out of 500,000 awarded. Intellectual Property A key element of our overall strategy is to establish a broad portfolio of patents and other methods described below to protect its proprietary technologies and products. Brainstorm is the sole licensee or assignee of 27 granted patents, and 23 patent applications in the United States, Canada, Europe, Israel and Brazil, as well as in additional countries worldwide, including countries in the Far East and South America (in calculating the number of granted patents and patent applications, each European patent validated in multiple jurisdictions was counted as a single patent).

 Stock Split On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the one-for-fifteen Reverse Stock Split of the Company s Common Stock, effective as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern time. The Reverse Stock Split had been approved by the Board on September 23, 2024 and by the Company s stockholders at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split, each fifteen shares of Common Stock of the Company were combined and were reclassified into one share of Common Stock of the Company, and the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company was proportionally reduced, in both cases without any change to the authorized number of shares of Common Stock or in the par value of such shares. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who were entitled to fractional shares received cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares at a rate of 4.2405 per share (the average of the closing trading prices of the Common Stock (as adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split) during regular trading hours for the five trading days immediately preceding the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split). The number of shares of the Company s Common Stock subject to outstanding options and warrants issued by the Company were reduced proportionately and the respective exercise prices were increased proportionately to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the Company s equity compensation plans were also reduced proportionately. Research and Development We are actively engaged in research and development to evaluate the potential for clinical development of NurOwn and MSC-NTF derived Exosomes in various neurodegenerative disorders, neurodegenerative eye disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS ). MSC-NTF derived Exosomes are an example of ongoing research in additional specialized derivative cell products. Exosomes are extracellular nano-vesicles (secreted by the cells) that carry various molecular components of their cell of origin, including nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Exosomes can transfer molecules from one cell to another, thereby mediating cell-to-cell communication, ultimately regulating many cell processes, which are suitable for clinical applications in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. NurOwn derived exosomes may possess unique features for the enhanced delivery of therapeutics to the brain, due to their ability to cross the blood brain barrier and to penetrate the brain and spinal cord. The exosome research efforts are primarily focused on manufacturing of MSC-NTF exosomes from bone marrow derived MSC: 1. Developing and optimizing large scale cell culture processes using bioreactors, to generate exosomes. 2. Developing advanced scalable purification GMP methods that can be applied to commercial use. 3. Quantification, characterization of phenotype and exosome cargo. 4. Assessment of MSC-NTF exosomes potency and stability. 5. Establishment of a method for exosomes modification. 6. Preclinical experiments in neurodegenerative and lung injury models. 
 NurOwn derived exosomes have the potential to treat ARDS due to their ability to penetrate deep tissues and decrease the inflammatory response. ARDS is a type of respiratory failure associated with widespread inflammation and lung damage mediated by dysregulated cytokine production and is one of the severe features of COVID-19. MSC exosomes may be delivered intravenously or directly into the lungs via intratracheal administration have several practical advantages over cellular therapy including ease of storage, stability, formulation and low immunogenicity.

 In a preclinical study, we evaluated MSCs and NurOwn derived exosomes in an LPS ARDS-mouse model, relevant to severe acute lung injury. The results from the study showed that intratracheal administration of NurOwn derived exosomes resulted in a statistically significant improvement in multiple lung parameters. These included the clinically relevant factors: functional lung recovery, reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and most importantly, attenuation of lung damage. Moreover, MSC-NTF cell derived exosomes exhibited a superior effect when compared to treatment with exosomes derived from na ve MSCs from the same donor. On January 20, 2021, we announced the peer-reviewed publication of this preclinical study in the journal Stem Cell and Research Therapy. The study, entitled MSC-NTF (NurOwn exosomes: a novel therapeutic modality in the mouse LPS-induced ARDS model, evaluated the use of NurOwn (MSC-NTF cell) derived exosomes in a mouse model of ARDS. On May 4, 2022, we made a presentation titled MSC-NTF derived small extracellular vesicles display superior macrophage immunomodulation compared with vesicles derived from na ve MSCs at the International Society of Cell Gene Therapy ISCT 2022 Meeting in San Francisco, CA May 4-7. The presentation highlighted results of a preclinical study undertaken to understand the mechanisms underlying the superior preclinical efficacy of Exo MSC-NTF versus Exo-MSC in acute lung injury models. On May 25, 2021, we made a scientific presentation of NurOwn Exosome preclinical ARDS data at the ISCT 2021 New Orleans Virtual Meeting demonstrating that intrathecal administration of NurOwn-derived exosomes resulted in statistically significant improvements in multiple lung parameters in a mouse model of ARDS. On May 26, 2022, we presented a poster titled Therapeutic effect of MSC-NTF exosomes in experimental bleomycin-induced lung injury at the ISEV 2022 Annual Meeting, Lyon France. Results from a preclinical study demonstrating superior outcomes of exosomes derived from MSC-NTF cells compared to exosomes derived from MSC cells were presented. A poster titled, Therapeutic Benefits of MSC-NTF (NurOwn Exosomes in Acute Lung Injury Models was presented on October 19, 2021 at the NYSCF 2021 Virtual Meeting, which was held on October 19-20, 2021. Results in two different acute lung injury models showed that the beneficial effects of intratracheal administration of Exo MSC-NTF (MSC-NTF derived exosomes) were more active than Exo MSC (MSC-derived Exosomes) in multiple parameters, including increase in blood oxygen saturation and reduction in lung pathology, inflammatory infiltration and levels of proinflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid BALF ), in addition to reduction of lung fibrosis in the Bleomycin model. The observed positive preclinical results suggest that intratracheal administration of Exo MSC-NTF may have clinical potential as a therapy for acute lung related pathologies and has the potential to modify physiological, pathological, and biochemical outcomes with greater activity than sEVs isolated from na ve MSCs. For the completed multidose clinical studies in ALS and PMS, the Company has improved the efficiency of NurOwn production and improved its stability, allowing manufacturing to take place at centralized clean room facilities from which NurOwn is distributed to the clinical trial sites, where the cells are then administered to patients. The Company is also engaged in several research initiatives to further improve and scale-up manufacturing capacity and extend the shelf life of NurOwn .

 Additional funding will be required to begin the commercialization efforts and to achieve a level of sales adequate to support the Company s cost structure. To meet its capital needs, the Company is considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional public and private sales of its Common Stock and warrants, the exercise of warrants, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, sales of Common Stock via its August 9, 2021 ATM program and other funding transactions. While the Company has been successful in raising financing recently and in the past, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. Management expects that the Company will continue to generate losses from the clinical development and regulatory activities, which will result in a negative cash flow from operating activity. The Company has completed regulatory review of the BLA for NurOwn for the treatment of ALS with the withdrawal of the BLA on November 3, 2023. The decision to withdraw the BLA was coordinated with FDA and is viewed by FDA as a withdrawal without prejudice. On November 20, 2023, we announced that the FDA granted the company a meeting to discuss the regulatory path forward for NurOwn in ALS. The meeting took place on December 6, 2023. On December 7, 2023, we announced the completion of a productive meeting with the FDA to discuss NurOwn . The primary objective of the meeting was to discuss plans for an SPA with FDA on the overall protocol design for a planned Phase 3b registrational trial for NurOwn . The ultimate goal of the SPA is to secure the FDA s agreement that critical elements of the overall protocol design (e.g., entry criteria, endpoints, planned analyses) are adequate and acceptable for a study intended to support a future marketing application. On February 23, 2024, we announced that we submitted the SPA request to the FDA for the planned Phase 3b clinical trial of NurOwn for the treatment of ALS. On April 9, 2024, the Company announced that it received written agreement from the FDA, under an SPA, on the design for a Phase 3b trial of NurOwn in ALS. The SPA agreement with the FDA validates the clinical trial protocol and statistical analysis of the planned Phase 3b trial of NurOwn, demonstrating the Company s adequacy in addressing objectives that support a future BLA in ALS. If the Company is not able to raise additional capital for these purposes, the Company may not be able to continue to function as a going concern. The Company s consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, the Company has financed its operations primarily through public and private sales of its Common Stock and warrants, the exercise of warrants, the issuance of convertible promissory notes, sales via the ATM programs and through various grants. On September 30, 2024 cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash amounted to 349,000. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8,045,000. Cash used for operating activities was primarily attributed to cost of clinical trials, rent of clean room and materials for clinical trials, payroll costs, rent, outside legal fee expenses and public relations expenses. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6,909,000 from sales of common stock under the August 9, 2021 ATM programs and June 2024 Sales of Unregistered Securities. On August 9, 2021, the Company entered into the New Distribution Agreement with the Agents pursuant to which the Company may sell from time to time, through the Agents, shares of Common Stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 100,000,000 (the August 9, 2021, ATM ). Sales under the August 9, 2021, ATM are to be made by any method permitted by law that is deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, sales made directly on the Nasdaq Capital Market, on any other existing trading market for the Shares, through a market maker or as otherwise agreed by the Company and the Agents. In connection with the New Distribution Agreement, the Company terminated the previous Distribution Agreement and the September 25, 2020, ATM. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has sold 637,543 shares of Common Stock for gross proceeds of approximately 3,342,413 under the August 9, 2021, ATM.

 Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities: On July 17, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the purchaser named therein, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, in the Offering, an aggregate of 270,270 shares of Common Stock, together with the Common Warrants to purchase 270,270 shares of Common Stock, at a purchase price of 27.75 per share and accompanying warrants for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately 7.5 million, before deducting fees payable to the placement agent and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Offering closed on July 19, 2023. The Common Warrants are immediately exercisable, expire five years following the date of issuance and have an exercise price of 30.00 per share. On June 27, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the purchaser, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, (i) an aggregate of 527,918 registered shares of the Company s common stock, (ii) the Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to 212,823 shares of Common Stock and (iii) unregistered warrants to purchase up to 1,111,111 shares of Common Stock, at a purchase price of 5.4 per share of Common Stock and accompanying Common Warrant, or 5.399 per Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying Common Warrant. The Offering of the Securities yielded gross proceeds to the Company of approximately 4.0 million, before deducting fees payable to the placement agent and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Offering closed on June 28, 2024. The Warrants will be exercisable six months after the issuance date, will expire five years following the date of issuance and have an exercise price of 5.868 per share. The Pre-Funded Warrant Shares are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of 0.00005 per share and will remain exercisable until the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. We expect that we will continue to generate losses from the clinical development and regulatory activities, which will result in a negative cash flow from operating activity. If we are granted an SPA with the FDA, additional capital raise will be needed to conduct a Phase 3b trial in ALS, to commercialize NurOwn for ALS, and for future trials that may be needed for other indications. The actual amount of cash that the Company will need to operate is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, design and conduct of clinical trials for our product candidates, along with cost to commercialize these product candidates. We anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional financing in the future to fund our operations. In order to meet these additional cash requirements, we may incur debt, license certain intellectual property, and seek to sell additional equity or convertible securities that may result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, these securities could have rights or preferences senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: our ability to obtain funding from third parties, including any future collaborative partners; the scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development programs; the time and costs required to gain regulatory approvals; the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish; the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patents, patent applications, patent claims, trademarks and other intellectual property rights; any product liability or other lawsuits related to our product candidates; the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; the general and administrative expenses related to being a public company;

 Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and disclosures requires us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Accounting for stock-based compensation: We grant equity-based awards under share-based compensation plans. We estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This fair value is then amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards. The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including price volatility of the underlying stock, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, and expected life of the option. Share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, and therefore is reduced by expected forfeitures. Changes in assumptions used under the Black-Scholes option valuation model could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. This information has been omitted as the Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, former Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that the information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II: OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of business, which we consider routine and incidental to our business. Between November 1, 2023 and April 12, 2024, five lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by purported shareholders of the Company. On November 1, 2023, a purported shareholder of the Company filed the Securities Complaint against the Company and certain of its officers, captioned Sporn v. Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc., et al. , Case No. 1:23-cv-09630, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Lead Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on April 1, 2024; the Amended Complaint adds a former officer as an individual defendant. The Amended Complaint in the Securities Action alleges violations of Sections 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against all defendants and control person violations of Section 20(a) against the individual defendants, relating to NurOwn for the treatment of ALS, the Company s submissions to and communications with the FDA in support of the approval of NurOwn for the treatment of ALS, and the prospects of future approval of NurOwn by the FDA. The Securities Action seeks, among other things, damages in connection with an allegedly inflated stock price between February 18, 2020 and September 27, 2023, as well as attorneys fees and costs. The Company and individual defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint on May 31, 2024; plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss on July 31, 2024; and the Company and individual defendants filed a reply in support of their motion to dismiss on September 17, 2024. The court may, in its discretion, either hold an oral argument or issue a ruling on the motion to dismiss based upon the parties briefing. On February 14, 2024, February 15, 2024, March 21, 2024 and April 12, 2024 four purported shareholders of the Company filed the Derivative Complaints against the Company as nominal defendant and certain of its officers, current and former directors, and members of its scientific advisory board, captioned Porteous v. Lebovits, et al. , Case No. 1:24-cv-01095; Andrev v. Lebovits, et al. , Case No. 1:24-cv-1101; and Holtzman v. Lebovits, et al. , Case No. 1:24-cv-02139, and Hamby v. Lebovits, et al. , Case No. 1:24-cv-02811 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On April 25, 2024, the Court consolidated the Derivative Actions into a consolidated action captioned In Re Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics, Inc. Derivative Litigation , Case No. 1:24-cv-01095-DEH (the Consolidated Derivative Action ), and appointed Co-Lead Counsel. All substantive deadlines in the Consolidated Derivative Action are currently stayed pending the court s decision on the motion to dismiss in the Securities Action. Plaintiffs have not yet filed a consolidated complaint; the Derivative Actions, brought on behalf of the Company, each assert state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment against the individual defendants. The complaints in Holtzman and Hamby also assert state law claims against the individual defendants for abuse of control, gross mismanagement, corporate waste, a claim against the individual defendants for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and a claim against two officer defendants for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act. The Derivative Complaints allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties and duties under the Exchange Act in connection with the Company s internal controls relating to, as with the allegations in the Securities Complaint, NurOwn for the treatment of ALS, the Company s submissions to and communications with the FDA in support of the approval of NurOwn for the treatment of ALS, and the prospects of future approval of NurOwn by the FDA their actions or omissions could not have been a good faith exercise of prudent business. The Derivative Actions seek among other things, monetary damages and disgorgement of performance-based compensation granted in connection with an allegedly inflated stock price between August 15, 2022 and September 27, 2023, as well as attorneys fees and costs. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the lawsuits. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Other than the additional risk factors below, there have not been any material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10 - K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 - Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10 - K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10 - K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 - Q, are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

 If we fail to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, our Common Stock may be delisted, and the price and liquidity of our common stock may be negatively impacted. On July 18, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff indicating that we have not maintained Nasdaq s MVLS of 35 million from June 2, 2024 to July 17, 2024. Under Nasdaq s listing rules, we have 180 calendar days from this notice, until January 14, 2025, to regain compliance with Nasdaq s MVLS. If at any time during this compliance period the Company s MVLS closes at 35 million or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, the Staff will notify the Company that it has regained compliance with the MVLS requirement. However, if the Company fails to comply with the MVLS requirement for ten consecutive business days prior to the expiration of the compliance period on January 14, 2025, then the Staff will send the Company a notice of delisting. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to regain compliance with the MVLS requirement, delisting from the Nasdaq market could make trading the Common Stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. In addition, without a Nasdaq market listing, stockholders may have difficulty obtaining a quote for the sale or purchase of the Common Stock, the sale or purchase of the Common Stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of the Common Stock could decline. Delisting from Nasdaq could also result in negative publicity, make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, result in potential loss of confidence by investors and employees, and result in fewer business development opportunities. We cannot assure you that the Common Stock, if delisted from Nasdaq, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter quotation system. We are and could be further subject to securities class action litigation and other types of stockholder litigation. The stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities. For example, in November 2023, a purported stockholder filed a lawsuit against us and certain of our officers captioned Sporn v. Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and in February 2024, March 2024, and April 2024, four derivative actions were filed in the same court, consolidated and captioned In Re Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics, Inc. Derivative Litigation (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a more detailed description of these matters). We could also be subject to other types of litigation, which may involve claims of breach of fiduciary duties by our directors or officers for misuse/mismanagement of company assets/resources or conflicts of interest. Any such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) , or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
