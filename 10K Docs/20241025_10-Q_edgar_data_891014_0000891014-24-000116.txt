 The effective tax rate was for the three-month period ended September 29, 2024, as compared with a tax benefit for the three-month period ended October 1, 2023 due to non-cash impairment of assets in the prior year. The effective tax rate was for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2024,

 period ended October 1, 2023. The higher tax rate for the current year was primarily due to the expected credit loss in connection with the
 Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement that the Company entered into with its subsidiary Oldco (see Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated
 Financial Statements). Such credit loss is not currently deductible as the loans under such agreement are treated as an equity contribution for tax purposes. The current expected credit loss may become fully deductible in a future period. The timing of

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

Minerals Technologies Inc.:

Results of Review of Interim Financial Information

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheet of Minerals Technologies Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 29, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for the three-month and nine-month
 periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the related condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the related condensed consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity for the three-month periods ended September 29, 2024, June 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, and October 1, 2023, July 2, 2023 and April 2, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the
 consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
 principles.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
 balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in
 shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 16, 2024, we expressed
 an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Basis for Review Results

This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB
 and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of
 applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the
 expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

27

As part of the Concept Pet acquisition, the Company assumed 1.9 million in long-term debt, recorded at fair value, consisting of two terms loans,
 one that matures in 2025 and one that matures in 2027. Both loans have annual payments and carry a variable interest rate. The Company repaid 0.1
 million on these loans during 2024.

As of September 29, 2024,
 the Company had 25.5 million in uncommitted short-term bank credit lines, of which none were in use. The credit lines are primarily outside the U.S. and are generally one year in term at competitive
 market rates at large, well-established institutions. The Company typically uses its available credit lines to fund working capital requirements or local capital spending needs. 

We anticipate that capital expenditures for 2024 should be about 90 million, principally related to opportunities to
 improve our operations and meet our strategic growth objectives. 

In the second quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a new floating to fixed interest rate swap for a notional amount of 150 million.
 The fair value of this instrument at September 29, 2024 is a liability of 0.9 million.

On October 18, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the Company s management to repurchase, at its discretion, up to 75
 million of the Company s shares over a one-year period. As of September 29, 2024, 990,510 shares have been repurchased under this program for 71.6 million, or an
 average price of approximately 72.30 per share. This program has been completed in October 2024.

On October 16, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company's management to repurchase, at its discretion, up to 200
 million of the Company's shares.

On October 16, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on its common stock of 0.11 per share. No
 dividend will be payable unless declared by the Board and unless funds are legally available for payment thereof.

The Company is required to make future payments under various contracts, including debt agreements and lease agreements. The Company also
 has commitments to fund its pension plans and provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, there were no material changes in the Company s contractual obligations.

The Company and certain of the Company s subsidiaries are
 among numerous defendants in over six hundred cases seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos-contaminated talc products sold by the Company s subsidiary Oldco. The Company s position is that these cases are meritless and all talc products
 sold by Oldco are safe. On October 2, 2023 (the Petition Date ), notwithstanding the Company s confidence in the safety of Oldco s talc products, the Chapter 11 Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
 Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the Chapter 11 Cases to address and comprehensively resolve Oldco s liabilities associated with talc. Minerals Technologies Inc. and the Company s other subsidiaries
 were not included in the Chapter 11 filing. In the second quarter of 2024, Oldco sold its talc assets under section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In
 addition, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement with Oldco (the "DIP Credit Agreement") and recorded a provision for credit loss of 30 million for the maximum principal amount under such DIP
 Credit Agreement. Proceeds of the sale of Oldco's talc assets, as well as the funds drawn by Oldco under the DIP Credit Agreement, will be used to fund the Chapter 11 Cases. 
 The Chapter 11 Debtors' ultimate goal in the Chapter 11 Cases is to confirm a plan of reorganization under Section 524(g) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and utilize this provision of the Bankruptcy Code to establish a trust that will address all current
 and future talc-related claims. In January 2024, the Chapter 11 Debtors and Minerals Technologies Inc. commenced a court-approved mediation process with the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (appointed in the Chapter 11 Cases as the
 representative of current talc claimants) and the Future Claimants Representative (appointed in the Chapter 11 Cases as the representative of future talc claimants) regarding the terms of a potential consensual plan of reorganization and the ultimate
 amount to be contributed to any trust. The mediation process is ongoing, and was recently extended through December 11, 2024 (subject to further extensions). During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company anticipates that the Chapter 11
 Debtors will benefit from the operation of the automatic stay, which stays ongoing litigation in connection with talc-related claims against Oldco. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the filing or continued prosecution of all talc-related
 claims against Oldco s non-debtor affiliates is temporarily stayed through December 11, 2024 (subject to further extensions), the date on which a hearing is scheduled on the status of the Chapter 11 Cases. The Chapter 11 Debtors have been
 deconsolidated from the Company s financial statements since the Petition Date. Although the Chapter 11 Cases are progressing, it is not possible to predict the form of any ultimate resolution or when an ultimate resolution might occur at this time.
 Accordingly, the amount that will be necessary to fully and finally resolve all of the Chapter 11 Debtors' current and future talc-related claims in connection with a confirmed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization cannot be estimated with certainty at
 this time. See Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated
 Financial Statements included in this report for more information.

Cautionary Statement for Safe Harbor Purposes under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the
 Company. This report contains statements that the Company believes may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, particularly statements relating to the Company s objectives, plans or
 goals, future actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenditures, and financial results. From time to time, the Company also provides forward-looking statements in other publicly-released materials,
 both written and oral. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations and forecasts of future events such as new products, revenues and financial performance, and are not limited to describing historical or current facts. They can be
 identified by the use of words such as outlook, forecast, believes, expects, plans, intends, anticipates, and other words and phrases of similar meaning.

Forward-looking statements are necessarily based on assumptions, estimates and limited information available at the time they are made. A
 broad variety of risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, as well as the inaccuracy of assumptions and estimates, can affect the realization of the expectations or forecasts in these statements. Many of these risks and uncertainties are
 difficult to predict or are beyond the Company s control. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may vary materially. Significant factors that could affect the expectations and forecasts include worldwide
 general economic, business, and industry conditions; the cyclicality of our customers businesses and their changing regional demands; our ability to compete in very competitive industries; consolidation in customer industries, principally paper,
 foundry and steel; our ability to renew or extend long term sales contracts for our satellite operations; our ability to generate cash to service our debt; our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our debt; our ability to
 effectively achieve and implement our growth initiatives or consummate the transactions described in the statements; our ability to successfully develop new products; our ability to defend our intellectual property; the increased risks of doing
 business abroad; the availability of raw materials and access to ore reserves at our mining operations, or increases in costs of raw materials, energy, or shipping; compliance with or changes to regulation in the areas of environmental, health and
 safety, and tax; risks and uncertainties related to the voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code filed by our subsidiaries BMI Oldco Inc. (f/k/a Barretts Minerals Inc.) and Barretts Ventures Texas LLC; claims for
 legal, environmental and tax matters or product stewardship issues; operating risks and capacity limitations affecting our production facilities; seasonality of some of our businesses; cybersecurity and other threats relating to our information
 technology systems; and other risk factors set forth under Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in Exhibit 99 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date
 hereof. Investors should refer to the Company s subsequent filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for further disclosures.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) are established by the Financial
 Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the form of accounting standards updates (ASUs) to the FASB s Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to
 be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which
 requires entities to report incremental information about significant segment expenses included in a segment s profit or loss measure, as well as the name and title of the chief operating decision maker. The guidance also requires interim disclosures
 related to reportable segment profit or loss and assets that had previously only been disclosed annually. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December
 15, 2023. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.

Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , that requires entities
 to disclose additional information about federal, state, and foreign income taxes primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The new standard also eliminates certain existing disclosure requirements related to
 uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial
 statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
 which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

29

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived
 assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, including valuation allowances and pension plan assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.

There have been no material changes to the critical
 accounting estimates that our accounting policies require us to make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as described in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes
 in market prices and foreign currency and interest rates. We are exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar. We do not anticipate that near-term changes in exchange rates will have a
 material impact on our future earnings or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant decline in the value of foreign currencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
 operations. A portion of our long-term bank debt bears interest at variable rates; therefore, our results of operations would be affected by interest rate changes to the extent of such outstanding bank debt. An immediate 10 percent change in interest
 rates would have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year. A one-percent change in interest rates, inclusive of the impact of our interest rate derivatives, would result in 4.4 million in incremental interest charges on
 an annual basis.

We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. When appropriate, we enter into
 derivative financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, hedges and interest rate swaps, to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our operating results. The counterparties are major financial
 institutions. Such forward exchange contracts, hedges and interest rate swaps would not subject us to additional risk from exchange rate or interest rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets,
 liabilities, and transactions being hedged.

In the second quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap for a notional amount of 150 million. The
 fair value of this instrument at September 29, 2024 is a liability of 0.9 million.

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, and under the supervision and with participation of the Company s management,
 including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b).
 Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 29, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 RISK FACTORS
 
 Our business faces significant risks. Set forth below are all risks that we believe are material at this time. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
 
 Industry and Market Risks 
 
 Worldwide general economic, business, and industry conditions may have an adverse effect on the Company s results.
 
 The Company s business and operating results are affected by worldwide and regional economic, business, and industry conditions. In recent years, we have experienced, among other things, declining consumer and business confidence, volatile raw material prices, instability in credit markets, high unemployment, fluctuating interest and exchange rates, and other challenges in the countries in which we operate. Uncertainty or a deterioration in the economic conditions affecting the businesses to which, or geographic areas in which, we sell products could reduce demand for our products and inflationary pressures may increase our costs. The Company s customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtaining financing. As discussed below, the industries we serve have in the past been adversely affected by the uncertain global economic climate due to the cyclical nature of their businesses. As a result, existing or potential customers may reduce or delay their growth and investments and their plans to purchase products, pursue inventory reduction measures, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers could experience similar conditions, which could affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to the Company. We may also experience pricing pressure on products and services, or be unsuccessful in passing along to our customers an increase in our raw materials costs or energy prices, which could decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. Adversity within capital markets may also impact the Company s results of operations by negatively affecting the amount of expense the Company records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Actuarial valuations used to calculate income or expense for the plans reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Such actuarial valuations may change based on changes in key economic indicators. Global economic markets remain uncertain, and there can be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the near future. Future weakness in the global economy could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
 
 A number of our customers businesses are cyclical or have changing regional demands. Our operations are subject to these trends, and we may not be able to mitigate these risks.
 
 A significant portion of the sales of the High-Temperature product line of our Engineered Solutions segment are derived from the metalcasting market. The metalcasting market is dependent upon the demand for castings for automobile components, farm and construction equipment, oil and gas production equipment, power generation turbine castings, and rail car components. Many of these types of equipment are sensitive to fluctuations in demand during periods of recession or difficult economic conditions. This product line also serves the steel industry. In recent years, global steel production has been volatile. These trends have affected and may continue to affect the demand for our Engineered Solutions segment s products and services. We expect steel consumption to be similar to 2023 levels.
 
 In the paper industry, which is served by the Specialty Additives product line of our Consumer Specialties segment, production levels for uncoated freesheet within North America and Europe, our two largest markets, are projected to continue to decrease. The reduced demand for premium writing paper products has resulted in closures and conversions of mills in both North America and Europe. We expect paper consumption to remain similar to prior year levels in both regions.
 
 The Environmental Infrastructure product line of our Engineered Solutions segment serves the commercial construction, infrastructure and oil gas markets. In addition, the Specialty Additives product line of our Consumer Specialties segment is affected by the domestic residential building and construction markets, as well as the automotive market.
 
 Demand for our products is subject to trends in these markets. During periods of economic slowdown, our customers often reduce their capital expenditure and defer or cancel pending projects. Such developments occur even amongst customers that are not experiencing financial difficulties. In addition, these trends could cause our customers to face liquidity issues or bankruptcy, which could deteriorate the aging of our accounts receivable, increase our bad debt exposure and possibly trigger impairment of assets or realignment of our businesses. The Company has taken steps to reduce its exposure to variations in its customers businesses, including by diversifying its portfolio of products and services through geographic expansion, growth in less cyclical consumer oriented markets, and by structuring most of its long-term satellite contracts to provide a degree of protection against declines in the quantity of product purchased, since the price per ton of our products generally rises as the number of tons purchased declines. In addition, many of our product lines lower our customers costs of production or increase their productivity, which should encourage them to use our products. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will mitigate the risks of our dependence on these industries. Continued weakness in the industries we serve has had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on sales of our products and our results of operations. A continued or renewed economic downturn in one or more of the industries or geographic regions that the Company serves, or in the worldwide economy, could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from historical and expected results.

The Company operates in very competitive industries, which could adversely affect our profitability.
 
 The Company has many competitors. Some of our principal competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have. Accordingly, these competitors may be better able to withstand economic downturns and changes in conditions within the industries in which we operate and may have significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do. We also face competition for some of our products from alternative products, and some of the competition we face comes from competitors in lower-cost production countries like China and India. As a result of the competitive environment in the markets in which we operate, we currently face and will continue to face pressure on the sales prices of our products from competitors, which could reduce profit margins.
 
 The Company s sales could be adversely affected by consolidation in customer industries.
 
 Several consolidations in the paper industry have taken place in recent years and such consolidation could continue in the future. These consolidations could result in partial or total closure of some paper mills where the Company operates satellite plants. Such closures would reduce the Company s sales, except to the extent that they resulted in shifting paper production and associated purchases of calcium carbonate to another location served by the Company. Similarly, consolidations have occurred in the foundry and steel industries. Such consolidations in the major industries we serve concentrate purchasing power in the hands of a smaller number of manufacturers, enabling them to increase pressure on suppliers, such as the Company. This increased pressure could have an adverse effect on the Company s results of operations in the future.
 
 The Company s sales could be adversely affected by our failure to renew or extend long-term sales contracts for our satellite operations.
 
 The Company s sales of calcium carbonate to paper customers are typically pursuant to long-term evergreen agreements, initially ten years in length, with paper mills where the Company operates satellite plants. Sales pursuant to these contracts represent a significant portion of our sales in the Specialty Additives product line of the Consumer Specialties segment. The terms of many of these agreements have been extended or renewed in the past, often in connection with an expansion of the satellite plant. However, failure of a number of the Company s customers to renew or extend existing agreements on terms as favorable to the Company as those currently in effect, or at all, could have a substantial adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, and could also result in impairment of the assets associated with the satellite plant.
 
 Financial Risks 
 
 Servicing the Company s debt will require a significant amount of cash. This could reduce the Company s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or fund capital expenditures or working capital needs. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.
 
 At September 29, 2024, the Company had 982.9 million aggregate principal amount of total indebtedness (consisting primarily of 525.9 million aggregate principal amount of loans under our term facility, 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes and 60.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility) and an additional 230.8 million of borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility (after giving effect to 9.2 million of outstanding letters of credit). Our outstanding indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash to make interest payments. Further, the interest rate on a significant portion of our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility is based on SOFR interest rates, which has resulted in and could continue to result in higher interest expense in the event of continued increases in interest rates. Our ability to pay interest on our debt and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend in part upon our future financial and operating performance and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make these payments. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations, we will have to pursue one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying capital or other expenditures, refinancing debt, selling assets, or raising equity capital. Further, the requirement to make significant interest payments may reduce the Company s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or fund capital expenditure or working capital needs and may increase the Company s vulnerability to adverse economic conditions.

The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain various covenants that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.
 
 The agreement governing our senior secured credit facility and the indenture that governs our 5.0 Senior Notes due 2028 contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock, prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt, issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities, make loans and investments, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, incur liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, we are required to comply with specific financial ratios, including a maximum net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, under which we are required to achieve specific financial results. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the applicable agreements. In the event of any default under our senior secured credit facility, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the credit agreement, together with accrued interest thereon, to be due and payable. In such an event, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient assets to pay debt then outstanding under the credit agreement, the indenture governing our notes, and any other agreements governing our debt. Any future refinancing of the senior secured credit facility is likely to contain similar restrictive covenants. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
 Technology, Development and Growth Risks 
 
 The Company s results could be adversely affected if it is unable to effectively achieve and implement its growth initiatives.
 
 Sales and income growth of the Company depends upon a number of uncertain events. Growth will depend in part on sales growth from our existing businesses and customers. The Company has a strategic growth initiative to increase penetration into geographic markets such as Brazil, India and China as well as other Asian and Eastern European countries. The Company also has a strategic growth initiative to increase penetration into consumer oriented markets such as pet litter, personal care, and oil purification. Our strategy also anticipates growth through future acquisitions. However, our ability to identify and consummate any future acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by the number of attractive acquisition targets, internal demands on our resources and our ability to obtain financing. Our success in integrating newly acquired businesses will depend upon our ability to retain key personnel, avoid diversion of management s attention from operational matters, and integrate general and administrative services. In addition, future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt, costs and contingent liabilities. Integration of acquired operations may take longer, or be more costly or disruptive to our business, than originally anticipated, and it is also possible that expected synergies from future acquisitions may not materialize. We also may incur costs and divert management attention with regard to potential acquisitions that are never consummated. Difficulties, delays or failure of any of these strategies could affect the future growth rate of the Company.

Delays or failures in new product development could adversely affect the Company s operations.
 
 The Company s future business success will depend in part upon its ability to maintain and enhance its technological capabilities, to respond to changing customer needs, and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis. The Company is engaged in a continuous effort to develop new products and processes in all of its product lines. Difficulties, delays or failures in the development, testing, production, marketing or sale of such new products could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from our expected results.
 
 The Company s ability to compete is dependent upon its ability to defend its intellectual property against inappropriate disclosure, theft and infringement.
 
 The Company s ability to compete is based in part upon proprietary knowledge, both patented and unpatented. The Company s ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on its ability to defend its intellectual property against inappropriate disclosure and theft as well as against infringement. In addition, development by the Company s competitors of new products or technologies that are more effective or less expensive than those the Company offers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.

The Company s operations could be impacted by the increased risks of doing business abroad.
 
 The Company does business in many areas internationally. Approximately 47 of our sales in 2023 were derived from outside the United States and we have significant production facilities which are located outside of the United States. We have in recent years expanded our operations in emerging markets, and we plan to continue to do so in the future, particularly in China, India, Brazil, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Some of our operations are located in areas that have experienced political or economic instability, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Brazil, Thailand, China and South Africa. As the Company expands its operations overseas, it faces increased risks of doing business abroad, including inflation, fluctuation in interest rates, changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, export and import restrictions, tariffs, nationalization, expropriation, limits on repatriation of funds, civil unrest, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors. Further, geopolitical and terrorism threats, including armed conflict among countries, could in the future affect our business overseas, including leading to, among other things, impairment of our or our customers ability to conduct operations, adverse impact to our employees, and a loss of our investment. While recent geopolitical conflicts, such as between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas, have not significantly affected our business, the broader consequences of geopolitical and terrorism threats, which may include sanctions that prohibit our ability to do business in specific countries, embargoes, supply chain disruptions, potential contractual breaches and litigation, regional instability and geopolitical shifts, cannot be predicted. We are also subject to increased risks of natural disasters, public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as COVID-19, and other catastrophic events in such countries. Many of these risks are beyond our control and can lead to sudden, and potentially prolonged, changes in demand for our products, difficulty in enforcing agreements, and losses in the realizability of our assets. Adverse developments in any of the areas in which we do business could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and expected results. In addition, a significant portion of our raw material purchases and sales outside the United States are denominated in foreign currencies, and liabilities for non-U.S. operating expenses and income taxes are denominated in local currencies. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows and fair values have been and, in the future, will be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. We cannot assure you that we will implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business.
 
 The Company s operations are dependent on the availability of raw materials and access to ore reserves at its mining operations. Increases in costs of raw materials, energy, or shipping could adversely affect our financial results.
 
 The Company depends in part on having an adequate supply of raw materials for its manufacturing operations, particularly lime and carbon dioxide for the production of PCC, and magnesia and alumina for its refractory operations. Purchase prices and availability of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials on a timely basis, on price and other terms, or at all. While most such raw materials are readily available, the Company has purchased approximately 54 of its magnesia requirements from sources in China over the past five years. The price and availability of magnesia have fluctuated in the past and they may fluctuate in the future. Price increases for certain other of our raw materials, including petrochemical products, as well as increases in energy prices, have also affected our business. Our production processes consume a significant amount of energy, primarily electricity, diesel fuel, natural gas and coal. We use diesel fuel to operate our mining and processing equipment and our freight costs are heavily dependent upon fuel prices and surcharges. Energy costs also affect the cost of raw materials. On a combined basis, these factors represent a large exposure to petrochemical and energy products which may be subject to significant price fluctuations. The contracts pursuant to which we construct and operate our satellite plants generally adjust pricing to reflect the pass-through of increases in costs resulting from inflation, including energy. However, there is a time lag before such price adjustments can be implemented. The Company and its customers will typically negotiate reasonable price adjustments in order to recover these escalating costs, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover increasing costs through such negotiations.
 
 The Company also depends on having adequate access to ore reserves of appropriate quality at its mining operations. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves including subjective judgments and determinations that are based on available geological, technical, contract and economic information. In addition, mining permits, leases and other rights are, or may be, required for certain of the Company s mining operations. Such permits, leases and other rights are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. Our ability to maintain such mining permits, leases and other rights has been, and may continue to be, affected by changes in laws, regulations and governmental actions, particularly in emerging markets such as Turkey and China. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain such mining permits, leases and other rights to the extent we currently maintain them or at all.
 
 The Company relies on shipping bulk cargos of bentonite from the United States, Turkey and China to customers, as well as our own subsidiaries, and we are sensitive to our ability to recover these shipping costs. In the last few years, bulk cargo shipping rates have been very volatile, and, to a lesser extent, the availability of bulk cargo containers has been suspect. If we cannot secure our container requirements or offset additional shipping costs with price increases to customers, our profitability could be impacted. We are also subject to other shipping risks. In particular, rail service interruptions have affected our ability to ship, and the availability of rail service, and our ability to recover increased rail costs, may be beyond our control. In addition, governmental restrictions can, and during the COVID-19 pandemic did, affect our ability to ship our products.

Operational Risks 
 
 The Company s subsidiaries, BMI Oldco Inc. (f/k/a Barretts Minerals Inc.) Oldco and Barretts Ventures Texas LLC (together with Oldco, the Chapter 11 Debtors ), have filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to address and comprehensively resolve Oldco s liabilities associated with talc. Risks and uncertainties related to this filing could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
 The Company and certain of the Company s subsidiaries are among numerous defendants in over six hundred cases seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos-contaminated talc products sold by the Company s subsidiary Oldco. On October 2, 2023 (the Petition Date ), notwithstanding the Company s confidence in the safety of Oldco s talc products, the Chapter 11 Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the Chapter 11 Cases to address and comprehensively resolve Oldco s liabilities associated with talc. Minerals Technologies Inc. and the Company s other subsidiaries were not included in the Chapter 11 filing. In the second quarter of 2024, Oldco sold its talc assets under section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In addition, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement with Oldco (the "DIP Credit Agreement") and recorded a provision for credit loss of 30 million for the maximum aggregate principal amount under such DIP Credit Agreement. Proceeds of the sale of Oldco's talc assets and funds drawn by Oldco under the DIP Credit Agreement will be used to fund the Chapter 11 Cases. The Chapter 11 Debtors' ultimate goal in the Chapter 11 Cases is to confirm a plan of reorganization under Section 524(g) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and utilize this provision of the Bankruptcy Code to establish a trust that will address all current and future talc-related claims. In January 2024, the Chapter 11 Debtors and Minerals Technologies Inc. commenced a court-approved mediation process with the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (appointed in the Chapter 11 Cases as the representative of current talc claimants) (the Committee and the Future Claimants Representative (appointed in the Chapter 11 Cases as the representative of future talc claimants) regarding the terms of a potential consensual plan of reorganization and the ultimate amount to be contributed to any trust. The mediation process is ongoing, and was recently extended through December 11, 2024 (subject to further extensions). During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company anticipates that the Chapter 11 Debtors will benefit from the operation of the automatic stay, which stays ongoing litigation in connection with talc-related claims against the Chapter 11 Debtors. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the filing or continued prosecution of all talc-related claims against the Chapter 11 Debtors' non-debtor affiliates is temporarily stayed through December 11, 2024 (subject to further extensions), the date on which a hearing is scheduled on the status of the Chapter 11 Cases. The Chapter 11 Debtors have been deconsolidated from the Company s financial statements since the Petition Date. 
 
 Although the Chapter 11 Cases are progressing, it is not possible at this time to predict how the Bankruptcy Court will rule on the Committee s motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 Cases, the form of any ultimate resolution or when an ultimate resolution might occur. Accordingly, the amount that will be necessary to fully and finally resolve all of Oldco s current and future talc-related claims in connection with a confirmed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization cannot be estimated at this time. Several risks and uncertainties related to the Chapter 11 Cases could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including the value of the Chapter 11 Debtors , as deconsolidated, reflected in the Company s financial statements, the ultimate amount necessary to be contributed to any trust established pursuant to Section 524(g) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the potential for the Company s talc-related exposure to extend beyond the Chapter 11 Debtors arising from claims by talc plaintiffs relating to the Company s liability for talc claims, corporate veil piercing efforts or otherwise, any final resolution of the scope of the Pfizer indemnity, the costs of the Chapter 11 Cases and the length of time necessary to resolve the cases, either through settlement or as a result of litigation arising in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, and the possibility that the Chapter 11 Debtors will be unsuccessful in attaining relief under Chapter 11. Further, while the Company anticipates that the Chapter 11 Debtors will benefit from the operation of the automatic stay during the Chapter 11 proceedings, depending on the ultimate outcome of any of these litigation matters, the Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments, potentially in excess of liabilities accrued to date in respect of such matters. The resolution of, or recognition of additional liabilities in connection with, pending or future litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
 
 For a further discussion of the Chapter 11 Cases and Oldco's talc-related liabilities, see Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report.
 
 The Company is subject to stringent regulation in the areas of environmental, health and safety, and tax, and may incur unanticipated costs or liabilities arising out of claims for various legal, environmental and tax matters or product stewardship issues that could materially harm the Company s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
 
 The Company s operations are subject to international, federal, state and local governmental environmental, health and safety, tax and other laws and regulations. We have expended, and may be required to expend in the future, substantial funds for compliance with such laws and regulations. In addition, future events, such as changes to or modifications of interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or enforcement polices, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of operations or health hazards of certain products, may affect our mining rights or give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Further, certain of our customers are subject to various federal and international laws and regulations relating to environmental and health and safety matters, especially customers of our Environmental Infrastructure product line of our Engineered Solutions segment, who are subject to drilling permits, waste water disposal and other regulations. To the extent that these laws and regulations affecting our customers change, demand for our products and services could also change and thereby affect our financial results. State, national, and international governments and agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and regulation that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business, and some such legislation and regulation have already been enacted or adopted. Enactment of climate-related legislation or adoption of regulation that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business could have an adverse effect on our operations or demand for our products. Our manufacturing processes for our products use a significant amount of energy and, should energy prices increase as a result of such legislation or regulation, we may not be able to pass these increased costs on to purchasers of our products. We cannot predict if or when currently proposed or additional laws and regulations regarding climate change or other environmental or health and safety concerns will be enacted or adopted.

The Company is also subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax treaties, laws and regulations.
 
 The Company is currently a party in various litigation matters and tax and environmental proceedings and faces risks arising from various unasserted litigation matters, including product liability, patent infringement, antitrust claims, and claims for third-party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged torts, including, as discussed elsewhere in this Report, a number of cases seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos-contaminated talc products sold by the Company s subsidiary Barretts Minerals Inc. Any failure to appropriately manage safety, human health, product liability and environmental risks associated with the Company s products and production processes could adversely impact the Company s employees and other stakeholders, the Company s reputation, and its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Public perception of the risks associated with the Company s products and production processes could impact product acceptance and influence the regulatory environment in which the Company operates. Any unanticipated liability arising out of a current matter or proceeding, or from the other risks described above, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
 
 Production facilities are subject to operating risks and capacity limitations that may adversely affect the Company s financial condition or results of operations.
 
 The Company is dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities. Production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacturing, handling, storage, and transportation of chemical materials and products, including pipeline leaks and ruptures, explosions, fires, inclement weather and natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, and environmental risks. Production facilities are also subject to governmental requirements that may, and during the Covid-19 pandemic did, affect our ability to operate. We maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies. Further, from time to time, we may experience capacity limitations in our manufacturing operations. In addition, if we are unable to effectively forecast our customers demand, it could affect our ability to successfully manage operating capacity limitations. These hazards, limitations, disruptions in supply and capacity constraints could adversely affect financial results.
 
 Operating results for some of our businesses are seasonal.
 
 Certain of our businesses are affected by seasonal weather patterns. A majority of revenues from our energy services business within the Environmental Infrastructure product line of our Engineered Solutions segment is derived from the Gulf of Mexico and surrounding states, which are susceptible to hurricanes that typically occur June 1 st through November 30 th . Actual or threatened hurricanes can result in volatile demand for services provided by our energy services business. Our other businesses within the Environmental Infrastructure product line are affected by weather patterns which determine the feasibility of construction activities. Typically, less construction activity occurs in winter months and thus this segment s revenues tend to be greatest in the second and third quarters when weather patterns in our geographic markets are more conducive to construction activities. Additionally, some of the businesses within the Specialty Additives product line of our Consumer Specialties segment are subject to similar seasonal patterns.
 
 Our operations have been and will continue to be subject to cyber-attacks and other disruptions to our information systems that could have a material adverse impact on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
 
 Our operations are dependent on digital technologies and services. We use these technologies for activities important to our business, including managing and operating our manufacturing facilities, communications within our company and with customers and suppliers, maintaining accurate financial records, protecting confidential information, complying with regulatory, financial reporting, and legal requirements, and otherwise storing, processing and transmitting our data. Increased use of remote working arrangements has only increased our reliance on these technologies and services. Our business has in the past and could in the future be negatively affected by security incidents and systems disruptions. These disruptions or incidents may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, network or power outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, the unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, natural disasters, fires or other catastrophic events.
 
 Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, the techniques used to gain access to information technology systems and data, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated in nature and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. Cyberattacks and cyber incidents may be difficult to detect for periods of time and take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, introduction of viruses or malware (such as ransomware), exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources and business email compromise. Continued geopolitical instability has heightened the risk of cyberattacks.

Like other global companies, our systems are subject to recurring attempts by third parties to access information, manipulate data or disrupt our operations, and we have experienced cyber incidents. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue building and maintaining our information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, our business has been and can continue to be adversely affected by, among other things: interruption of our business operations; loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information, or customer, supplier, or employee data; and increased costs required to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. Similar risks exist with respect to our business partners and third-party providers that we rely upon. We are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our business partners and third-party providers can adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information. 
 
 Although the cyber incidents that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. While we believe we devote significant resources to network security, disaster recovery, employee training and other measures to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data, there can be no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all cyber incidents, systems disruptions, or misuses of data. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.
