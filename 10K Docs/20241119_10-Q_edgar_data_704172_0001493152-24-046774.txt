Update
No. 2018-07 June 2018 

Compensation
 Stock Compensation (Topic 718) 

Improvements
to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting 

Main
Provisions: The amendments in this Update expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods
and services from nonemployees. An entity should apply the requirements of Topic 718 to nonemployee awards except for specific guidance
on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost (that is, the period of time over which share-based payment awards vest
and the pattern of cost recognition over that period). The amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions
in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor s own operations by issuing share-based payment
awards. The amendments also clarify that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to
the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under
Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 

The
amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within that fiscal year. 

Update
No. 2017-13 - September 2017 

Revenue
Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) 

FASB
Accounting Standards Updates No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), issued in May 2014 and codified in ASC Topic
606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and No. 2016-02. 

The
transition provisions in ASC Topic 606 require that a public business entity and certain other specified entities adopt ASC Topic 606
for annual reporting 3 periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. FN2
All other entities are required to adopt ASC Topic 606 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting
periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. 

Update
No. 2016-10 - April 2016 

Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing 

The
core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: 

1.
Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 

 2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 

 3.
Determine the transaction price. 

 4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 

 5.
Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

The
amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify
the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining
the related principles for those areas. 

The
Company has either evaluated or is currently evaluating the implications, if any, of each of these pronouncements and the possible impact
they may have on the Company s financial statements. In most cases, management has determined that the implementation of these
pronouncements would not have a material impact on the financial statements taken as a whole.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE ASIA DIAMOND EXCHANGE AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CENTER IN VIETNAM 

Along
with the establishment of Philux Global Funds, the Company has worked with the Authority of Chu Lai Open Economic Zone in Central Vietnam
and the Provinces of Quang Nam and Dong Nai, Vietnam in the past to develop the Asia Diamond Exchange for lab-grown, rough and polished
diamond together with a multi-commodities logistics center. 

Mr.
Ben Smet, who successfully established the Dubai Diamond Exchange in 2002-2005, has been leading fulltime a group of experts for the
setup of the Asian Diamond Exchange since January 2018. He has brought together main trading players in the rough diamond industry to
come to Vietnam. He has also established a partnership with the biggest player in the rough trading and polishing business and engaged
other main international diamond trading groups to join the overall venture. 

The
Company has taken the decision to move the greater part of the ADE rough and polishing venture, first to an Industrial Zone to be established
close to the new international Airport in Long Thanh District, Dong Nai Province, Vietnam and is currently aiming for the Thanh Da Peninsula
in conjunction with the contemplated International Financial Center. This location change has caused that the entire KPC Process and
administration had to be adapted and redone with renewed financial input, mostly carried by Mr. Smet. 

Once
the Company has effectuated all budgeting and all financial requirements and obligations, the ongoing process will effectively materialize
and Mr. Smet then shall transfer the entire venture to Philux Global Group, Inc.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The
Company s financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations
of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also
affect supplemental information contained in the external disclosures of the Company including information regarding contingencies, risk
and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and
conservatively applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed by us for reasonableness and conservatism on a consistent basis throughout
the Company. Primary areas where financial information of the Company is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions and the application
of judgment include acquisitions, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, recoverability of deferred tax and the valuation of
shares issued for services. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

6 

Valuation
of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets 

The
recoverability of long-lived assets requires considerable judgment and is evaluated on an annual basis or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. As it relates to definite life intangible assets, we apply the impairment rules
as required by SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Assets to Be Disposed Of as amended
by SFAS No. 144, which also requires significant judgment and assumptions related to the expected future cash flows attributable to the
intangible asset. The impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and, thus,
the recoverability of the asset. 

Income
Taxes 

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases
of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon
historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. As of
September 30, 2023, we estimated the allowance on net deferred tax assets to be one hundred percent of the net deferred tax assets. 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

The
following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, our
financial condition on September 30, 2023 and factors that we believe could affect our future financial condition and results of operations.
Historical results may not be indicative of future performance. 

This
discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere
in this Form 10-Q. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in
the United States GAAP ). All references to dollar amounts in this section are in United States dollars.

TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK 

In
the course of its business, the Company has obtained short-term loans from individuals and institutional investors, including merchant
cash advances, and from time to time raised money by issuing restricted common stock of the Company under the auspices of Rule 144. These
notes bear interest rates ranging from 0 to 36 per annum. 

CONVERTIBLE
PROMISSORY NOTES 

The
Company has also from time to time issued convertible promissory notes to various private investment funds for short-term working capital
and special projects. Typically these notes bear interest rates from 5 to 12 per annum, mature within one year, are convertible to
common stock of the Company at a discount ranging from 42 to 50 , and may be repaid within 180 days at a prepayment premium ranging
from 130 to 150 .

COMPANY S
PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE FOLLOWING 12 MONTHS 

In
the next twelve months the Company s goals are to close the pending agreements for loan financing, asset management, partnership,
joint venture, and memorandum of understanding with international investor groups as mentioned above, advance the Philux Global Select
Growth Fund under Philux Global Funds SCA, SICAV-RAIF, develop the Asia Diamond Exchange in Vietnam in conjunction with International
Financial Center, commercialize the geomagnetic energy technologies, implement the business cooperation agreement with Saphia Alkali
JSC, as well as consummate and integrate some acquisitions and invest in targets that should add critical mass to the Company. In addition,
the Company will continue to carry out its merger and acquisition program by acquiring target companies for a roll-up strategy and also
invest in special situations. We will also continue to provide advisory and consulting services to international clients through our
subsidiaries Philux Global Advisors, Inc. and Philux Capital Advisors, Inc. 

MATERIAL
CASH REQUIREMENTS: We must raise substantial amounts of capital to fulfill our plans for investment in the Asian Diamond Exchange, the
International Financial Center, the geomagnetic energy technology, and for acquisitions. Besides the financing agreements mentioned above,
we intend to use equity, debt and project financing to meet our capital needs for acquisitions and investments as needed. 

Management
has taken action and formulated plans to meet the Company s operating needs through June 30, 2025 and beyond. The working capital
cash requirements for the next 12 months are expected to be generated from management fees, operations, sale of marketable securities
and additional financing. The Company plans to generate revenues from its consulting services, merger and acquisition advisory services,
and acquisitions of target companies with cash flows. 

AVAILABLE
FUTURE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS: The Company may use various sources of funds, including investment management agreements, short-term loans,
long-term debt, equity capital, and project financing as may be necessary. The Company believes it will be able to secure the required
capital to implement its business plan. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The
following discussion about PHI Group Inc. s market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements. 

Currency
Fluctuations and Foreign Currency Risk 

Some
of our operations are conducted in other countries whose official currencies are not U.S. dollars. However, the effect of the fluctuations
of exchange rates is considered minimal to our business operations. 

Interest
Rate Risk 

We
do not have significant interest rate risk, as most of our debt obligations are primarily short-term in nature to individuals, with fixed
interest rates. 

Valuation
of Securities Risk 

Since
a part of our assets is in the form of marketable securities, the value of our assets may fluctuate significantly depending on the market
value of the securities we hold.

ITEM
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management carried
out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls
and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon their evaluation,
our management (including our Chief Executive Officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
September 30, 2024, based on the material weaknesses defined below. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Management s
Report on Internal Control of Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is a set of processes designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal
financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 

- 
 pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets, 

- 
 provide
 reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance
 with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors,
 and 

- 
 provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of authorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could
 have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that
any system of internal control, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the system will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
the Company s management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September
30, 2023 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: 

(i) 
 inadequate
 segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; 

(ii) 
 ineffective
 controls over period-end financial disclosure and reporting processes. 

If
we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report
our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company. 

Based
on this assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September
30, 2024. 

10 

Management s
Remediation Plan 

We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this
quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses,
we plan to implement the following changes in the future: 

(i) 
 appoint
 additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and 

(ii) 
 adopt
 sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. 

The
remediation efforts set out in (i) are largely dependent upon our company securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing
the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. 

Management
believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our consolidated financial statements for the quarterly report ended September
30, 2024 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with US GAAP. 

Attestation
Report of the Registered Accounting Firm 

This
Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm pursuant to Rule 308(b) of Regulation S-K, which permits the Company to provide only management s
report in this Quarterly Report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No
changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting have come to management s attention during the fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Except
for some merchant cash advance cases that we intend to settle, the Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings and,
to the best of its knowledge, no such action by or against Company has been threatened. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Investment
in our securities is subject to various risks, including risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. The following sets forth factors
related to our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance or cash flows which could cause an investment
in our securities to decline and result in a loss. 

General
Risks Related to Our Business 

Our
success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations. 

Our
future success will depend in substantial part on the continued service of our senior management and certain external experts. The loss
of the services of one or more of our key personnel and/or outside experts could impede implementation and execution of our business
strategy and result in the failure to reach our goals. We do not carry key person life insurance for any of our officers or employees.
Our future success will also depend on the continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse
areas required for continuing our operations. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we will be able
to attract, train or retain qualified personnel in the future. 

11 

Risks
Related to Mergers and Acquisitions 

Our
strategy in mergers and acquisitions involves a number of risks and we have a limited history of successful acquisitions. Even when an
acquisition is completed, we may have to continue our service for integration that may not produce results as positive as management
may have projected. 

The
Company continues evaluating various opportunities and negotiating to acquire other companies, assets and technologies. Acquisitions
entail numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products, diversion of management s
attention from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.
We have limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations into our operations. Although potential synergy may be achieved by
acquisitions of related technologies and businesses, no assurance can be given as to the Company s ability to successfully integrate
any operations, personnel, services or products that have been acquired or might be acquired in the future. Failure to successfully assimilate
acquired organizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and operating results. 

Acquisitions
involve a number of special risks, including: 

failure
 of the acquired business to achieve expected results; 

diversion
 of management s attention; 

failure
 to retain key personnel of the acquired business; 

additional
 financing, if necessary and available, could increase leverage, dilute equity, or both; 

the
 potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles; and 

the
 high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities. 

These
risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition since the values of the securities
received for the consulting service at the execution of the acquisition depend on the success of the company involved in acquisition.
In addition, our ability to further expand our operations through acquisitions may be dependent on our ability to obtain sufficient working
capital, either through cash flows generated through operations or financing activities or both. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. 

Risks
associated with private equity (PE) funds 

There
are, broadly, five key risks to private equity investing: 

1.
 Operational risk: The risk of loss resulting from inadequate processes and systems supporting the organization. It is a
key consideration for investors regardless of the asset classes that funds invest into. 

2.
 Funding risk: This is the risk that investors are not able to provide their capital commitments and is effectively the
 investor default risk . PE funds typically do not call upon all the committed investor capital and only draw capital once
they have identified investments. Funding risk is closely related to liquidity risk, as when investors are faced with a funding shortfall,
they may be forced to sell illiquid assets to meet their commitments. 

3.
 Liquidity risk: This refers to an investor s inability to redeem their investment at any given time. PE investors
are locked-in for between five and ten years, or more, and are unable to redeem their committed capital on request during
that period. Additionally, given the lack of an active market for the underlying investments, it is difficult to estimate when the investment
can be realized and at what valuation. 

12 

4.
 Market risk: There are many forms of market risk affecting PE investments, such as broad equity market exposure, geographical/sector
exposure, foreign exchange, commodity prices, and interest rates. Unlike in public markets where prices fluctuate constantly and are
marked-to-market, PE investments are subject to infrequent valuations and are typically valued quarterly and with some element of subjectivity
inherent in the assessment. However, the market prices of publicly listed equities at the time of sale of a portfolio company will ultimately
impact realization value. 

5.
 Capital risk: The capital at risk is equal to the net asset value of the unrealized portfolio plus the future undrawn commitments.
In theory, there is a risk that all portfolio companies could experience a decline in their current value, and in the worst-case drop
to a valuation of zero. Capital risk is closely related to market risk. Whilst market risk is the uncertainty associated with unrealized
gains or losses, capital risk is the possibility of having a realized loss of the original capital at the end of a fund s life. 

There
are two main ways that capital risk brings itself to bear - through the failure of underlying companies within the PE portfolio and suppressed
equity prices which make exits less attractive. The former is impacted by the quality of the fund manager, i.e. their ability to select
portfolio companies with good growth prospects and to create value, hence why fund manager selection is key for investors. The condition,
method, and timing of the exit are all factors that can affect how value can be created for investors. 

Risks
Associated with Building and Operating a Diamond Exchange 

Fundamentally,
the key requirements for a successful diamond exchange include the following: 

1.
 Supply : One of the most important things for a successful trading hub is the ability to secure ample, stable, and sustainable
supply of commodities. In the case of a diamond exchange, adequate supply of rough diamond must be secured to make it successful. 

2.
 Capital : Besides the infrastructure, facilities, systems, and amenities to operate the diamond exchange, the organizers
must be able to arrange very large amounts of capital to facilitate the trade and other business activities related to the exchange. 

3.
 Participants : The organizers must be able to attract a large number of international diamonteers to participate in the
exchange. There is no guarantee that people will come when the exchange is built. 

4.
 Venue: The venue must be able to provide competitive advantages compared with existing diamond exchanges in the world in
terms of (a) modern facilities, latest technologies and state-of-the-art provisions, (b) tax relief, (c) financial facilitating network
from big investors, (d) retail banking, lending institutions and foreign exchange facilities, (e) licenses and registrations, (f) global
multi-commodities trading flatform, and (g) other amenities. 

Risks
Associated with International Markets 

As
some of our business activities are currently involved with international markets, any adverse change to the economy or business environment
in these countries could significantly affect our operations, which would lead to lower revenues and reduced profitability . 

Some
of our business activities are currently involved with non-US countries. Because of this presence in specific geographic locations, we
are susceptible to fluctuations in our business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in this region, including stock market
fluctuation. A stagnant or depressed economy in these countries generally, or in any of the other markets that we serve, could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

13 

Risks
Related to Our Securities 

Insiders
have substantial control over the company, and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control, even if our other stockholders
wanted such a change to occur. 

Though
our executive officers and directors as of the date of this report, in the aggregate, only hold a small portion of our outstanding common
stock, we have the majority voting rights associated with the Company s Class B Series I Preferred Stock, which decision may allow
the Board of Directors to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors
and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us even
if our other stockholders wanted it to occur. 

The
price at which investors purchase our common stock may not be indicative of the prevailing market price. 

The
stock market often experiences significant price fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies
whose stock is traded. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our shares. Investors may be unable to sell
their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses. 

Since
we do not currently meet the requirements for our stock to be quoted on NASDAQ, NYSE MKT LLC or any other senior exchange, the tradability
in our securities will be limited under the penny stock regulations. 

Under
the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the price of our securities on the OTCQB or OTC Markets is below 5.00 per share,
our securities are within the definition of a penny stock. As a result, it is possible that our securities may be subject
to the penny stock rules and regulations. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required
to comply with the Commission s regulations concerning the transfer of penny stock. These regulations require broker-dealers to: 

Make
a suitability determination prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser; 

 Receive
the purchaser s written consent to the transaction; and 

 Provide
certain written disclosures to the purchaser. 

These
requirements may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may affect the ability to resell our securities. 

Our
compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us. 

It
may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance staff in order to develop
and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with the internal controls requirements
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires
publicly traded companies to obtain.
