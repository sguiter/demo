The Company is currently exposed to volatility in short-term interest rates and has mitigated certain portions of that risk by using an interest rate swap.

At September 30, 2024 , the Company held an interest rate swap contract with a notional value of that was designated as a cash flow hedge. Period-to-period changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are initially recognized as gains or losses in other comprehensive income. As the interest rate swap contract is settled, the corresponding gain or loss is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) into earnings. The maturity date of the current interest swap contract is , which is closely aligned with the , maturity of the Company's revolving credit facility. The fair values of the derivative instruments held by the Company on September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, are disclosed in Note 3, Fair Value Measurements , of the notes to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements (included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).

 to . Within the range of possible environmental losses and legal losses, management has currently concluded that no single amount is more likely to occur than any other amounts in the range and, thus, has accrued at the lower end of the range. These accruals totaled at September 30, 2024 , and at December 31, 2023. A lthough the Company believes that its estimated range of possible environmental losses and legal losses and its reserves are adequate for contingencies, it is possible, due to uncertainties including those noted above, that additional reserves could be required in the future.

The Company has a rabbi trust to fund the obligations of its non-qualified supplemental executive defined contribution plans (supplemental plans). The trust is comprised of various mutual fund investments selected by the participants of the supplemental plans. In accordance with the accounting guidance for rabbi trust arrangements, the assets of the trust and the obligations of the supplemental plans are reported on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company elected the fair value option for the mutual fund investment assets so that offsetting changes in the mutual fund values and defined contribution plan obligations would be recorded in earnings in the same period. Therefore, the mutual funds are reported at fair value with any subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of income. The liabilities related to the supplemental plans increase (i.e., supplemental plan expense is recognized) when the value of the trust assets appreciate and decrease when the value of the trust assets decline (i.e., supplemental plan income is recognized). At September 30, 2024 , the balance of the trust assets was , which equaled the balance of the supplemental plan liabilities. See the long-term investments section in Note 3, Fair Value Measurements , of the notes to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements (included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further information regarding the Company s mutual fund assets.

Although the OECD s model provides a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar Two rules that vary slightly from the model, can adopt a different timeline, and may adjust local tax incentives in response to Pillar Two. While it is uncertain whether the U.S. will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, certain countries in which the Company operates have enacted such legislation, and other countries are in the process of

Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following is management s discussion and analysis (MD A) of certain significant factors that have affected the Company s financial condition and results of operations during the interim periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other than purely historical information, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). These statements include statements about Stepan Company s and its subsidiaries (the Company) plans, objectives, strategies, financial performance and outlook, trends, the amount and timing of future cash distributions, prospects or future events and involve known and unknown risks that are difficult to predict. As a result, the Company s actual financial results, performance, achievements or prospects may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as may, could, expect, intend, plan, seek, anticipate, believe, estimate, guidance, predict, potential, continue, likely, will, would, should, illustrative and variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the Company and its management based on their knowledge and understanding of the business and industry, are inherently uncertain. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and stockholders should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. There are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors, many of which are beyond the Company s control, that could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Such risks, uncertainties and other important factors, include, among others, the risks, uncertainties and factors set forth under Part II-Item IA - Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and under Part I-Item IA. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the risks and uncertainties related to the following: 
 accidents, unplanned production shutdowns or disruptions in any of the Company s manufacturing facilities; 

reduced demand for Company products due to customer product reformulations or new technologies; 

the Company s inability to successfully develop or introduce new products; 

compliance with environmental, health and safety, product registration and anti-corruption laws; 

the Company s ability to make acquisitions of suitable candidates and successfully integrate acquisitions; 

global competition and the Company s ability to successfully compete; 

volatility of raw material, natural gas and electricity costs as well as any disruption in their supply; 

disruptions in transportation or significant changes in transportation costs; 

downturns in certain industries and general economic downturns; 

international business risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, legal restrictions and taxes; 

unfavorable resolution of litigation against the Company; 

the Company s ability to keep and protect its intellectual property rights; 

potentially adverse tax consequences due to the international scope of the Company s operations; 

downgrades to the Company s credit ratings or disruptions to the Company s ability to access well-functioning capital markets; 

conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks and general instability, particularly in certain energy-producing nations, along with increased security regulations; 

cost overruns, delays and miscalculations in capacity needs with respect to the Company s expansion or other capital projects; 

interruption of, damage to or compromise of the Company s IT systems and failure to maintain the integrity of customer, colleague or Company data; 

the Company s ability to retain its executive management and other key personnel; 

the Company s ability to operate within the limitations of debt covenants; and 

the other factors set forth under Risk Factors. 

22 

These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause the Company s actual financial results, performance, achievements or prospects to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any of its forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also impact the Company s results. All forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or persons acting on the Company s behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth above. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake or assume any obligation to update publicly any of these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, new information or future events, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable laws. If the Company updates one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that the Company will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. 
 The Company, we, our or us means Stepan Company and one or more of its subsidiaries only. 
 Overview 
 The Company produces and sells intermediate chemicals that are used in a wide variety of applications worldwide. The overall business is comprised of three reportable segments: 
 Surfactants Surfactants, which accounted for 69 percent of consolidated net sales for the first nine months of 2024, are principal ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning and disinfection products such as detergents for washing clothes, dishes, carpets, floors and walls, as well as shampoos and body washes. Other applications include fabric softeners, germicidal quaternary compounds, disinfectants, lubricating ingredients, emulsifiers for spreading agricultural products and industrial applications such as latex systems, plastics and composites. Surfactants are manufactured at five sites in the United States, two European sites (United Kingdom and France), five Latin American sites (one site in Colombia and two sites in each of Mexico and Brazil) and two Asian sites (Philippines and Singapore). 
 Polymers Polymers, which accounted for 28 percent of consolidated net sales for the first nine months of 2024, include polyurethane polyols, polyester resins and phthalic anhydride. Polyurethane polyols are used in the manufacture of rigid foam for thermal insulation in the construction industry and are also a base raw material for coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers (collectively, CASE products). Powdered polyester resins are used in coating applications. CASE and powdered polyester resins are collectively referred to as specialty polyols. Phthalic anhydride is used in unsaturated polyester resins, alkyd resins and plasticizers for applications in construction materials and components of automotive, boating and other consumer products. In addition, the Company uses phthalic anhydride internally in the production of polyols. In the United States, polyurethane polyols are manufactured at the Company s Elwood, Illinois (Millsdale) and Wilmington, North Carolina sites. Phthalic anhydride is manufactured at the Company s Millsdale site and specialty polyols are manufactured at the Company s Columbus, Georgia, site. In Europe, polyurethane polyols are manufactured at the Company s plants in Germany and the Netherlands and specialty polyols are manufactured at the Company s Poland site. In Asia, polyurethane polyols and specialty polyols are manufactured at the Company s China plant. 
 Specialty Products Specialty products, which accounted for three percent of consolidated net sales for the first nine months of 2024, include flavors, emulsifiers and solubilizers used in food, flavoring, nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical applications. Specialty products are primarily manufactured at the Company s Maywood, New Jersey, site.

Deferred Compensation Plans 
 The accounting for the Company s deferred compensation plans can cause period-to-period fluctuations in Company income and expenses. Compensation expense is recognized when the value of the Company's common stock and mutual fund investment assets held for the plans increase, and compensation income is recognized when the value of the Company's common stock and mutual fund investment assets decline. The pretax effect of all deferred compensation-related activities (including realized and unrealized gains and losses on the mutual fund assets held to fund the deferred compensation obligations) and the income statement line items in which the effects of the activities were recorded are displayed in the following table:

Effects of Foreign Currency Translation 
 The Company s foreign subsidiaries transact business and report financial results in their respective local currencies. As a result, foreign subsidiary income statements are translated into U.S. dollars at average foreign exchange rates appropriate for the reporting period. Because foreign exchange rates fluctuate against the U.S. dollar over time, foreign currency translation affects period-to-period comparisons of financial statement items (i.e., because foreign exchange rates fluctuate, similar period-to-period local currency results for a foreign subsidiary may translate into different U.S. dollar results). The following table presents the effects that foreign currency translation had on the period-over-period changes in consolidated net sales and various income statement line items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Summary 
 Net income in the third quarter of 2024 was 23.6 million, or 1.03 per diluted share, versus 12.6 million, or 0.55 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income was 23.7 million, or 1.03 per diluted share, versus 14.7 million, or 0.64 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023 (see the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share section of this MD A for a reconciliation between reported net income and reported earnings per diluted share and non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share). Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were 53.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 18 percent, versus 45.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was 53.1 million, up 11 percent, versus 48.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 (see the "Reconciliation of non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA" section of this MD A for a reconciliation between reported operating income and non-GAAP EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA). Below is a summary discussion of the major factors leading to the changes in net sales, expenses and income in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. A detailed discussion of segment operating performance for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 follows the summary. 
 Consolidated net sales decreased 15.4 million, or three percent, versus the prior year quarter. Lower average selling prices negatively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 5.5 million. The decrease in average selling prices was mainly attributable to the pass-through of lower raw material costs and competitive activity within certain end markets. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 5.6 million. Consolidated sales volume decreased one percent, which negatively impacted the change in net sales by 4.3 million. Surfactant sales volume increased three percent while Polymer and Specialty Products sales volume decreased 11 percent and five percent, respectively. 
 Operating income in the third quarter of 2024 increased 4.4 million, or 23 percent, versus operating income in the third quarter of 2023. Surfactant and Specialty Products operating income increased 10.9 million and 1.3 million, respectively, versus the third quarter of 2023. Polymer operating income decreased 6.6 million versus the third quarter of 2023. Corporate expenses, including business restructuring, environmental remediation, deferred compensation and charges associated with a criminal social engineering scheme impacting one the Company's subsidiaries in Asia, increased 1.2 million, or six percent, year-over-year. See Note 17, Other Matter, and Note 18, Business Restructuring, of the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements (included in Item 1 of the Form 10-Q) for additional details regarding the criminal social engineering scheme and business restructuring expenses. 
 Operating expenses (including deferred compensation and business restructuring) were flat year-over-year. Changes in the individual income statement line items that comprise the Company s operating expenses were as follows: 
 Selling expenses decreased 0.4 million, or four percent, year-over-year. 

Administrative expenses increased 3.4 million, or 15 percent year-over-year, primarily due to a 3.3 million pre-tax charge recognized as a result of the criminal social engineering scheme impacting one of the Company's subsidiaries in Asia. 

Research, development and technical service (R D) expenses decreased 0.9 million, or seven percent, between quarters, primarily due to lower salary expenses resulting from productivity measures implemented in late 2023. 

Deferred compensation was a 0.6 million of expense in the third quarter of 2024 versus 3.1 million of income in the prior year quarter. The 3.7 million increase in deferred compensation expense was primarily due to a smaller decrease in the market price of the Company's common stock held for the plans during the third quarter of 2024 versus the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, the market value of mutual fund investment assets held for the plans appreciated during the third quarter of 2024 versus declining in value during the third quarter of 2023. See the Overview and Segment Results-Corporate Expenses section of this MD A for further details. 

Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 0.6 million, or 21 percent, versus the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to higher outstanding debt balances and higher interest rates on borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility in 2024 versus 2023. 
 Other, net was 1.0 million of income in the third quarter of 2024 versus 0.7 million of expense in the third quarter of 2023. The Company recognized 1.0 million of investment income (including realized and unrealized gains and losses) for the Company s deferred compensation and supplemental defined contribution mutual fund assets in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 0.4 million of investment losses in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, the Company reported 0.5 million of foreign exchange losses in the third quarter of 2024 versus 0.6 million of foreign exchange losses in the third quarter of 2023. The Company's net periodic pension income was 0.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 versus 0.3 million of income in the third quarter of 2023. 
 The Company s effective tax rate was a negative 10.7 percent in the third quarter of 2024 versus 20.6 percent in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the Company s intention to make an election under the US GILTI tax regime to exclude certain high taxed entities from the GILTI computation and thereby reduce the Company s GILTI tax impact. The Company continues 
 25 

to expect to elect Bonus Depreciation for its new alkoxylation facility that is being built in Pasadena, Texas and is expected to start up in December 2024. In addition, the Company s research and development tax credit is forecasted to increase throughout the rest of the year. Finally, the Company recorded a favorable provision-to-return adjustment for its 2023 tax return in the third quarter of 2024. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15 percent on reported profits (entitled "Pillar Two"). The Company does not expect Pillar Two to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flow and effective tax rate.

Net sales for North American operations decreased 6.1 million, or three percent, year-over-year. Sales volume declined two percent and negatively impacted the change in net sales by 3.7 million. The lower sales volume was primarily due to lower demand for products sold into the industrial cleaning and personal care end markets. Higher demand for products sold into the construction and industrial, oil field and agricultural end markets and to our distribution partners, partially offset the above. Lower average selling prices had a 2.2 million unfavorable impact on the change in net sales and were primarily due to the pass-through of lower raw material costs, partially offset by favorable product and customer mix. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the change in net sales by 0.2 million. 
 26 

Net sales for European operations increased 6.3 million, or 10 percent, primarily due to a 12 percent increase in sales volume that positively impacted the change in net sales by 7.2 million. The higher sales volume was primarily due to higher demand for products sold into the industrial cleaning, personal care and agricultural end markets and to our distribution partners. Lower average selling prices negatively impacted the change in net sales by 2.1 million and were primarily due to the pass-through of lower raw material costs, partially offset by more favorable product and customer mix. Foreign currency translation positively impacted the change in net sales by 1.2 million. 
 Net sales for Latin American operations increased 8.1 million, or 11 percent, primarily due to higher average selling prices and a seven percent increase in sales volume. These items positively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 12.3 million and 5.3 million, respectively. The sales volume improvement was primarily due to higher demand for products sold into the agricultural and laundry and cleaning end markets, and to our distribution partners. The higher average selling prices reflect more favorable product and customer mix. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the change in net sales by 9.5 million. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to all currencies in the region led to the unfavorable foreign currency translation effect. 
 Net sales for Asian operations increased 0.6 million, or four percent, versus the prior year quarter. A six percent increase in sales volume positively impacted the change in net sales by 0.9 million. The sales volume improvement was mainly due to higher demand for products sold to our distribution partners and into the functional products end markets. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the change in net sales by 0.3 million. 
 Surfactant operating income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 10.9 million, or 71 percent, versus operating income for the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit increased 9.9 million, or 25 percent, and operating expenses decreased 1.0 million, or four percent.

Gross profit for North American operations increased 0.2 million, or one percent. Higher average unit margins positively impacted the change in gross profit by 0.6 million. A two percent decline in sales volume negatively impacted the change in gross profit by 0.4 million. 
 Gross profit for European operations increased 3.0 million, or 51 percent, primarily due to higher average unit margins and a 12 percent increase in sales volume. These items positively impacted the change in net sales by 2.2 million and 0.7 million, respectively. The higher average unit margins were largely due to a more favorable product and customer mix. Foreign currency translation positively impacted the change in gross profit by 0.1 million. 
 Gross profit for Latin American operations increased 6.0 million, or 108 , primarily due to improved average unit margins and a seven percent increase in sales volume. These items positively impacted the change in gross profit by 7.0 million and 0.4 million, respectively. The higher average unit margins were primarily due to a more favorable product and customer mix. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the change in gross profit by 1.4 million. 
 Gross profit for Asia operations increased 0.7 million, or 25 percent, year-over-year primarily due to higher average unit margins and a six percent increase in sales volume. These items positively impacted the year-over-year change in gross profit by 0.5 million and 0.2 million, respectively. The higher average unit margins reflect a more favorable product and customer mix along with lower overhead costs due to the timing of production runs. 
 Operating expenses for the Surfactants segment decreased 1.0 million, or four percent, in the third quarter of 2024 versus the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower salary expenses.

Polymers 
 Polymer net sales for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 19.8 million, or 12 percent, versus net sales for the same period of 2023. An 11 percent decrease in sales volume and lower average selling prices negatively impacted the change in net sales by 19.2 million and 3.7 million, respectively. Foreign currency translation positively impacted the change in net sales by 3.1 million. A comparison of net sales by region follows:

Net sales for North American operations decreased 16.5 million, or 18 percent, due to a 14 percent decline in sales volume and lower average selling prices. These items negatively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 13.1 million and 3.4 million, respectively. Sales volume of polyols used in rigid foam applications declined 17 percent due to soft demand and competitive pressures. Sales volume of commodity phthalic anhydride declined 27 percent while sales volume of specialty polyols increased six percent year-over year. The lower average selling prices primarily reflect the pass-through of lower raw material costs. 
 Net sales for European operations decreased 3.1 million, or five percent, versus the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a nine percent decline in sales volume which negatively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 6.1 million. The decline in sales volume was primarily due to soft demand and competitive pressures. Foreign currency translation positively impacted the change in net sales by 3.0 million. A weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Polish zloty and British pound sterling led to the favorable foreign currency translation effect. 
 Net sales for Asia and Other operations decreased 0.1 million, or one percent, primarily due to a six percent decrease in sales volume which negatively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 0.8 million. Higher average selling prices and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation positively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 0.6 million and a 0.1 million, respectively. 
 Polymer operating income in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 6.6 million, or 30 percent, versus operating income in the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit decreased 6.8 million, or 24 percent and operating expenses decreased 0.2 million or four percent between years.

Gross profit for North American operations decreased 4.7 million, or 29 percent, due to lower average unit margins and a 14 percent decline in sales volume. These items negatively impacted the change in gross profit by 2.4 million and 2.3 million, respectively. The lower average unit margins were primarily due to less favorable product mix. 
 Gross profit for European operations decreased 2.4 million, or 22 percent, versus the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower average unit margins and a nine percent decline in sales volume that negatively impacted the change in gross profit by 1.7 million and 1.0 million, respectively. Foreign currency translation positively impacted the year-over-year change in gross profit by 0.3 million. 
 Gross profit for Asia and Other operations increased 0.3 million, or 14 percent, primarily due to higher average unit margins. These higher average unit margins positively impacted the change in net sales by 0.4 million and partially reflect the Company's product diversification efforts in China. A six percent decline in sales volume negatively impacted the change in net sales by 0.1 million. Foreign currency translation was negligible year-over-year. 
 28 

Operating expenses for the Polymer segment decreased 0.3 million, or four percent, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Specialty Products 
 Specialty Products net sales for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 4.5 million, or 24 percent, versus net sales for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was due to lower average selling prices and a five percent decrease in sales volume. Gross profit and operating income increased 1.1 million and 1.3 million, respectively, year-over-year. The year-over-year increases in gross profit and operating income were mostly attributable to higher average unit margins within the medium chain triglycerides (MCT) product line. The higher unit margins reflect the non-recurrence of high-cost inventory carryover experienced in the prior year. 
 Corporate Expenses 
 Corporate expenses, which include deferred compensation, business restructuring and other operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments, increased 1.3 million, or six percent, year-over-year. Corporate expenses were 21.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 versus 20.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to 0.6 million of deferred compensation expense in the third quarter of 2024 versus 3.1 million of deferred compensation income in the third quarter of 2023. The Company also recorded a 3.3 million expense in the third quarter of 2024 related to a criminal social engineering scheme that impacted one of the Company's subsidiaries in Asia. Partially offsetting these items was a 5.6 million business restructuring charge in the third quarter of 2023 that did not recur in 2024. See Note 17, Other Matter, and Note 18 , Business Restructuring, of the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the criminal social engineering scheme and business restructuring expenses. 
 The 3.7 million increase in deferred compensation expense was primarily due to a smaller decrease in the market price of the Company's common stock held for the plans during the third quarter of 2024 versus the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, the market value of mutual fund investment assets held for the plans appreciated during the third quarter of 2024 versus declining in value during the third quarter of 2023. The following table presents the quarter-end Company common stock market prices used in the computation of deferred compensation income/expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Summary 
 Net income in the first nine months of 2024 was 47.0 million, or 2.05 per diluted share, versus 41.4 million, or 1.80 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2023. Adjusted net income was 47.7 million, or 2.08 per diluted share, versus 43.2 million, or 1.88 per diluted share in the prior year (see the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share section of this MD A for a reconciliation between reported net income and reported earnings per diluted share and non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share). Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were 151.0 million, up eight percent, in the first nine months of 2024 versus 140.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was 151.9 million, up seven percent, versus 142.5 million in the first nine months of 2023 (see the "Reconciliation of non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA" section of this MD A for a reconciliation between reported operating income and non-GAAP EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA). Below is a summary discussion of the major factors leading to the year-over-year changes in net sales, expenses and income in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. A detailed discussion of segment operating performance for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 follows the summary. 
 Operating income for the first nine months of 2024 was 62.8 million, an eight percent increase versus operating income of 58.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. Surfactant and Specialty Products operating income increased 11.9 million and 6.6 million, respectively, versus the first nine months of 2023. Polymer operating income decreased 10.9 million year-over-year. Corporate expenses, including business restructuring, environmental remediation, deferred compensation and expenses associated with a criminal social engineering scheme at one of the Company's subsidiaries in Asia, increased 3.2 million, or six percent, year-over-year. See Note 17, Other Matter , and Note 18, Business Restructuring , of the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements (included in Item 1 of the Form 10-Q) for additional details regarding the criminal social engineering scheme charges and business restructuring expenses. Foreign currency translation had a 0.2 million favorable impact on operating income in the first nine months of 2024 versus the first nine months of 2023. 
 29 

Operating expenses (including deferred compensation and business restructuring expenses) were flat between years. Changes in the individual income statement line items that comprise the Company s operating expenses were as follows: 
 Selling expenses decreased 1.4 million, or four percent, year-over-year primarily due to lower salary expenses resulting from productivity measures implemented in late 2023. 

Administrative expenses increased 5.4 million, or eight percent, year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by a 6.8 million expense recognized for a criminal social engineering scheme impacting one of the Company's subsidiaries in Asia and higher environmental reserve expenses. The higher environmental expense is primarily due to a reserve adjustment for environmental costs related to property formerly owned and operated by the Company in Wilmington, Massachusetts. Lower salary expenses, resulting from productivity measures implemented in late 2023, partially offset the above. 

R D expenses decreased 1.8 million, or four percent, year-over-year primarily due to lower salary expenses resulting from productivity measure implemented in late 2023. 

Deferred compensation was a 2.7 million expense for the first nine months of 2024 versus 0.9 million of income during the first nine months of 2023. The 3.6 million increase in deferred compensation expense was primarily due to a smaller decrease in the market price of the Company's common stock held for the plans during the first nine months of 2024 versus the first nine months of 2023. Additionally, the market value of mutual fund investment assets held for the plans appreciated by a greater amount in 2024 versus the prior year. See the Overview and Segment Results-Corporate Expenses section of this MD A for further details. 

Net interest expense for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 0.3 million, or three percent, versus the first nine months of 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to higher non-U.S. interest income recognition and higher capitalized interest income, partially offset by higher U.S. interest expense. 
 Other, net was 4.6 million of income for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 3.3 million of income for the first nine months of 2023. The Company recognized 4.2 million of investment income (including realized and unrealized gains and losses) for the Company s deferred compensation and supplemental defined contribution mutual fund assets in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2.9 million of investment income in the first nine months of 2023. In addition, the Company reported foreign exchange losses of 0.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 versus 0.6 million of foreign exchange losses in the first nine months of 2023. The Company also reported 0.2 million of higher net periodic pension income in the first nine months of 2024 versus the first nine months of 2023. 
 The Company s effective tax rate was 18.9 percent for the first nine months of 2024 versus 20.5 percent for the first nine months of 2023. This is primarily due to the Company's increased research development tax credit for 2024. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15 percent on reported profits (entitled "Pillar Two"). The Company does not expect Pillar Two to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flow and effective tax rate.

Segment Results 
 Surfactants 
 Surfactants net sales for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 80.0 million, or six percent, versus net sales for the first nine months of 2023. Lower average selling prices negatively impacted the change in net sales by 113.3 million. The lower average selling prices were mainly due to declining raw material costs, less favorable product mix and increased competitive activity within the European and Latin American end-markets. Sales volume increased three percent and positively impacted the change in net sales by 35.2 million. Foreign currency translation had a 1.9 million unfavorable impact on the year-over-year change in net sales. A year-over-year comparison of net sales by region follows:

Net sales for North American operations decreased 64.6 million, or nine percent, year-over-year. Lower average selling prices had a 40.9 million unfavorable impact on the change in net sales and were primarily attributable to the pass-through of lower raw material costs and less favorable product mix. Sales volume decreased three percent and negatively impacted the change in net sales by 23.4 million. The decrease in sales volume primarily reflects lower demand for products sold into the agricultural end markets due to customer and channel inventory destocking during the first half of 2024. In addition, sales volume into the personal care end markets was negatively impacted by operational issues, partially related to a flood event at the Elwood, Illinois (Millsdale) site, during the first half of 2024. Higher demand for products sold into the oil field, construction and industrial solutions, and to our distribution partners partially offset the aforementioned decline. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 0.3 million. 
 Net sales for European operations decreased 19.4 million, or nine percent, primarily due to lower average selling prices that negatively impacted the change in net sales by 40.5 million. The lower average selling prices were primarily due to the pass-through of lower raw material costs, less favorable product mix and increased competitive activity within certain end-use markets. Sales volume was up nine percent and positively impacted the change in net sales by 18.7 million. The higher sales volume was primarily due to higher demand for products sold into the consumer products and construction and industrial solutions end markets and to our distribution partners. Foreign currency translation positively impacted the change in net sales by 2.4 million. A weaker U.S. dollar relative to the European euro and British pound sterling led to the favorable foreign currency translation effect. 
 Net sales for Latin American operations increased 10.3 million, or four percent, primarily due to a 13 percent increase in sales volume which positively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 29.6 million. The higher sales volume was primarily due to higher demand for products sold into the agricultural and the laundry and cleaning end markets combined with higher demand from our distribution partners. Lower average selling prices negatively impacted the change in net sales by 16.3 million and primarily reflect lower raw material costs and increased competitive activity within certain end-use markets. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real primarily led to a 3.0 million unfavorable foreign currency translation effect. 
 Net sales for Asian operations decreased 6.3 million, or 14 percent, year-over-year. Lower average selling prices, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and a two percent decline in sales volume, negatively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 4.6 million, 1.0 million and 0.7 million, respectively. The decline in average selling prices primarily reflects the pass-through of lower raw material costs. The decline in volume primarily reflects less demand for products sold into the commodity laundry and cleaning end markets, partially offset by higher demand for products sold into the personal care end markets and to our distribution partners.

Gross profit for North American operations decreased 7.5 million, or nine percent, versus the prior year due to lower average unit margins and a three percent decline in sales volume. These items negatively impacted the year-over-year change in gross profit by 4.8 million and 2.7 million, respectively. The lower average unit margins were mostly attributable to less favorable product mix, higher pre-operating expenses associated with the alkoxylation production facility that is being built in Pasadena, Texas and higher expenses incurred at the Company's Millsdale plant site due to operational issues, partially related to a flood event, during the first half of 2024. 
 Gross profit for European operations increased 2.5 million, or 12 percent, due to a nine percent increase in sales volume, higher average unit margins and the favorable impact of the foreign currency translation. These items positively impacted the year-over-year change in gross profit by 1.8 million, 0.5 million and 0.2 million, respectively. 
 Gross profit for Latin American operations increased 11.5 million, or 58 percent, due to improved average unit margins and a 13 percent increase in sales volume. These items positively impacted the year-over-year change in gross profit by 9.9 million and 2.5 million, respectively. The higher average unit margins were primarily due to a more favorable product and customer mix. Foreign currency translation had a 0.9 million unfavorable impact on the change in gross profit. 
 Gross profit for Asian operations increased 3.3 million, or 64 percent, primarily due to higher average unit margins that positively impacted the year-over-year change in gross profit by 3.4 million. The higher average unit margins were primarily due to lower overhead costs due to the timing of production runs. A two percent decline in sales volume negatively impacted the year-over-year change in gross profit by 0.1 million. 
 Operating expenses for the Surfactant segment decreased 2.1 million, or three percent, year-over-year. This decrease was mainly attributable to lower salary expenses and bad debt provision expenses. 
 Polymers 
 Polymer net sales for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 40.1 million, or eight percent, versus net sales for the same period of 2023. Lower average selling prices and a three percent decrease in sales volume negatively impacted the change in net sales by 34.6 million and 14.4 million, respectively. Foreign currency translation had an 8.9 million favorable impact on the change in net sales year-over-year. A year-over-year comparison of net sales by region follows:

Net sales for North American operations decreased 36.2 million, or 14 percent, due to an eight percent decrease in sales volume and lower average selling prices. These items negatively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 20.4 million and 15.8 million, respectively. The lower average selling prices primarily reflect the pass-through of lower raw material costs. Sales volume within the commodity phthalic anhydride business declined 41 percent primarily due to operational issues at the Millsdale plant during 
 32 

the first half of 2024. Sales volume of polyols used in rigid foam applications decreased five percent year-over-year due to soft demand during the third quarter of 2024, which offset higher sales volume recognized during the first half of 2024. Sales volume of specialty polyols increased eight percent year-over-year. 
 Net sales for European operations decreased 6.8 million, or three percent, year-over-year. Lower average selling prices and a one percent decline in sales volume negatively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 15.0 million and 1.6 million, respectively. The lower average selling prices were primarily due to the pass-through of lower raw material costs and increased competitive activity. Foreign currency translation positively impacted the change in net sales by 9.8 million. A weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Polish zloty and British pound sterling led to the favorable foreign currency translation effect. 
 Net sales for Asia and Other operations increased 2.9 million, or eight percent, due to an 11 percent increase in sales volume which positively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 3.7 million. The higher sales volume was driven by the non-recurrence of COVID lock downs and restrictions that were in place in China during the first half of 2023 and higher demand for specialty polyols resulting from the Company's product diversification efforts. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the year-over-year change in net sales by 0.8 million. 
 Polymer operating income for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 10.9 million, or 23 percent, versus operating income for the first nine months of 2023.

Gross profit for North American operations decreased 7.3 million, or 21 percent, due to lower average unit margins and an eight percent decline in sales volume. These items negatively impacted the change in gross profit by 4.6 million and 2.7 million, respectively. The lower average unit margins largely reflect a phthalic anhydride related catalyst write-off 2.1 million) during the second quarter of 2024 and higher expenses incurred at the Company's Millsdale plant due to operational issues during the first half of 2024. 
 Gross profit for European operations decreased 6.0 million, or 19 percent, versus the first nine months of 2023. This decrease was largely due to lower average unit margins and a one percent decline in sales volume that negatively impacted the change in gross profit by 6.7 million and 0.2 million, respectively. The lower average unit margins primarily reflect increased competitive activity. Foreign currency translation had a 0.9 million favorable impact on the change in gross profit. 
 Gross profit for Asia and Other operations increased 2.1 million, primarily due to higher average unit margins and an 11 percent increase in sales volume, driven largely by the Company's diversification efforts in China. These items positively impacted the change in gross profit by 1.8 million and 0.4 million, respectively. Foreign currency translation had a 0.1 million unfavorable impact on the change in gross profit year-over-year. 
 Operating expenses for the Polymers segment decreased 0.4 million, or two percent, year-over-year. 
 Specialty Products 
 Specialty Products net sales for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 18.8 million, or 29 percent, versus net sales for the first nine months of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices that were partially offset by a one percent increase in sales volume. Gross profit and operating income increased 6.1 million and 6.6 million, respectively, year-over-year. The year-over-year increases in gross profit and operating income were mostly attributable to higher average unit margins within the medium chain triglycerides (MCT) product line. The higher average unit margins reflect the non-recurrence of high-cost inventory carryover experienced in the prior year. 
 Corporate Expenses 
 Corporate expenses, which include deferred compensation, business restructuring, and other operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments, increased 3.2 million, or six percent, between years. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to 6.8 million of pre-tax charges associated with a criminal social engineering scheme impacting one of the Company's subsidiaries in 
 33 

Asia (see Note 17, Other Matter, of the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the criminal social engineering scheme) and higher deferred compensation and environmental reserve expenses. The higher environmental reserve expenses in 2024 were primarily driven by a reserve adjustment for environmental costs related to property formerly owned and operated by the Company in Wilmington, Massachusetts. These increases were partially offset by the non-recurrence of 5.8 million of business restructuring expenses incurred in 2023 (see Note 18, Business Restructuring , of the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional details) and lower 2024 salary expenses related to productivity measures implemented in late 2023. 
 Deferred compensation expense was 2.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 versus 0.9 million of income during the same period of 2023. The 3.6 million increase in deferred compensation expense was attributable to a smaller decrease in the market price of the Company's common stock held for the plans during the first nine months of 2024 versus the first nine months of 2023. The market price of Company common stock decreased 17.30 per share during the first nine months of 2024 versus a 31.49 per share decrease in the first nine months of 2023. Additionally, the market value of mutual fund investment assets held for the plans appreciated by a greater amount in 2024 versus the prior year.

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities were a cash source of 27.5 million in 2024 compared to a cash use of 152.1 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Working capital requirements were lower in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the changes noted above. The change in inventories working capital primarily reflects the extensive efforts to reduce inventory levels in 2023 (source of cash) versus targeted inventory builds in 2024 in advance of two Polymer plant maintenance turnarounds and a third quarter 2024 inventory build in preparation for the hurricane season (use of cash). The change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due in large part to lower 2024 cash outlays required to meet lower incentive-based compensation, tax and other year-end obligations closely linked to lower 2023 earnings. It is management s opinion that the Company s liquidity is sufficient to provide for potential increases in working capital requirements during 2024. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used for investing activities decreased 131.2 million year-over-year. Cash used for capital expenditures was 86.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 versus 213.6 million in the same period of 2023. The lower capital spending in 2024 was largely attributable to reduced spending required to complete construction of the alkoxylation plant the Company is building at its Pasadena, Texas site. 
 For 2024, the Company estimates that total capital expenditures will be in the range of 120.0 million to 125.0 million. This full year projected spending includes completion of the new alkoxylation plant that is being built in Pasadena, Texas, along with growth initiatives, infrastructure and optimization initiatives. 
 34 

Financing Activities 
 Cash flow from financing activities was a source of 6.9 million in 2024 versus a source of 36.6 million in 2023. The year-over-year change was primarily due to a lower level of borrowings against the Company's revolving credit facility and higher scheduled debt repayments in 2024 versus the comparable period in 2023. 
 The Company purchases shares of its common stock in the open market or from its benefit plans from time to time to fund its own benefit plans and to mitigate the dilutive effect of new shares issued under its compensation plans. The Company may, from time to time, seek to purchase additional amounts of its outstanding equity and/or retire debt securities through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including pursuant to plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 promulgated by the SEC. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. The Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock on the open market during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 125.1 million remaining under the share repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors. 
 Debt and Credit Facilities 
 Consolidated balance sheet debt increased from 654.1 million on December 31, 2023 to 688.5 million on September 30, 2024, primarily due to domestic borrowings from the Company s revolving credit facility partially offset by scheduled debt repayments. Net debt (which is defined as total debt minus cash see the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Net Debt section of this MD A) increased 16.9 million, from 524.3 million at December 31, 2023 to 541.2 million at September 30, 2024. This change reflects a cash increase of 17.5 million and a total debt increase of 34.4 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus shareholders equity was 30.7 percent versus 30.0 percent at December 31, 2023 (see the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Net Debt section in this MD A for further details). On September 30, 2024, the Company s debt included 311.6 million of unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from 2024 through 2032, that were issued to insurance companies in private placement transactions pursuant to note purchase agreements (the Note Purchase Agreements), a 91.3 million delayed draw term loan borrowed pursuant to the Company's credit agreement, 278.7 million of short term loans borrowed under the Company's revolving credit facility and 6.9 million of foreign credit line borrowings. The proceeds from the note issuances have been the Company s primary source of long-term debt financing and are supplemented by borrowings under bank credit facilities to meet short and medium-term liquidity needs. On August 27, 2024, the Company entered into amendments to two of its note purchase agreements to increase the available facility amounts and extend the end date of the issuance period to August 27, 2027. 
 The Company's credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks provides for credit facilities in an initial aggregate principal amount of 450.0 million, consisting of (a) a 350.0 million multi-currency revolving credit facility and (b) a 100.0 million delayed draw term loan credit facility, each of which matures on June 24, 2027. The Company's credit agreement with Credit Industriel et Commercial NY (the CIC Credit Agreement) provides for a credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 8.7 million. The facility is for the sole purpose of the issuance of standby letters of credit. The Company also maintains import and export letters of credit, and standby letters of credit under its workers compensation insurance agreements and for other purposes, as needed from time to time, which are issued under the Credit Agreement and under the CIC Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings totaling 370.0 million, inclusive of a 91.3 million delayed draw term loan, and letters of credit totaling 11.4 million under the Credit Agreement, with 59.9 million remaining available. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had an outstanding letter of credit of 8.7 million under the CIC Credit Agreement. 
 The Company anticipates that cash from operations, committed credit facilities and cash on hand will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures, working capital, dividends and other planned financial commitments for the foreseeable future. 
 Certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company maintain short-term bank lines of credit in their respective local currencies to meet working capital requirements as well as to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. At September 30, 2024, the Company s foreign subsidiaries had 6.9 million of outstanding debt. 
 The Company is subject to covenants under its material debt agreements that require the maintenance of minimum interest coverage and minimum net worth. These debt covenants also limit the incurrence of additional debt as well as the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares. Under the most restrictive of these debt covenants: 

1. 
 The Company is required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined within the agreements, of 3.50 to 1.00, for the preceding four calendar quarters. 

2. 
 The Company is required to maintain an existing maximum net leverage ratio, as defined within the agreements, not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00. 

3. 
 The Company is required to maintain net worth of at least 750.0 million. 

35 

4. 
 The Company is permitted to pay dividends and purchase treasury shares after June 24, 2022, in amounts of up to 100.0 million plus 100 percent of net income and cash proceeds of stock option exercises, measured cumulatively beginning January 1, 2022. The maximum amount of dividends that could have been paid within this limitation is disclosed as unrestricted retained earnings in Note 14, Debt , of the notes to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements (included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). 

The Company believes it was in compliance with the covenants under its material debt agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS 
 The Company s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and similar laws in the other countries in which the Company does business. Although the Company's environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, future developments and increasingly stringent environmental regulation may require the Company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. The Company will continue to invest in the equipment and facilities necessary to comply with existing and future regulations. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, the Company s expenditures for capital projects related to environmental matters were 7.0 million and 7.1 million, respectively. These projects are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which are typically 10 years. Recurring costs associated with the operation and maintenance of facilities for waste treatment and disposal and managing environmental compliance in ongoing operations at the Company s manufacturing locations were 40.0 million and 27.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Over the years, the Company has received requests for information related to or has been named by the government as a potentially responsible party at a number of waste disposal sites where cleanup costs have been or may be incurred under CERCLA and similar state or foreign statutes. In addition, the Company is from time to time involved in routine legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business, including personal injury, property damage, tax, trade and labor matters. The Company believes that it has made adequate provisions for the costs it is likely to incur with respect to these claims. It is the Company s accounting policy to record liabilities when environmental assessments, remediation expenses or legal proceeding losses are probable, and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum is accrued. Estimating the possible costs of environmental remediation requires making assumptions related to the nature and extent of contamination and the methods and resulting costs of remediation. Some of the factors on which the Company bases its estimates include information provided by decisions rendered by State and Federal environmental regulatory agencies, information provided by feasibility studies, and remedial action plans developed. After partial remediation payments at certain sites, the Company has estimated a range of possible environmental and legal losses of 21.5 million to 48.9 million at September 30, 2024 and 20.6 million to 49.4 million at December 31, 2023. Within the range of possible environmental and legal losses, management has currently concluded that no single amount is more likely to occur than any other amounts in the range and, thus, has accrued at the lower end of the range. The Company's environmental and legal accruals totaled 21.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 20.6 million at December 31, 2023. Because the liabilities accrued are estimates, actual amounts could differ materially from the amounts reported. Cash expenditures related to environmental remediation and certain other legal matters approximated 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.4 million for the same period in 2023. 
 For certain sites, the Company has responded to information requests made by federal, state or local government agencies but has received no response confirming or denying the Company s stated positions. As such, estimates of the total costs, or range of possible costs, of remediation, if any, or the Company s share of such costs, if any, cannot be determined with respect to these sites. Consequently, the Company is unable to predict the effect thereof on the Company s financial position, cash flows and results of operations. Based on the Company s present knowledge with respect to its involvement at these sites, the possibility of other viable entities responsibilities for cleanup, and the extended period over which any costs would be incurred, management believes that the Company has no material liability at these sites and that these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position. Certain of these matters are discussed in Item 1, Part 2, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Legal Proceedings, in this report and in other filings of the Company with the SEC, which are available upon request from the Company. See also Note 8, Contingencies , in the notes to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements (included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for a summary of the significant environmental proceedings related to certain sites. 
 OUTLOOK 
 Management is pleased that several of its Surfactant businesses delivered strong volume growth in the quarter. Agricultural sales volumes grew double-digits in the third quarter, which aligns with the Company's expectations for a second half 2024 recovery. Rigid Polyols demand should increase as the market gets more macro-economic clarity and the interest rate environment improves. Free cash flow should continue to improve driven by the completion of the Company's Pasadena investment, growth in market volumes, and the 
 36 

Company's continued focus on cost reduction. Management believes the Company is positioned to deliver full year Adjusted EBIDTA growth and positive free cash flow.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS 
 The Company believes that certain non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful for evaluating the Company s performance and financial condition. Internally, the Company uses this non-GAAP information as an indicator of business performance and evaluates management s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in analyzing what management views as the Company s core operating performance for purposes of business decision making. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with useful supplemental information because they (i) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding items affecting comparability between periods, (ii) permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate the Company s core operating performance across periods, and (iii) otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company s financial results. In addition, the Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those GAAP financial measures, provides investors with additional tools to understand the factors and trends affecting the Company s underlying business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. For example, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Form 10-Q may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures the same way as the Company does. 
 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and Earnings Per Share 
 Management uses the non-GAAP adjusted net income metrics to evaluate the Company s operating performance. Management excludes the items listed in the table below because they are non-operational items. The cumulative tax effect was calculated using the statutory tax rates for the jurisdictions in which the noted transactions occurred.

Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes to the market risks described in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Item 4 Controls and Procedures 
 a. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, such that the information required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 b. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Part II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1 Legal Proceedings 
 SEC regulations require the Company to disclose certain information about administrative or judicial proceedings involving certain environmental matters to which a governmental authority is a party if the Company reasonably believes that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a specified threshold. Pursuant to SEC regulations, the Company has adopted a threshold of 1.0 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. The Company believes that this threshold is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceedings that are material to its business or financial condition. 
 There have been no material changes to the legal proceedings disclosed in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 
 Item 1A Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for the modification of the risk factor set forth below: 
 Interruption of, damage to or compromise of the Company s IT systems, failure to maintain the integrity of customer, colleague or Company data or illegal or fraudulent activities committed against the Company could harm the Company s reputation and have an adverse effect on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The Company relies on IT systems in its operations, including production, supply chain, research and development, finance, human resource and regulatory functions. The Company s ability to effectively manage its business depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of these systems. IT system failures due to events including but not limited to network disruptions, programming errors, computer viruses and security breaches (e.g., cyber-attacks) could impact production activities, impede shipment of products, cause delays or cancellations of customer orders, or hamper the processing of transactions or reporting of financial results. These or similar occurrences, whether accidental or intentional, could result in theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property or confidential business information of our employees, customers, suppliers or other third parties, which could harm our reputation and competitive position, reduce the value of our investments in research and development and other strategic initiatives, result in a loss of business, as well as remedial and other costs, fines, investigations, enforcement actions or lawsuits or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 During the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information and communications technology and related systems. Despite the security measures the Company has in place, the Company s customers and suppliers information and operational technology systems could be vulnerable to cyber-threats such as computer viruses or other malicious codes, security breaches, unauthorized access, phishing attacks and other disruptions from system failures, including network outages, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors or cyber-attacks by hackers, criminal groups, nation-states and nation-state-sponsored organizations. In addition, if a material, actual or perceived breach of our security 
 40 

occurs, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers or suppliers. Any such material disruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The defensive measures and training that we take to limit and manage threats, especially cyber-related and social engineering threats, to our business may not adequately anticipate, prevent or mitigate harm we may suffer from such threats. Criminals use evolving and increasingly sophisticated methods of perpetrating illegal and fraudulent activities. For example, we determined in July 2024 that one of the Company s subsidiaries in Asia was the victim of criminal social engineering scheme that resulted in a series of fraudulently-induced outbound payments for which the Company recognized pre-tax charges of 3,500,000 and 3,300,000 for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, respectively. See Note 17, Other Matter , of the notes to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the criminal social engineering scheme. Fraudulent activities committed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The Company continues to develop and enhance controls and security measures designed to protect against the risk of theft, loss or fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, supplier, third party, employee or Company data, or illegal or fraudulent activities committed against the Company and it maintains an ongoing process to re-evaluate the adequacy of its controls and measures. The Company may also be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance its privacy and security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities. The Company maintains what it believes to be adequate and collectible insurance in the event of the theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, supplier, third party, employee or Company data, but any such occurrences could result in costs that may not be covered or may be in excess of any available insurance that the Company may have procured. While the Company has a comprehensive program in place for continuously reviewing, maintaining, testing and upgrading its IT systems and security, there can be no assurance that such efforts will prevent breakdowns of or breaches in Company IT systems or illegal or fraudulent activities committed against the Company that could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
