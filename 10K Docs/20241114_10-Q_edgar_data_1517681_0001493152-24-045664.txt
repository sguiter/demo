The
Company may apply for research and development tax concessions with the Australian Taxation Office on an annual basis. Although the amount
is possible to estimate at year end, the Australian Taxation Office may reject or materially alter the claim amount. Accordingly, the
Company does not recognize the benefit of the claim amount until cash receipt since collectability is not certain until such time. The
tax concession is a refundable credit. If the Company has net income, then the Company can receive the credit which reduces its income
tax liability. If the Company has net losses, then the Company may still receive a cash payment for the credit, however, the Company s
net operating loss carryforwards are reduced by the gross equivalent loss that would produce the credit amount when the income tax rate
is applied to that gross amount. The concession is recognized as a tax benefit, in operations, upon receipt.

conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months
from the issue date of this Quarterly Report. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Successful
completion of the Company s development program and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent upon future
events, including obtaining adequate financing to fulfill its development activities, acceptance of the Company s patent applications,
obtaining additional sources of suitable and adequate financing and ultimately achieving a level of sales adequate to support the Company s
cost structure and business plan. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on its ability to further
develop and execute on its business plan. However, there can be no assurances that any or all of these endeavors will be successful.

spreading through the body. Our lead product candidate, PRP, is a variation upon our novel formulation and involves pro-enzymes, the
inactive precursors of enzymes. 

Recent
Developments 

On
August 7, 2024, we received written consent in lieu of a meeting by the holders of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding
capital stock as of August 7, 2024 and our Board of Directors approving such actions as are necessary for us to proceed to, and accordingly
intends to, effectuate and execute a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one post-split share per sixty thousand pre-split shares (1:60,000) (the Reverse Stock Split ). Proportional adjustments for the Reverse Stock Split will be made to our outstanding
stock options, warrants and equity incentive plans. We are awaiting the approval of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA for the market effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split. 

On August 14, 2024, allowance for
the Company s proenzyme composition patent was received from the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO). The
patent broadly captures both high dose and high ratio claims for future clinical doses of the company s lead asset, PRP. This is
the second Canadian patent either allowed or granted in this important North American jurisdiction. The proenzymes composition patent
is an important part of the IP portfolio covering possible future clinical dosage ranges for PRP, as the Company advances to a Phase 1,
First-In-Human (FIH) study in advanced cancer patients suffering from solid tumors. 

On August 21, 2024, we reported
that two scientific, peer reviewed journal articles published by the Company and its research partners reached 10 citations and 4,500
reads, respectively. Published data from the Company s joint research and development program were generated in conjunction with
the Universities of Ja n and Granada, Biosanitary Research Institute of Granada, and University Hospital, Spain. 

On
October 30, 2024, we filed an S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an underwritten offering that
reflects the proposed reverse split of the outstanding Common Stock and treasury stock of the Company at an assumed 1- for- 60,000 ratio,
which is anticipated to occur prior to the closing of the offering. Our Common Stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink Marketplace
operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. OTC under the symbol PPCB. In connection with this offering, we
have applied to have our Common Stock listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol PPCB. 

Results
of Operations 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included elsewhere in this Report. The results discussed below are of the Company and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Propanc
PTY LTD. 

For
the Three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the Three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenue 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated no revenue because we are currently undertaking research and development
activities for market approval and no sales were generated in this period. 

Administration
Expense 

Administration
expense decreased to 220,759 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 393,828 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. This decrease of approximately 173,000 is primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately 144,000 in general consulting,
legal and investor relation fees and decrease in accounting fees of approximately 6,000, decrease of approximately 40,000 in employee
remuneration expense offset by increase in stock-based expenses of approximately 8,000, increase in marketing expenses of 8,000 and
increase in other general and administrative expenses of approximately 1,000. 

3 

Occupancy
Expense 

Occupancy
expenses increased to 8,317 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 7,149 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. This increase of approximately 1,000 is primarily attributable to exchange rate movements over the period when compared to
the same period in 2023. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses were increased to 61,714 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 16,242 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in research and development expenses of approximately 45,000. 

Such
research and development expenses are related to the two-year collaboration agreement with University of Ja n, which was executed
in October 2020 to provide certain research services to the Company ending on October 2022, relating to the investigation of a fully
synthetic recombinant version of PRP. Additionally, on July 27, 2022, the Company entered into another two-year research agreement with
the University of Ja n to provide certain research and experiment services to the Company relating to the investigation of the
effects of pancreatic proenzymes against the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, we also allocate a portion of the management s
salary to research and development expenses. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense decreased to 86,230 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 178,234 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. Interest expense is primarily comprised of approximately 57,000 of debt discount amortization and interest expense from accrual
of interest expense and other financing fees for a total of approximately 29,000 for the for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

This
decrease in interest expense of 92,004 is primarily attributable to the decrease in amortization of debt discount of approximately 12,000
and decrease of approximately 89,000 in accretion of put premium. 

Derivative
Expense 

Derivative
expense decreased to 27,182 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 77,721 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. This decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in issuance of convertible notes to GS Capital which initial value
was bifurcated from the embedded conversion option and was recorded as derivative expense. 

Change
in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities 

Change
in fair value of derivative liabilities were decreased to a gain of 52,787 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to a gain of 303,929 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in gain of approximately 251,000 is primarily attributable
to a decrease in fair value of the principal amount of convertible notes with bifurcated embedded conversion option derivatives as a
result of the decrease in stock prices during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Gain
(Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt, net 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, notes with principal amounts totaling 30,800, accrued interest of 2,212 and conversion fees
of 798 containing bifurcated embedded conversion option derivatives were converted into common stock. Accordingly, the fair market value
of the shares issued upon conversion was 79,176, resulting in a loss on extinguishment at the time of conversion of 45,365 and 34,046
of derivative liability fair value was recorded as a gain on extinguishment at the time of conversion, resulting in a net loss of 11,319
which is included in gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2023, notes with principal amounts totaling 70,800, accrued interest of 5,184 and conversion fees
of 1,437 containing bifurcated embedded conversion option derivatives were converted into common stock. Accordingly, the fair market
value of the shares issued upon conversion was 191,043, resulting in a loss on extinguishment at the time of conversion of 113,622
and 147,932 of derivative liability fair value was recorded as a gain on extinguishment at the time of conversion, resulting in a net
gain of 34,310 which is included in gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Foreign
Currency Transaction Gain (Loss) 

Foreign
currency transaction gain (loss) decreased to a loss of 8,423 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a loss of 15,948) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease of approximately 24,000 is partially attributable to the increase
in exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net
loss 

Net
loss decreased to 354,310 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss of 350,866 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The change relates to the factors discussed above. 

Deemed
dividend 

The
Company recognized the value of the effect of a down round feature related to our Series A warrants when triggered. Upon the occurrence
of the triggering event that resulted in a reduction of the strike price, the Company measured the value of the effect of the feature
as the difference between the fair value of the warrants without the down round feature or before the strike price reduction and the
fair value of the warrants with a strike price corresponding to the reduced strike price upon the down round feature being triggered.
Accordingly, the Company recognized deemed dividend of 0 and 142,575 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
and a corresponding reduction of income available to common stockholders upon the alternate cashless exercise of these warrants during
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

4 

Net
loss available to common stockholders 

Net
loss available to common stockholders decreased to 354,310 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss available
to common stockholders of 493,441 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease of approximately 139,000 is primarily
attributable to the change relates to the factors discussed above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Current
Financial Condition 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had total assets of 63,644, comprised primarily of cash of 9,268, GST tax receivable of 3,309, prepaid expenses
and other current assets of 8,957, security deposit of 2,081, and operating lease ROU asset, net of 12,912. As compared to June 30,
2024, we had total assets of 72,365, comprised primarily of cash of 21,085, GST tax receivable of 2,950, prepaid expenses and other
current assets of 1,406, deferred offering cost of 27,117, security deposit of 2,008, and operating lease ROU asset, net of 17,799. 

We
had current liabilities of 4,101,244, primarily comprised of net convertible debt of 381,789, accounts payable and accrued expenses
of 2,113,788, employee benefit liability of 677,902, loans payable of 145,091, loans payable-related parties of 227,328, note payable,
net of 213,109 and embedded conversion option liabilities of 134,234 as of September 30, 2024. As compared to June 30, 2024, we had
current liabilities of 3,792,782, primarily comprised of net convertible debt of 399,325, accounts payable and accrued expenses of
 2,100,137, employee benefit liability of 639,371, loans payable of 145,091, loans payable related party of 71,629, note payable,
net of 204,694 and embedded conversion option liabilities of 133,886 as of June 30, 2024. 

We
have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity and/or convertible securities for cash. The cash was used primarily
for payments for research and development, administration expenses, occupancy expenses, professional fees, consultants and travel. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 we received proceeds from issuance of note of 60,000 and proceeds from issuance of loan payable
from related parties of 155,699. 

We
have substantial capital resource requirements and have incurred significant losses since inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had
 9,268 in cash. We depend upon debt and/or equity financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our current business plan.
Such capital requirements are in excess of what we have in available cash and for which we currently have commitments. Therefore, we
presently do not have enough available cash to meet our obligations over the next 12 months. If continued funding and capital resources
are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may curtail our plan of operations. We will be required to obtain alternative or additional financing
from financial institutions, investors or otherwise, in order to maintain and expand our existing operations. The failure by us to obtain
such financing would have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations, and adversely affecting
our ability to complete ongoing activities in connection with our research and development programs.

Net
Cash Flow from Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 235,515 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to our net loss of 354,310 offset
primarily by non-cash charges of amortization of debt discount of 56,983, non-cash interest expense of 2,548, derivative expense of
 27,182, foreign currency transaction gain of 8,423, addback change in fair value of derivatives of 52,787 and loss from extinguishment
of debt of 11,319. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled 68,939, which is primarily attributable to increase accrued
interest of 24,093 and increase in accrued expenses and other payables of 54,457. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 333,457 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to our net loss of 350,866 offset
primarily by non-cash charges of amortization of debt discount of 69,457, non-cash interest expense of 1,437, accretion of put premium
of 88,846, derivative expense of 77,721, foreign currency transaction loss of 15,948, addback change in fair value of derivatives
of 303,929 and gain from extinguishment of debt of 34,310. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled 96,977, which is
primarily attributable to increase in prepaid expense of 14,468, increase in refundable advance deposit of 116,169, increase accrued
interest of 15,712, increase in accounts payable of 148,834, and increase in accrued expenses and other payables of 55,693.

Net
Cash Flow from Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 215,699. During the three months ended September
30, 2024 we received net proceeds from issuance of convertible notes of 60,000 and proceeds from issuance of loan from related parties
of 155,699. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 350,347. During the three months ended September
30, 2023 we received net proceeds from issuance of convertible notes of 220,000, proceed from issuance of note of 120,000, proceeds
from issuance of loan from a related party of 153,256 offset by repayment of convertible note of 142,909. 

Effect
of Exchange Rate 

The
effect of the exchange rate on cash resulted in a 7,999 positive adjustment to cash flows in the three months ended September 30, 2024
as compared to a 20,312 negative adjustment to cash flows in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The reason for the fluctuation
is due to the application of currency translation rates throughout the cash flow statement, the volume of transactions within each period
and the daily fluctuation in exchange rates. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Below
is a discussion of our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining (i) the methodology used in calculating
the estimates, (ii) the inherent uncertainties pertaining to such estimates, and (iii) the possible effects of a significant variance
in actual experience, from that of the estimate, on our financial condition. Estimates involve numerous assumptions that, if incorrect,
could create a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and financial condition. 

Reference

Derivative
Instruments: ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
and for hedging activities by requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value. Gains or
losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings. On the date of conversion, or payoff, of debt,
we record the fair value of the conversion shares, remove the fair value of the related derivative liability, remove any discounts and
record a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Please
see section captioned Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
included in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements. 

Going
Concern Qualification 

We
did not generate any revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and have incurred significant losses and cash used
in operations, and such losses and use of cash are expected to continue. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included
a Going Concern Qualification in their audit report for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition,
we have negative working capital and convertible debt that is past maturity that we are currently negotiating with lenders in order to
amend the maturity dates. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12
months from the issue date of this report. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to execute our strategy
and on our ability to raise additional funds and/or to consummate a public offering. Management is currently seeking additional funds,
primarily through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities for cash to operate our business. No assurance can be given that any
future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain
additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution
for our stockholders, in case of equity and/or convertible debt financing. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Going Concern Qualification might make it substantially more
difficult to raise capital. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) that are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of disclosure controls and
procedures in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management
recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of possible controls and procedures. 

6 

At
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we conducted an evaluation (the Evaluation ), under the supervision
and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of September 30, 2024, the disclosure controls and procedures of our Company were not effective to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports was recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis due to the material
weaknesses in financial reporting as discussed below. 

Material
Weaknesses and Corrective Actions 

The
framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled 2013 Internal Control
- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, COSO ). In
connection with the audits of our financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we identified certain deficiencies
relating to our internal control over financial reporting that constitute a material weakness under standards established by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB ). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
within the meaning of PCAOB Audit Standard No. 5, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

The
following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting continued to exist at September 30, 2024: 

we
 do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
 over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 

we
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our limited size
 and early-stage nature of operations, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically
 feasible; however, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions
 should be performed by separate individuals; 

lack
 of audit committee of our board of directors; and 

insufficient
 monitoring and review controls over the financial reporting closing process, including the lack of individuals with current knowledge
 of U.S. GAAP. 

We
outsource certain of the functions that would normally be performed by a principal financial officer to assist us in implementing the
necessary financial controls over the financial reporting and the utilization of internal management and staff to effectuate these controls. 

We
believe that these material weaknesses primarily relate, in part, to our lack of sufficient staff with appropriate training in U.S. GAAP
and SEC rules and regulations with respect to financial reporting functions, and the lack of robust accounting systems, as well as the
lack of sufficient resources to hire such staff and implement these accounting systems. 

We
plan to take a number of actions in the future to correct these material weaknesses including, but not limited to, establishing an audit
committee of our board of directors comprised of at least two independent directors, adding experienced accounting and financial personnel
and retaining third-party consultants to review our internal controls and recommend improvements, subject to receiving sufficient additional
capital. If we receive sufficient capital, we hope to increase the chief financial officer s role from part-time to full-time as
the next step in building out our accounting department. We will need to take additional measures to fully mitigate these issues, and
the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to (1) address the issues identified,
(2) ensure that our internal controls are effective or (3) ensure that the identified material weakness or other material weaknesses
will not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In addition, other material weaknesses may
be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our Common Stock, cause investors
to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally
materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder, as there was no general solicitation to the investors
and the transactions did not involve any public offering. All certificates evidencing the shares sold bore a restrictive legend. No underwriter
participated in the offer and sale of these securities, and no commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly
in connection therewith. The proceeds from these sales were used for general corporate purposes. 

Item
