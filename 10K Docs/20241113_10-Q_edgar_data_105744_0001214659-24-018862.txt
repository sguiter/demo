 Notes To Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

. 

In August 2020, the Company sold its oil and gas operations to a third
party. On January 1, 2022, the Company entered into a Consulting Management Agreement with respect to such oil and gas operations; whereby,
the Company would provide management, supervisory and administrative services for a fee of 10 of the gross revenue of such oil and gas
operations. The agreement may be terminated by either party upon sixty days notice. 

. At September 30, 2024, the Company has not experienced losses with respect to its bank balances
in excess of government provided insurance. Management believes that no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to
these cash balances at September 30, 2024. 

at September 30, 2024. The note bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR at the end of each calendar quarter at September 30, 2024) and is due at . 

million, which expires between 2024 and 2039. 

The Company has no assurance as to if and when the benefit of NOL carryforwards
will be realized, therefore, a valuation allowance on the related deferred tax assets has been recorded. 

Forms 1120, U.S, Corporation Income Tax Returns are subject
to examination, by the IRS, generally for three years after they are filed.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company s discussion and analysis of its financial
condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain of the Company s accounting
policies require the application of judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By
their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments and estimates are based upon
the Company s historical experience, current trends and information available from other sources that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. 

The Company s significant accounting policies are summarized
in Note C to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K. The Company believes the following critical
accounting policies are more significant to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Revisions
in such estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known. 

Doubtful Accounts 

The Company s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and
notes receivable is based on an analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts. The analysis places particular emphasis
on past due accounts. Management considers such information as the nature and age of the receivable, the payment history of
the tenant, customer or other debtor and the financial condition of the tenant or other debtor. Management s estimate
of the required allowance, which is reviewed on a quarterly basis, is subject to revision as these factors change. 

Deferred Tax Assets 

Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision
for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. The
future recoverability of the Company s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income prior to
the expiration of the loss carry forwards. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a deferred tax asset due to tax deductions
available to it in future years. However, as management could not determine that it was more likely than not that the benefit
of the deferred tax asset would be realized, a 100 valuation allowance was established. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had current assets of 456,000 and
current liabilities of 61,000. 

Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were 430,000 as compared
to 447,000 at December 31, 2023. 

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the
same period in 2023 

The Company reported a net loss of 4,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, as compared to net income of 7,000 for the similar period in 2023. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 the Company had revenue
of 37,000 including 26,000 for rental revenue and 11,000 for management fees as compared to revenue of 35,000 including 25,000 for
rental revenue and 10,000 for management fees for the comparative period in 2023. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, corporate general 
administrative expenses were 79,000 as compared to 70,000 for the comparable period in 2023. 

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the
same period in 2023 

The Company reported net income of 1,000 for nine months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to net income of 18,000 for the similar period in 2023.

 Table of Contents 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company had revenue
of 110,000 including 76,000 for rental revenue and 34,000 for management fees as compared to revenue of 115,000 including 76,000
for rental revenue and 39,000 for management fees for the comparative period in 2023. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, corporate general 
administrative expenses were 235,000 as compared to 219,000 for the comparable period in 2023. 

Forward Looking Statements 

Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995: A number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this filing that are not historical or current facts
deal with potential future circumstances, operations and prospects. The discussion of such matters and subject areas is qualified
by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally, and also may materially differ from the Company s
actual future experience involving any one or more of such matters and subject areas relating to interest rate fluctuations, the ability
to obtain adequate debt and equity financing, demand, pricing, competition, construction, licensing, permitting, construction delays on
new developments, contractual and licensure, and other delays on the disposition, transition, or restructuring of currently or previously
owned, leased or managed properties in the Company s portfolio, and the ability of the Company to continue managing its costs and
cash flow while maintaining high occupancy rates and market rate charges in its retirement community. The Company has attempted
to identify, in context, certain of the factors that it currently believes may cause actual future experience and results to differ from
the Company s current expectations regarding the relevant matter of subject area. These and other risks and uncertainties
are detailed in the Company s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), including the Company s
Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 

Inflation 

The Company s principal source of revenue is rent fees for services
rendered and interest income. Although the Company has not historically experienced any adverse effects of inflation on salaries
or other operating expenses, there can be no assurance that such trends will continue. 

Environmental Matters 

The Company has conducted environmental assessments on most of its
existing owned or leased properties. These assessments have not revealed any environmental liability that the Company believes
would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, assets or results of operations. The Company is not aware
of any such environmental liability. The Company believes that all of its property is in compliance in all material respects
with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. The
Company has not been notified by any governmental authority and is not otherwise aware of any material non-compliance, liability or claim
relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of its communities. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk 

Interest Rate Risk 

The Company has extinguished all its outstanding debt therefore, the
Company has minimal risk from exposure to changes in interest rates. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a) Based
on an evaluation by our management (with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer), as of
the end of the period covered by this report, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). Were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

(b) There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the most
recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
