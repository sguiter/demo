million, and the Company had working capital in addition to unrestricted cash of 
million. The Company recorded a net loss of 
million and net income of 
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net (loss) income includes non-cash
stock-based compensation of 
million and 
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Historically,
the Company has generally had positive cash flows from operating activities and has relied on a combination of cash flows provided
by operations and the incurrence of debt and/or the refinancing of existing debt to fund its obligations. Cash flows provided by
operations amounted to 
million and 
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Management
currently believes that the Company s cash balances on hand, cash flows expected to be generated from operations, ability to control
and defer capital projects and amounts available from the Company s external borrowings will be sufficient to fund the Company s
net cash requirements through November 2025.

Revenue
recognized that was included in the deferred income balance at the beginning of the periods amounted to million and million,
as restated, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

For
the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, there was no significant amounts of revenue recognized as a result of changes
in contract transaction price related to performance obligations that were satisfied in the respective prior periods. 

Transaction
Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations 

At
September 30, 2024, the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts expected to be greater than
one year, or performance obligations for which we do not have a right to consideration from the customer in the amount that corresponds
to the value to the customer for our performance completed to date, variable consideration which is not accounted for in accordance with
the sales-based or usage-based royalties guidance, or contracts which are not wholly unperformed, was approximately million. Of
this amount, we expect to recognize as revenue approximately through December 31, 2024, approximately through December 31, 2026,
and the remaining through December 31, 2030. 

million million) of Senior Secured Notes and million of capitalized debt fees which are being
amortized over the length of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and are fully
repayable on June 1, 2026. 

Under
our debt facilities in place as of September 30, 2024, we were not subject to covenant testing on our senior secured notes (the Senior
Secured Notes ). We are, however, subject to covenant testing at the level of Inspired Entertainment Inc., the ultimate holding
company, on our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the RCF Agreement which required the Company to maintain a maximum
consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio of 6.0x on March 31, 2022, stepping down to 5.75x on March 31, 2023 and 5.50x from March
31, 2024 and thereafter (the RCF Financial Covenant ). The RCF Financial Covenant is calculated as the ratio of consolidated
senior secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (defined as net loss excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense,
interest income and income tax expense) for the 12-month period preceding the relevant quarterly testing date and is tested quarterly
on a rolling basis, subject to the Initial Facility (as defined in the RCF Agreement) being drawn on the relevant test date. The RCF
Financial Covenant does not include a minimum interest coverage ratio or other financial covenants. Covenant testing at September 30,
2024 showed covenant compliance with a net leverage of 3.1x. 

There
were no covenant violations in the period ended September 30, 2024. 

The
Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes contains covenants and certain reporting requirements including the requirement to provide
the lender, within 60 days after the close of the quarter, unaudited quarterly financial statements with footnote disclosures. In the
period ended September 30, 2023, the Company was unable to comply with this requirement due to the requirement to restate previously
reported financial statements as reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 8, 2023. The debt agreement
allows the Company a 30-day grace period to provide such financial information once they receive any notice of non-compliance. No such
notice was received. Concurrent with the filing of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023 with the SEC on February 27, 2024, the reporting requirement was met.

In
connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, and the entry into the RCF Agreement, on May 19, 2021, the Company terminated
all of its interest rate swaps. Accordingly, hedge accounting is no longer applicable. The amounts previously recorded in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income were amortized into Interest expense over the terms of the hedged forecasted interest payments. Losses reclassified
from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Income for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 amounted to million and million, respectively.

The

The
Company recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.
We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to
support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. However, given our current earnings and anticipated future
earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that sufficient positive evidence may become
available to allow us to reach a conclusion that a significant portion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release
of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for
the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on
the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. Our actual future results could differ materially from the historical results discussed below. Factors that
could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those referenced in the section
titled Risk Factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with
the SEC on April 15, 2024. 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

We
make forward-looking statements in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
For definitions of the term Forward-Looking Statements, see the definitions provided in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements at the forepart of this report. 

Seasonality 

Our
results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. Sales of our gaming machines can vary quarter on quarter
due to both supply and demand factors. Player activity for our holiday parks is generally higher in the second and third quarters of
the year, particularly during the summer months and slower during the first and fourth quarters of the year. 

Revenue 

We
generate revenue in four principal ways: i) on a participation basis, ii) on a fixed rental fee basis, iii) through product sales and
iv) through software license fees. Participation revenue generally includes a right to receive a share of our customers gaming
revenue, typically as a share of net win but sometimes as a share of the handle or coin in which represents the total amount
wagered. 

Geographic
Range 

Geographically,
the majority of our revenue is derived from, and the majority of our non-current assets are attributable to, our UK operations. The remainder
of our revenue is derived from, and non-current assets attributable to, Greece and the rest of the world (including North America). 

For
the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, we derived approximately 77 and 76 of our revenue from the UK (including customers
headquartered in the UK but whose revenue is generated globally), respectively, 7 (in both periods) from Greece, and the
remaining 16 and 17 respectively across the rest of the world. For the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023, we derived approximately
82 and 79 of our revenue from the UK (including customers headquartered in the UK but whose revenue is generated globally), respectively,
5 and 7 from Greece, respectively, and the remaining 13 and 14 respectively across the rest of the world. The UK percentage was impacted
by specific Hardware sales, which generally result in a lower margin Low Margin sales ), which contributed UK revenues for
the three-month period by 39 and for the nine-month period by 16 . 

As
of September 30, 2024, our non-current assets (excluding goodwill) were attributable as follows: 74 to the UK, 9 to Greece and 17 
across the rest of the world. As of September 30, 2023, our non-current assets (excluding goodwill) were attributable as follows: 71 
to the UK, 11 to Greece and 18 across the rest of the world. 

15 

Foreign
Exchange 

Our
results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the translation of foreign functional currencies into
our reporting currency and the re-measurement of foreign currency transactions and balances. The impact of foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations represents the difference between current rates and prior-period rates applied to current activity. The geographic
region in which the largest portion of our business is operated is the UK and the British pound GBP is considered to
be our functional currency. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar USD ). Our results are translated from our functional
currency of GBP into the reporting currency of USD using average rates for profit and loss transactions and applicable spot rates for
period-end balances. The effect of translating our functional currency into our reporting currency, as well as translating the results
of foreign subsidiaries that have a different functional currency into our functional currency, is reported separately in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income. 

During
the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, we derived approximately 23 and 24 of our revenue from sales to customers outside
the UK, respectively (see caveat above), compared to 18 and 21 during the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

In
the section Results of Operations below, currency impacts shown have been calculated as the current-period average GBP:USD
rate less the equivalent average rate in the prior year period, multiplied by the current period amount in our functional currency (GBP).
The remaining difference, referred to as functional currency at constant rate, is calculated as the difference in our functional currency,
multiplied by the prior-period average GBP:USD rate. This is not a U.S. GAAP measure but is one which management believes gives a clearer
indication of results. In the tables below, variances in particular line items from period to period exclude currency translation movements,
and currency translation impacts are shown independently. 

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

We
use certain financial measures that are not compliant with U.S. GAAP Non-GAAP financial measures ), including EBITDA and
adjusted EBITDA, to analyze our operating performance. In this discussion and analysis, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures,
define and explain these measures and provide reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures. See Non-GAAP Financial
Measures below. 

Results
of Operations 

Our
results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily between our functional currency (GBP) and our reporting
currency (USD). During the periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the average GBP:USD rates for the three-month period
were 1.30 and 1.27, respectively, and for the nine-month period were 1.28 and 1.25, respectively. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our results of operations has been organized in the following manner: 

a
 discussion and analysis of the Company s results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024,
 compared to the same period in 2023; and 

a
 discussion and analysis of the results of operations for each of the Company s segments (Gaming, Virtual Sports, Interactive
 and Leisure) for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, including key performance
 indicator KPI analysis. 

In
the discussion and analysis below, certain data may vary from the amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements due to rounding. 

For
all reported variances, refer to the overall company and segment tables shown below. All variances discussed in the overall company and
segment results are on a functional currency (at constant rate) basis, which excludes the impact of any changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. 

Key
Events for the Quarter 

During
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 in the Gaming segment, OPAP in Greece ordered 4,000 new VLT s, expected delivery in country is for 2,400 in H1 2025, with the final balance of 1,600 in Q4 2025 . 

During
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 we joined the Scientific Games Content Hub Partner Program, the global lottery
industry s premier content delivery platform, enabling Inspired to distribute to Scientific Games iLottery customers around
the world. 

During
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 the Interactive segment went live with seventeen new operators. The total number of customers
at the end of the period increased by twelve overall due to the closure of several smaller-scale customers. 

Key
agreements made in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 include a contract with Mecca Bingo
for the provision of gaming machines, including the installation of 150 terminals with expected deployment in the
fourth quarter of 2024 and a five-year machine supply
agreement with Carlton Bingo, both in the Leisure segment.

Revenue
(for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023) 

Consolidated
Reported Revenue by Segment 

There
 were no Low Margin-related sales for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine-months ended September
 30, 2023 Low Margin-related sales were 22.7 million and 27.1 million, respectively. 

For
the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, revenue on a functional currency (at constant rate) basis decreased by 21.5 million
and 30.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. 

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, Gaming revenue declined by 22.4 million predominantly due to a decrease in product
sales of 22.8 million, of which 22.7 million were Low Margin sales. Gaming service revenue grew by 0.4 million predominately due
to growth in North America and a customer bonus included the UK. Virtual Sports revenue declined by 2.5 million, with 2.2 million of the reduction from Online.
Interactive revenue grew by 2.7 million with growth driven in the UK and North American markets. Leisure revenue grew by 0.7
million, predominately driven by growth in the Holiday Parks and Motorway Service Area sectors. 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Gaming revenue declined by 30.6 million predominantly due to a decrease
in product sales of 26.5 million, of which 27.1 million were Low Margin sales. Gaming service revenue declined by 4.1 million,
predominately due to declines in the UK, mainland Europe and Greece. Virtual Sports declined by 9.0 million, with 8.7 million of
the reduction coming from Online. Interactive revenue grew by 7.2 million, which was driven by growth in the UK, mainland Europe
and North America. Leisure grew by 2.2 million, predominantly driven by growth in the Holiday Parks and Pubs sectors. 

18 

Cost
of Sales, excluding depreciation and amortization 

Cost
of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 25.7 million
and 31.6 million, respectively, or 53 and 32 respectively. The decreases were driven by 24.2 million and 28.9 million
decreases in cost of product, respectively, predominately driven by the decrease in low margin product sales. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative SG A expenses for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 5.5
million and 15.1 million, respectively, or 23 and 21 , respectively. 

The
increase during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by an increase in exceptional items of 4.0
million predominantly due to the costs of the restatement of our prior financial statements and the costs of group restructuring, along with increases in IT costs of
 0.7 million and storage and distribution costs of 0.5 million 

The
increase during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by the 10.6 million costs of the restatement of our
prior financial statements, an increase in non-staff costs of 4.6 million, predominantly driven by increases in storage and distribution,
IT and facility costs 

Stock-based
compensation 

During
the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded expenses of 1.8 million and 5.7 million, respectively, compared
to expenses of 3.3 million and 9.3 million for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023. All expenses were related to outstanding
awards but the nine-months ended September 30, 2023, included 0.4 million related to award units that were fully vested on the date
of grant and therefore were expensed immediately and also included 0.7 million related to the costs of the restatement of our prior
financial statements. 

Depreciation
and amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.7 million driven mainly by an increase
in Virtual Sports of 0.5 million for increased software development 

Depreciation
and amortization for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.2 million driven by increases in Virtuals of
 2.2 million and Interactive of 1.4 million for increased software development and intangible assets, offset by reductions in
Gaming of 1.8 million and Leisure of 0.2 million as machine assets unwind. 

19 

Net
operating income / Net income / (Loss) 

During
the three and nine-month period ended September 30,2024, net operating income was 11.9 million and 19.9 million, respectively, representing
declines of 0.4 million and 11.1 million, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. For the three-month period
ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was primarily driven by the increase in SG A and depreciation and amortization,
partially offset by increase in gross margin and reduction in stock-based compensation. For the nine-month period ended September 30,
2024, the decrease was primarily driven by the increase in SG A and expenses partially offset by the increase in gross
margin and reduction in stock-based compensation. 

For
the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, net income / (loss) was 3.4 million and (0.3) million, respectively,
compared to net income of 3.4 million and 7.6 million, respectively, in the prior year periods. 

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the increase was primarily driven by the decrease in income tax expense,
partially offset by the decrease in net operating income and increase in interest expense. 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in net operating income, partially
offset by decreases in interest expense and income tax expense. 

Deferred
Tax 

The
Company recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of both September 30, 2024 and 2023. We intend to continue
maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or
some portion of these allowances. However, given our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable
possibility that within the next six months, sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that
a significant portion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition
of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing
and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually
achieve. 

Segment
Results for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023) 

Gaming 

We
generate revenue from our Gaming segment through delivery of our gaming terminals preloaded with proprietary gaming software, server-based
content, as well as services such as terminal repairs, maintenance, software upgrades and upgrades on a when and if available basis and
content development. We receive rental fees for machines, typically in conjunction with long-term contracts, on both a participation
and fixed fee basis. Our participation contracts are typically structured to pay us a percentage of net win (defined as net revenue to
our operator customers, after deducting player winnings, free bets or plays and any relevant regulatory levies) from gaming terminals
placed in our customers facilities. Typically, we recognize revenue from these arrangements on a daily basis over the term of
the contract. 

Revenue
growth for our Gaming business is principally driven by changes in (i) the number of operator customers we have, (ii) the number of Gaming
machines in operation, (iii) the net win performance of the machines and (iv) the net win percentage that we receive pursuant to our
contracts with our customers.

 all SBG terminals in which the Company takes a participation revenue share across all territories. 

(2)
 
 Includes
 circa 2,500 of lottery terminals where the share is on handle instead of net win. 

In
the table above: 

End
of Period Installed Base is equal to the number of deployed Gaming terminals at the end of each period that have been placed on
a participation or fixed rental basis. Gaming participation revenue, which comprises the majority of Gaming Service revenue, is directly
related to the participation terminal installed base. This is the medium by which our customers generate revenue and distribute a revenue
share to the Company. To the extent all other KPIs and certain other factors remain constant, the larger the installed base, the higher
the Company s revenue would be for a given period. Management gives careful consideration to this KPI in terms of driving growth
across the segment. This does not include Service Only terminals. 

21 

Revenue
is derived from the performance of the installed base as described by the Gross and Net Win KPIs. 

If
the End of Period Installed Base is materially different from the Average Installed Base (described below), we believe this gives an
indication as to potential future performance. We believe the End of Period Installed Base is particularly useful for assessing new customers
or markets, to indicate the progress being made with respect to entering new territories or jurisdictions. 

Total
Gaming - Average Installed Base is the average number of deployed Gaming terminals during the period consisting of both participation
terminals and fixed rental terminals. Therefore, it is more closely aligned to revenue in the period. We believe this measure is particularly
useful for assessing existing customers or markets to provide comparisons of historical size and performance. This does not include Service
Only terminals. 

Participation
- Average Installed Base is the average number of deployed Gaming terminals that generated revenue on a participation basis. 

Fixed
Rental - Average Installed Base is the average number of deployed Gaming terminals that generated revenue on a fixed rental basis. 

Service
Only - Average Installed Base is the average number of terminals that generated revenue on a service only basis. 

Customer
Gross Win per unit per day is a KPI used by our management to (i) assess impact on the Company s revenue, (ii) determine
changes in the performance of the overall market and (iii) evaluate the impacts of regulatory change and our new content releases on
our customers. Customer Gross Win per unit per day is the average per unit cash generated across all Gaming terminals in which the Company
takes a participation revenue share across all territories in the period, defined as the difference between the amounts staked less winnings
to players divided by the Average Installed Base in the period, then divided by the number of days in the period. 

Gaming
revenue accrued in the period is derived from Customer Gross Win accrued in the period after deducting gaming taxes (defined as a regulatory
levy paid by the Customer to government bodies) and applying the Company s contractual revenue share percentage. 

Our
management believes Customer Gross Win measures are meaningful because they represent a view of customer operating performance that is
unaffected by our revenue share percentage and allow management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical comparisons
and benchmarking between customers and (3) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different markets in which we
operate. 

Customer
Net Win per unit per day is Customer Gross Win per unit per day after giving effect to the deduction of gaming taxes. 

Inspired
Blended Participation Rate is the Company s average revenue share percentage across all participation terminals where revenue
is earned on a participation basis, weighted by Customer Net Win per unit per day. 

Inspired
Fixed Rental Revenue per Gaming Machine per week is the Company s average fixed rental amount across all fixed rental terminals
where revenue is generated on a fixed fee basis, per unit per week. 

Inspired
Service Rental Revenue per Gaming Machine per week is the Company s average service rental amount across all service only
rental terminals where revenue is generated on a service only fixed fee basis, per unit per week. 

Gaming
Long term license amortization is the upfront license fee per terminal which is typically spread over the life of the terminal. 

22 

Our
overall Gaming revenue from terminals placed on a participation basis can therefore be calculated as the product of the Participation
- Average Installed Base, the Customer Net Win per unit per day, the number of days in the period, and the Inspired Blended Participation
Rate, which is equal to Participation Revenue . 

Number
of Machine sales is the number of terminals sold during the period. 

Average
selling price per terminal is the total revenue in GBP of the Gaming terminals sold divided by the number of Machine sales .

Gaming
Revenue 

During
the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, Gaming revenue decreased by 22.4 million and 30.6 million, respectively.
This was driven by decreases in Product revenue of 22.8 million and 26.5 million, respectively. Gaming service revenue increased by
 0.4 million and decreased by 4.1 million, respectively. 

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 the increase in Gaming Service revenue was driven by higher revenue from North America of 0.7 million due to increased game pack subscriptions
and UK LBO of 0.5 million
as the current year period included a customer bonus not included in the prior year period. 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 the decrease in Gaming Service revenue was driven by decreases of 2.1 million in the
UK market inclusive of shop closures in UK LBO and 1.1 million in the Greek market, primarily due to the reduction in Gross Win per
day and expiry of historical amortized license revenues. 

For
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 the decrease in Gaming Product revenue was primarily driven by lower UK Product sales
of 22.8 million, of which 22.7 million were Low Margin sales. 

For
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 the decrease in Gaming Product revenue was primarily driven by lower UK Product sales
of 26.5 million, of which 27.1 million were Low Margin sales. 

25 

Gaming
Operating Income 

Net
income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.6 million and decreased by 0.8 million respectively. 

The
three-month ended September 30, 2024 increase was primarily due to higher gross margin (as the 22.4 million revenue decrease was offset
by a 24.9 million decrease in total cost of sales mainly driven by the decrease in Low Margin sales in the current period). 

The
decrease during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization of
 1.8 million due to unwind of machine assets and stock-based compensation of 0.6 million, offset by an increase in
SG A costs of 3.5 million driven by increased staff cost, reduced overhead recoveries along with the cost of group restructuring not incurred
in the prior year period. 

Virtual
Sports 

We
generate revenue from our Virtual Sports segment through the on-premise solution and hosting of our products. We primarily receive fees
on a participation basis. Our participation contracts are typically structured to pay us a percentage of net win (defined as net revenue
to our operator customers, after deducting player winnings, free bets or plays and other promotional costs and any relevant regulatory
levies) from Virtual Sports content placed on our customers websites or in our customers facilities. Typically, we recognize
revenue from these arrangements on a daily basis over the term of the contract. 

Revenue
growth for our Virtual Sports segment is principally driven by the number of customers we have, the net win performance of the games
and the net win percentage that we receive pursuant to our contracts with our customers.

Virtual
Sports revenue 

During
the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 revenue decreased by 2.5 million and 8.9 million, or 19 and 21 , respectively.
These decreases were driven by 2.2 million and 8.7 million declines in Online Virtuals, respectively, primarily driven by a major customer
optimizing their customer base. 

Virtual
Sports operating income 

During
the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 net operating income decreased by 3.4 million and 11.2 million,
respectively. These decreases were driven by the declines in revenue and increases in depreciation and amortization of 0.5 million and
 2.2 million, respectively. 

Interactive 

We
generate revenue from our Interactive segment through the various games and content made available via third party aggregation platforms
with Inspired s remote gaming server or directly on the Customers remote gaming server platform, and services such as customer
support, platform maintenance, updates and upgrades. Typically, we receive fees on a participation basis. Our participation contracts
are usually structured to pay us a percentage of net win (defined as net revenue to our operator customers, after deducting player winnings,
free bets or plays and other promotional costs and any relevant regulatory levies) from Interactive content placed on our customers 
websites. Typically, we recognize revenue from these arrangements on a daily basis over the term of the contract. 

Revenue
growth for our Interactive segment is principally driven by the number of customers we have, the number of live games, the net win performance
of the games and the net win percentage that we receive pursuant to our contracts with our customers.

Interactive
revenue 

During
the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, revenue increased by 2.7 million and 7.2 million, or 37 and 36 ,
respectively, primarily driven by revenue growth in the UK, North America and mainland Europe due to new customer launches, the
consistent launch of new content across the estate and increased promotional activity through exclusive deals with tier-one
customers. 

Interactive
operating income 

Operating
income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.7 million and 4.3 million, respectively. This increase
was primarily driven by the increase in gross margin, partially offset by increases in SG A expenses, driven by increased IT costs,
lower labor capitalization and higher depreciation and amortization. 

30 

Leisure 

We
typically generate revenue from our Leisure segment through the supply of our gaming and amusement machines. We receive rental fees for
machines, typically on a long-term contract basis, on both a participation and fixed fee basis. Our participation contracts are usually
structured to pay us a percentage of net win (defined as net revenue to our operator customers, after deducting player winnings, free
bets or plays, any relevant regulatory levies and minimum fixed incomes where applicable) from machines placed in our customers 
facilities. We generally recognize revenue from these arrangements on a daily basis over the term of the contract. 

Revenue
growth for our Leisure segment is principally driven by the number of customers we have, the number of machines in operation, the net
win performance of the machines and the net win percentage that we receive pursuant to our contracts with our customers.

32 

Leisure
Revenue 

For
the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 revenue increased by 0.7 million and 2.2 million or 2 and 3 , respectively.
These increases were primarily due to increased service revenue of 0.6 million and 2.0 million, respectively, predominately due to
the increase in Holiday Parks of 0.2 million and 1.3 million driven by the addition of a new site as well as growth in existing sites,
along with growth in MSA of 0.3 million and 0.3 million, respectively. 

Leisure
Operating Income 

Operating
income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.4 million and 2.4 million, respectively. This was
primarily due to the increases in gross margin, partially offset by increases in SG A expenses of 0.4 million and 1.5 million,
respectively, driven by the increase in seasonal staff, the increase in national living wage and salary increases, along with increases
in facility costs. 

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

We
use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, to analyze our operating performance. We use these financial measures to manage
our business on a day-to-day basis. We believe that these measures are also commonly used in our industry to measure performance. For
these reasons, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide expanded insight into our business, in addition to standard
U.S. GAAP financial measures. There are no specific rules or regulations for defining and using non-GAAP financial measures, and as a
result the measures we use may not be comparable to measures used by other companies, even if they have similar labels. The presentation
of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information
prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. You should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with our U.S.
GAAP financial measures. 

We
define our non-GAAP financial measures as follows: 

EBITDA
 is defined as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income tax expense. 

Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income
tax expense, and other additional exclusions and adjustments (see Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table). Such additional excluded amounts
include stock-based compensation U.S. GAAP charges where the associated liability is expected to be settled in stock, and changes in
the value of earnout liabilities and income and expenditure in relation to legacy portions of the business (being those portions where
trading no longer occurs) including closed defined benefit pension schemes. Additional adjustments are made for items considered outside
the normal course of business, including but not limited to (1) restructuring costs, which include charges attributable to employee severance,
impairments, management changes, restructuring, dual running costs, costs related to facility closures and integration costs, (2) merger
and acquisition costs and (3) gains or losses not in the ordinary course of business. 

We
believe Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a particularly useful performance measure, because
it focuses on certain operating drivers of the business, including sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense
and other operating income and expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can provide a more complete understanding of our operating results
and the trends to which we are subject, and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future.
Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income or loss,
because it does not take into account certain aspects of our operating performance (for example, it excludes non-recurring gains and
losses which are not deemed to be a normal part of underlying business activities). Our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable
to the use by other companies of similarly termed measures. Management compensates for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA as
only one of several measures for evaluating our operating performance. In addition, capital expenditures, which affect depreciation and
amortization, interest expense, and income tax benefit (expense), are evaluated separately by management. 

33 

Adjusted
Revenue (Revenue Excluding Low Margin Gaming Hardware Sales) is defined as revenue excluding Gaming hardware sales that are sold
at Low Margin with the intention of securing longer term recurring revenue streams. 

Functional
Currency at Constant rate. Currency impacts discussed have been calculated as the current-period average GBP: USD rate less the
equivalent average rate in the prior period, multiplied by the current period amount in our functional currency (GBP). The remaining
difference, referred to as functional currency at constant rate, is calculated as the difference in our functional currency, multiplied
by the prior-period average GBP: USD rate, as a proxy for functional currency at constant rate movement. 

Currency
Movement represents the difference between the results in our reporting currency (USD) and the results on a functional currency
(at constant rate) basis. 

Reconciliations
from net loss, as shown in our Consolidates Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), to Adjusted EBITDA are shown below:

Notes
to Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation tables above: 

(1) 
 Pension
 charges are profit and loss charges included within selling, general and administrative expenses, relating to a defined benefit
 scheme which was closed to new entrants in 1999 and to future accrual in 2010. As well as the amortization of net loss, the figure
 also includes charges relating to the Pension Protection Fund (which were historically borne by the pension scheme) and a small amount
 of associated professional services expenses. These costs are included within Corporate Functions. 

(2) 
 Costs
 of Group Restructure includes redundancy costs, Payments In Lieu of Notice costs and any associated employer taxes. To qualify
 as being an adjusting item, costs must be part of a large restructuring project, which will net save ongoing future costs or be in
 relation to the exit of an Executive. 

(3) 
 Costs
 of group Restatement includes accounting advice associated with the restatement of the 2020, 2021 and 2022 annual accounts
 and the 2023 Q1 and Q2 interim accounts. To qualify as being an adjusting item, costs must be specific to the event and be neither
 normal nor recurring in nature. 

(4) 
 Stock-based
 compensation expense, Depreciation and amortization, Total other expense, net and Income tax are described above in the Results of
 Operations line item discussions. Total expense, net includes interest income, interest expense, change in fair value of earnout
 liability, change in fair value of derivative liability and other finance income. 

(5) 
 Exchange
 rate in the table is calculated by dividing the USD Adjusted EBITDA by the GBP Adjusted EBITDA, therefore this could be slightly
 different from the average rate during the period depending on timing of transactions. 

(6) 
 Profit
 on disposal of trade assets In January 2022, the Company sold its Italian VLT business, including all terminals
 and other assets, staff costs and facilities and contracts to a non-connected party, recognizing a profit on this disposal.

Reconciliation

We
believe that accounting for low margin hardware sales in conformance with U.S. GAAP can result in a distorted presentation of our revenue
and growth. Therefore, we use Revenue Excluding Low Margin Sales, or Adjusted Revenue, to internally analyze our operating performance.

Net
cash provided by operating activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash inflow provided by operating activities was 24.8 million, compared to a 43.0 million
inflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a 18.2 million decrease in cash generation from operating activities.
The decrease was driven primarily due to trading levels and working capital timing. 

Change
in fair value of derivative liabilities and stock-based compensation expense decreased by 4.1 million to 5.7 million due to a 3.6
million reduction in the stock-based compensation expense and a 0.5 million reduction in the recycling of the terminated currency swaps
which ended on September 30, 2023. 

Depreciation
and amortization increased by 2.5 million, to 35.1 million, with increases of 1.4 million for intangible assets and 1.1 million
for contract costs. 

Other
net cash utilized by operating activities increased by 8.4 million, to a 16.4 million outflow. The relative movements between the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted in adverse movements in accounts payable and
accruals of 12.5 million and accounts receivable of 16.1 million, both figures impacted by timing of deals and the relative levels
of manufacturing activity. These were partly offset by favorable movements in inventory 11.7 million, payroll and business taxes 5.5
million and prepayments 2.0 million. 

36 

Net
cash used in investing activities 

Net
cash utilized in investing activities decreased by 9.9 million, to 29.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
This was driven by an 8.4 million decrease in plant, property and equipment, a 1.9 million decrease in capitalized software
spend and a 0.9 million increase in contract cost additions. The prior period also included the acquisition of Lot.to for 0.6 million. 

Net
cash used by financing activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used by financing activities was 0.4 million relating to finance lease spend. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash utilized by financing activities was 2.6 million, with 1.0 million of finance lease
spend and 1.6 million on share repurchases. 

Funding
Needs and Sources 

To
fund our obligations, we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations and the incurrence of additional
debt or the refinancing of existing debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had liquidity consisting of 36.5 million in cash and cash equivalents
and a further 6.7 million of undrawn revolver facility. This compares to 26.4 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September
30, 2023, with a further 24.4 million of revolver facilities undrawn. We had a working capital outflow of 16.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an 8.0 million outflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
level of our working capital surplus or deficit varies with the level of machine production and procurement we are undertaking and our
capitalization as well as the seasonality evident in some of the businesses. In periods with minimal machine volumes and capital spend,
our working capital is typically more stable. In periods where significant numbers of machines are being produced or procured, the levels
of inventory and creditors are typically higher and there is a natural timing difference between converting the stock into sellable or
capitalized plant and settling payments to suppliers. These factors, along with movements in trading activity levels can result in significant
working capital volatility. In periods of low activity, our working capital volatility is reduced. Working capital is reviewed and managed
with the aim of ensuring that current liabilities are covered by the level of cash held and the expected level of short-term receipts. 

Some
of our business operations require cash to be held within the machines. As of September 30, 2024, 6.7 million of our 36.5 million of
cash and cash equivalents were held as operational floats within the machines. At September 30, 2023, 6.0 million of our 26.4 million
of cash and cash equivalents were held as operational floats within the machines 

Management
currently believes that the Company s cash balances on hand, cash flows expected to be generated from operations, and the ability
to control and defer capital projects will be sufficient to fund the Company s net cash requirements through November 2025.

Debt
Covenants 

Under
our debt facilities in place as of September 30, 2024, we are not subject to covenant testing on the Senior Secured Notes. We are, however,
subject to covenant testing at the level of Inspired Entertainment Inc., the ultimate holding company, on our Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility which requires the Company to maintain a maximum consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio of 6.0x on March 31,
2022, stepping down to 5.75x on March 31, 2023 and 5.50x from March 31, 2024 and thereafter (the RCF Financial Covenant ).
The RCF Financial Covenant is calculated as the ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (defined
as net loss excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income tax expense) for the 12-month period
preceding the relevant quarterly testing date and is tested quarterly on a rolling basis, subject to the Initial Facility (as defined
in the RCF Agreement) being drawn on the relevant test date. The RCF Financial Covenant does not include a minimum interest coverage
ratio or other financial covenants. Covenant testing at September 30, 2024 showed covenant compliance with a net leverage of 3.1x. 

The
Indenture contains covenants and certain reporting requirements including the requirement to provide the Lender, within 60 days after
the close of the quarter, unaudited quarterly financial statements with footnote disclosures. The Company was unable to comply with this
requirement as of September 30, 2023 due to the requirement to restate previously reported financial statements as reported in a Current
Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 8, 2023. The debt agreement allows the Company a 30-day grace period to provide such
financial information once they receive any notice of non-compliance. No such notice was received and concurrent with the filing of the
September 30,2023 10Q with the SEC on February 27, 2024, the reporting requirement was met. There were no other breaches of the debt
covenants in the periods. 

There
were no other breaches of the debt covenants in the periods ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. 

37 

Liens
and Encumbrances 

As
of September 30, 2024, our senior bank debt was secured by the imposition of a fixed and floating charge in favor of the lender over
all the assets of the Company and certain of the Company s subsidiaries. 

Share
Repurchases 

The
Board of Directors has authorized that the Company may use up to 25.0 million to repurchase Inspired shares of common stock,
subject to repurchases being effected on or before May 10, 2025. Management has discretion as to whether to repurchase shares of the
Company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 no shares were repurchased meaning the previous figure of an aggregate total spend of 12.0 million
in repurchasing our shares of common stock remains unchanged.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, promulgated
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.
We exercise considerable judgment with respect to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, our recognition of revenue and expenses, and our disclosure of commitments
and contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments.
We base our estimates and judgments on a variety of factors, including our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry
and current and expected economic conditions, that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We periodically
re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications
are necessary. While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting
policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise
of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates. 

38 

Revenue 

Application
of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements
with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. The Company
often enters into contracts with customers that consist of a combination of services and products that are accounted for as one or more
distinct performance obligations. Management applies judgment in evaluating the contractual terms and conditions that impact the identification
of performance obligations and the pattern of revenue recognition. For these arrangements that contain multiple promises, judgement is
also required to determine the stand-alone selling price SSP for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where
SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information
that may include market conditions, size of the customer, geography and other observable inputs or, as necessary, unobservable considerations
such as historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry and our current or expected selling practices. 

Revenue
recognition is also impacted by our ability to estimate variable consideration, including, for example, rebates, service-level penalties,
and other incentive payments. We consider various factors when making these judgments, including a review of specific transactions, historical
experience and market and economic conditions. Evaluations are conducted each quarter to assess the adequacy of the estimates. 

Other
significant judgments include determining whether the Company is acting as the principal or the agent in a transaction. 

The
Company recognized service and product revenue of 196.7 million and 20.0 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. The Company s revenue recognition policy, which requires significant judgments and estimates, is fully described in Note
1 Nature of Operations, Management s Plans and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 

Goodwill
Impairment Assessment 

In
accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected
to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on at least an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill
upon reorganization using a relative fair value allocation approach. We determined that we have five reporting units: Virtual Sports,
Interactive, Leisure, and two reporting units within our Gaming segment. As of September 30, 2024, total goodwill with the Virtual Sports,
Interactive, and two Gaming reporting units is 47.1 million, 1.9 million, 9.8 million, and 3.1 million, respectively. There is no
remaining goodwill within the Leisure reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment
or one level below an operating segment) annually on the last day of our fiscal period or between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events
or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition,
or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. 

Goodwill
is reviewed for impairment using either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative one-step process. If we perform a qualitative assessment
and determine that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.
For reporting units where we perform the quantitative test, we are required to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we
primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which
includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the
carrying value is higher than the fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the
reporting unit s estimated fair value. 

39 

Application
of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities
to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. Performance
of the qualitative goodwill assessment requires judgment in identifying and considering the significance of relevant key factors, events
and circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying amount of the reporting units. Such events and circumstances that we have considered
include macroeconomic conditions, industry specific and market considerations, and reporting unit-specific factors such as overall actual
and projected financial performance, among other factors. We also considered the results from the most recent date that a fair value
measurement was performed as a part of a quantitative goodwill assessment and specifically the cushion between each reporting unit s
fair value and carrying value. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit as a part of a quantitative goodwill
assessment change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and
assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment, if any, for each reporting unit. 

We
performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 using a qualitative assessment for all of our reporting units.
Based on the results of our qualitative impairment assessments, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of
each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values and there were no reporting units requiring further
assessment. 

Long-lived
Assets and Finite-lived Intangible Assets 

We
evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and other long-lived assets with finite useful lives by comparing the carrying value
of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows that we expect the asset to generate if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that these assets are not recoverable. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, an impairment loss is measured as the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow
approach where projections of future cash flows generated by those assets are discounted using an estimated discount rate. Significant
judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also
make judgments about the remaining useful lives of intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. While we believe
our estimates of future operating results and projected cash flows are reasonable, any significant adverse changes in key assumptions
(i.e., adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or expectation that, more likely than not,
an asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its useful life) or adverse changes in economic and market
conditions may cause a change in our evaluation of recoverability or our estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge
that could be material to our financial statements. Any impairment loss shall be allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a
pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset
of the group shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. 

Management
determined that there were no new indicators of impairment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the Company concluded
that there was no impairment of the Company s intangible and long-lived assets as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Software
Development Costs 

Software
development costs represent costs incurred to develop internal-use software, including software developed to deliver our cloud-based
offerings to customers, as well as external-use software to be used in the products we sell, lease or license to customers. Such costs
primarily consist of salaries and payroll related costs for employees and external contractors directly involved in the corresponding
software development efforts. We determine the appropriate guidance to apply to software development costs on a project-by-project basis,
based on the nature of the underlying software. 

40 

Certain
direct costs incurred to develop new internal-use software, as well as certain software enhancements that provide new functionality,
are capitalized once the project has been approved by management and is in the application development stage. 

Costs
incurred in the preliminary planning stage and the post implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred in
developing external-use software are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, after which costs are
capitalized up to the date the software is available for general release to customers. Technological feasibility is established upon
completion of a detailed program design or, in its absence, upon completion of a working model. 

The
Company must apply judgement in determining the amount of software development costs that should be capitalized. Specifically, we must
evaluate, on a project-by-project basis, whether the resultant product or platform will be completed and generate ongoing economic benefits,
principally through revenue from our customers, which is subject to uncertainties. 

Once
the software is substantially complete or available for general release, capitalized internal-use and external-use software costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful life of the software, which ranges from two to five years. There
is judgement involved in estimating the useful life of developed software and the two-to-five-year period was determined based on factors
such as the continuous development in the technology, obsolescence, and anticipated life of the service offering before significant upgrades.
Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on a recurring basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our
principal market risks are our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Interest
Rate Risk 

Following
the Company s refinancing of its debt in May 2021, the external borrowings of 235.0 million 315.2 million) are provided
at a fixed rate. Therefore, movements in rates such as LIBOR do not impact on the current borrowings and the only fluctuation that is
expected to be reported will be that solely caused by movements in the exchange rates between the Company s functional currency
and its reporting currency. 

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risk 

Our
operations are conducted in various countries around the world, and we receive revenue and pay expenses from these operations in a number
of different currencies. As such, our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated
in (i) currencies other than GBP, which is our functional currency, or (ii) the functional currencies of our subsidiaries, which is not
necessarily GBP. To estimate our foreign currency exchange rate risk, we identify material Euro and US Dollar trading and balance sheet
amounts and recalculate the result using a 10 movement in the GBP:US Dollar exchange rate. For the trading figures the 10 movement
is based on the average exchange rate throughout the reported period and for the balance sheet figures the 10 movement is based on the
exchange rate used at September 30, 2024. 

Excluding
intercompany balances, our Euro and US Dollar functional currency net assets total approximately 25.7 million and 13.0 million
respectively. We use a sensitivity analysis model to measure the impact of a 10 adverse movement of foreign currency exchange rates
against the US Dollar. A hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the Euro and the US Dollar relative to GBP as of September
30, 2024, would result in favorable translation adjustments of approximately 2.3 million and 1.3 million respectively, recorded in other comprehensive loss. 

Included
within our trading results are earnings outside of our functional currency. Retained gains from Euro based entities earned in Euros and
retained losses from USD based entities earned in US Dollars in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 9.6 million and
 14.4 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the Euro and the US Dollar relative to GBP as of September
30, 2024, would result in translation adjustments of approximately 0.9 million favorable and 1.3 million unfavorable, respectively,
recorded in trading operations. 

41 

The
majority of the Company s trading is in GBP, the functional currency, although the reporting currency of the Company is the US
Dollar. As such, changes in the GBP:USD exchange rate have an effect on the Company s results. A 10 weakening of GBP against the
US Dollar would change the trading operational results unfavorably by approximately 0.3 million and would result in unfavorable translation
adjustments of approximately 11.9 million, recorded in other comprehensive loss. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer
(together, the Certifying Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying
Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30,
2024, due to the material weaknesses described in Item 9A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024. Management is redesigning and implementing existing and additional controls to remediate
these material weaknesses. 

Notwithstanding
the identified material weaknesses and management s assessment that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at
the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, management believes that the interim consolidated financial statements and footnote
disclosures included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results
of operations, cash flows and disclosures as of and for the periods presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the control changes to remediate the identified material weaknesses, there were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our
business is subject to a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024. Any of these risks could materially
and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects, and cause the value of our common stock to decline,
which could cause investors in our common stock to lose all or part of their investments.
