 Credit Facility 
 
 On July 2, 2024, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Facility Agreement, which amended the Existing Credit Facility Agreement. Among other changes to the existing credit agreement, the Third Amendment established an incremental term loan in the stated principal amount of million (the New Term Loan ), which was fully drawn at closing and matures on July 2, 2027. The entire stated principal amount of the New Term Loan is due at maturity and there is no scheduled amortization prior to such date. Together with cash on hand, proceeds from the New Term Loan were used to repay an outstanding term loan under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement in the principal amount of million prior to its December 31, 2024 maturity date and to repay an aggregate principal amount of million of the Company s Series B Senior Notes due July 5, 2024 issued under that certain Note Purchase Agreement dated as of July 5, 2012. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the borrowing capacity available under our million multi-currency revolving credit facility, including outstanding letters of credit of million, was million. 
 
 Term Loan 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had million in borrowings under the New Term Loan which were classified as long-term. Please refer to Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments , for a discussion of the foreign currency hedge associated with the New Term Loan. 
 
 Pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements, we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios. In addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.

million and million. As of December 31, 2023 the notional amount of these forward exchange contracts was SGD million and million. We have also entered into forward exchange contracts, designated as fair value hedges, to manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates on cross-currency intercompany demand notes which were executed at various times throughout 2023 and 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the total notional amounts of these forward exchange contracts were Euro ("EUR") million and million . As of December 31, 2023, the total notional amounts of these forward exchange contracts were EUR million and SGD million. 
 
 In addition, we have entered into several foreign currency contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, for periods of up to , intended to hedge the currency risk associated with a portion of our forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies.

 In December 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap for million, which we designated as a hedge of our net investment in Daikyo. The cross-currency swap had an original maturity date of December 31, 2024, but was extinguished in July 2024. In July 2024, we entered into a new cross-currency swap for million, which we designated as a hedge of our net investment in Daikyo. As of September 30, 2024, the notional amount of the cross-currency swap is billion million) and the swap termination date is July 2, 2027. Under the cross-currency swap, we receive fixed USD interest rate payments in return for paying fixed JPY interest rate payments. 
 
 Additionally, we will periodically enter into forward exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates on assets and liabilities, other than the intercompany loans and demand notes referenced above, which are denominated in foreign currencies. The Company has elected not to designate these forward contracts in hedging relationships, and any change in the value of the contracts is recognized in income. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Many of our proprietary products are made from synthetic elastomers, which are derived from the petroleum refining process. We purchase the majority of our elastomers via long-term supply contracts, some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices. The following economic hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment since they did not meet the highly effective requirement at inception. 
 
 From November 2017 through September 2024, we purchased several series of call options for a total of barrels of crude oil to mitigate our exposure to such oil-based surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regard to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding contracts to purchase barrels of crude oil from September 2024 to March 2026, at a weighted-average strike price of per barrel.

Our Contract-Manufactured Products reportable segment serves as a fully integrated business, focused on the design, manufacture, and automated assembly of complex devices, primarily for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device customers. 
 
 The Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") evaluates the performance of our segments based upon, among other things, segment net sales and operating profit. Segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs, which include executive and director compensation, stock-based compensation, certain pension and other retirement benefit costs, and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments. Also excluded are items that the CODM considers not representative of ongoing operations. Such items are referred to as other unallocated items and generally include restructuring and related charges, certain asset impairments and other specifically-identified income or expense items. The segment operating profit metric is what the CODM uses in evaluating our results of operations and the financial measure that provides a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 The following discussion is intended to further the reader s understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of our Company. It should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q as well as Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our 2023 Annual Report. Our historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report and in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Throughout this section, references to Notes refer to the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, unless otherwise indicated. 
 
 Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 For the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year-over-year results, we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic net sales exclude the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures and translate the current-period reported sales of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than USD at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period. We may also refer to adjusted consolidated operating profit and adjusted consolidated operating profit margin, which exclude the effects of unallocated items. The unallocated items are not representative of ongoing operations, and generally include restructuring and related charges, certain asset impairments, and other specifically-identified income or expense items. The re-measured results excluding effects from currency translation, the impact from acquisitions and/or divestitures, and excluding the effects of unallocated items are not in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") and should not be used as a substitute for the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are incorporated in our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and believes that this information provides users with a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position.

This benefit was partially offset by 1.6 million of expense recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in connection with a plan to optimize the legal structure of the Company and its subsidiaries. The expense consists primarily of consulting fees, legal expenses, and other one-time costs directly attributable to this plan. Restructuring and other charges of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represent the net impact of an inventory write down of 0.9 million within cost of goods and services sold and a 0.8 million benefit within other expense (income) for revised severance estimates in connection with its 2022 restructuring plan. 
 
 (2) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recorded 0.2 million and 0.6 million , respectively, of amortization expense within operating profit associated with an intangible asset acquired during the second quarter of 2020.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 We evaluate the performance of our segments based upon, among other things, segment net sales and operating profit. Segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs, which include executive and director compensation, stock-based compensation, certain pension and other retirement benefit costs, and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments. Also excluded are items that we consider not representative of ongoing operations. Such items are referred to as other unallocated items for which further information can be found above in the reconciliation from U.S. GAAP to non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Percentages in the following tables and throughout the Results of Operations section may reflect rounding adjustments. 
 
 Net Sales

These reductions were partially offset by an increase in sales of self-injection device platforms, approximately 19 million in customer incentives in connection with volumes achieved during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, and increased sales prices. 
 
 Contract-Manufactured Products Contract-Manufactured Products net sales increased by 0.6 million, or 0.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, including a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 0.7 million. Excluding foreign currency translation effects, net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.1 million, or 0.1 , as compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to a decrease in sales of healthcare diagnostic devices, offset by growth in self-injection devices for obesity and diabetes.

 Interest Expense, Net and Interest Income 
 
 The following table presents interest expense, net, by significant component: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest expense 5.0 4.4 12.2 11.7 Capitalized interest (4.3) (1.5) (8.4) (3.9) Interest expense, net 0.7 2.9 3.8 7.8 Interest income (4.6) (8.8) (14.8) (18.6) 
 
 Interest expense, net, decreased by 2.2 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, and decreased by 4.0 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, due to an increase in capitalized interest. 
 
 Interest income decreased by 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, and decreased by 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to the Company having a lower average cash balance during 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023.

The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit related to stock-based compensation in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, partially offset by a shift in the forecasted geographic earnings mix.

 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 74.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decline in operating results, offset by favorable working capital management. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased by 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, due to an increase in capital expenditures for additional manufacturing capacity to meet future customer demand. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities increased by 283.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in purchases under our share repurchase program in 2024, as compared to 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures: 
 in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 490.9 853.9 Accounts receivable, net 524.3 512.0 Inventories 401.2 434.7 Accounts payable 224.3 242.4 Debt 202.6 206.8 Equity 2,752.1 2,881.0 Working capital 1,034.1 1,264.6 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased. Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents Our cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2024 consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in high-quality, short-term investments. The cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2024 included 80.3 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the U.S., and 410.6 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the U.S. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased 1,409,786 shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program at a cost of 506.5 million, or an average price of 359.24 per share. 
 
 Working capital Working capital at September 30, 2024 decreased by 230.5 million, or 18.2 , as compared to December 31, 2023, which includes a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 6.2 million . Excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, cash and cash equivalents, total current liabilities and inventories decreased by 365.0 million , 158.0 million and 34.0 million , respectively, while accounts receivable increased by 12.5 million. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to capital expenditures and share repurchases, offset by cash from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in total current liabilities was primarily due to the Company amending its Credit Facility Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As part of this amendment, all current notes payable and debt amounts were repaid. Please refer to Note 8, Debt , for further discussion. Additionally, a decline in accounts payable and the payout of the 2023 annual incentive plan accrual during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 contributed to the decrease in total current liabilities. 
 
 The decrease in inventories and the increase in accounts receivable were both due to increased net sales leading up to the September 30, 2024 balance sheet date as compared to the December 31, 2023 balance sheet date. 
 
 Debt and credit facilities The 4.2 million decrease in total debt at September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, is due to the net activity of debt repayments and borrowings as mentioned in Note 8, Debt . 
 
 Our sources of liquidity include our multi-currency revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the multi-currency revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2024, the borrowing capacity available under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, including outstanding letters of credit of 2.4 million, was 497.6 million. We do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds. 
 
 Pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements, we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and not to exceed established leverage ratios. In addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 
 
 We believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with availability under our multi-currency revolving credit facility, will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations. 
 
 Commitments and Contractual Obligations 
 
 A summary of future material cash payments resulting from commitments and contractual obligations was provided in our 2023 Annual Report. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our commitments and contractual obligations. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs, as noted in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 There have been no changes to the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosed in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Our disclosure and analysis in this Form 10-Q contains some forward-looking statements that are based on management s beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates and forecasts. We also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public, as well as oral forward-looking statements. Such statements provide our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have attempted, wherever possible, to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as plan, expect, believe, intend, will, estimate, continue and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations and financial performance, as well as our strategy for growth, product development, market position and expenditures. All statements that address operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future - including statements relating to sales and earnings per share growth, cash flows or uses, and statements expressing views about future operating results - are forward-looking statements. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. The forward-looking statements are, and will be, based on management s then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates. Investors should realize that, if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. 
 
 The following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements: 
 sales demand and our ability to meet that demand; 
 competition from other providers in our businesses, including customers in-house operations, and from lower-cost producers in emerging markets, which can impact unit volume, price and profitability; 
 customers changing inventory requirements and manufacturing plans that alter existing orders or ordering patterns for the products we supply to them; 
 interruptions or weaknesses in our supply chain, including from reasons beyond our control such as extreme weather, longer-term climate changes, natural disasters, pandemic, war, accidental damage, or unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems, which could cause delivery delays or restrict the availability of raw materials, key purchased components and finished products; 
 the timing, regulatory approval and commercial success of customer products that incorporate our products and systems; 
 whether customers agree to incorporate our products and delivery systems with their new and existing drug products, the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of those products and systems, which involves substantial evaluations of the functional, operational, clinical and economic viability of our products, and the rate, timing and success of regulatory approval for the drug products that incorporate our components and systems; 
 the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity, which is essential to conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of first commercialization of customers products in Crystal Zenith prefilled syringes; 
 profitability, or mix, of the products sold in any reporting period, including lower-than-expected sales growth of our high-value proprietary product offerings; 
 maintaining or improving production efficiencies and overhead absorption; 
 dependence on third-party suppliers and partners, some of which are single-source suppliers of critical materials and products, including our Japanese partner and affiliate, Daikyo; 
 the loss of key personnel or highly-skilled employees; 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 the availability and cost of skilled employees required to meet increased production, managerial, research and other needs, including professional employees and persons employed under collective bargaining agreements; 
 the successful and timely implementation of price increases necessary to offset rising production costs, including raw material prices, particularly petroleum-based raw materials; 
 the cost and progress of development, regulatory approval and marketing of new products; 
 our ability to obtain and maintain licenses in any jurisdiction in which we do business; 
 the relative strength of USD in relation to other currencies, particularly the Euro, SGD, the Danish Krone, Yen, Colombian Peso, Brazilian Real, and the South Korean Won; and 
 the potential adverse effects of global healthcare legislation on customer demand, product pricing and profitability. 
 
 This list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could affect our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all of the factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. For further discussion of these and other factors, see the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report as well as Part II, section 1A of this quarterly report. 
 
 Except as required by law or regulation, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
