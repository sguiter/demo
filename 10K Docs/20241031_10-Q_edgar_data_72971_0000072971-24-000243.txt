 (1) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. 
 (2) Includes provision for credit losses for loans, debt securities, and other financial assets. 
 (3) Book value per common share is common stockholders equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding. 
 (4) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable management, investors, and others to assess the Company s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures, see the Capital Management Tangible Common Equity section in this Report. 
 (5) Represents Wells Fargo net income divided by average assets. 
 (6) Represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to common stock divided by average common stockholders equity. 
 (7) The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
 (8) For additional information, see the Capital Management section and Note 22 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 (9) Represents TLAC divided by RWAs, which is our binding TLAC ratio, determined by using the greater of RWAs under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. 
 (10) Represents average high-quality liquid assets divided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule.

 Financial Review 
 Overview 
 Wells Fargo Company is a leading financial services company that has approximately 1.9 trillion in assets. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management. Wells Fargo ranked No. 34 on Fortune s 2024 rankings of America s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and third in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. banks at September 30, 2024. 
 Wells Fargo s top priority remains building a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other regulatory actions, some of which are described below. These regulatory actions may require the Company, among other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, products and services, and risk management practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple years, and we are likely to continue to experience issues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. We are also likely to continue to identify more issues as we implement our risk and control infrastructure, which may result in additional regulatory actions. Regulators have indicated the potential for escalating consequences for banks that do not timely resolve open issues or have repeat issues. Furthermore, issues or delays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on others. Failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis could result in additional fines, penalties, business restrictions, limitations on subsidiary capital distributions, increased capital or liquidity requirements, enforcement actions, and other adverse consequences, which could be significant. While we still have significant work to do and have not yet satisfied certain aspects of these regulatory actions, the Company is committed to devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in place. 
 
 Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational Risk Management 
 On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company s Board of Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company s compliance and operational risk management program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 

Company works to address the consent order provisions. The consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial third-party review of the enhancements and improvements provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete and the plans are adopted and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company s total consolidated assets as defined under the consent order will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. 
 
 Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
 On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of 1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the Company s compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company s internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The Company continues to work to address the provisions of the consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a 250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC s April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the Company s Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the CFPB modified its consent order to clarify how it would terminate. 

Wells Fargo Company 3 

Overview (continued) 

Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation Activities 
 On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the Company s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is provided. 
 
 Consent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile Lending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage Lending 
 On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer remediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain practices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive refunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile protection agreements; comply with certain business practice requirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a 1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related to many of these matters were already substantially complete at the time we entered into the consent order, and the consent order lays out a path to termination after the Company completes the remainder of the required actions. 
 
 Formal Agreement with the OCC Regarding Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Risk Management Practices 
 On September 12, 2024, the Company announced that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into a formal agreement with the OCC related to the bank s anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions risk management practices. The agreement s requirements include enhancements to AML and sanctions risk management practices, obtaining the OCC s acceptance of the bank s program for assessing the AML and sanctions risks of new offerings, and then providing notice to the OCC before expanding certain of those offerings. 
 
 Customer Remediation Activities 
 Our work to build a better company has included an effort to identify areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and implement additional operational and control procedures. We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. 
 We have accrued for the probable and estimable costs related to our customer remediation activities, which amounts may change based on additional facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. We had 241 million and 819 million of accrued liabilities for customer remediation activities as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the future identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any customer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. 

Recent Developments 
 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment 
 In November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) finalized a rule to recover losses to the FDIC deposit insurance fund as a result of bank failures in the first half of 2023. Under the rule, the FDIC will collect a special assessment based on an insured depository institution s estimated amount of uninsured deposits. Upon the FDIC s finalization of the rule, we expensed an estimated amount of our special assessment of 1.9 billion (pre-tax) in fourth quarter 2023. During 2024, the FDIC provided updates on losses to the deposit insurance fund, which resulted in a reversal of expense of 63 million (pre-tax) in third quarter 2024 and an additional expense of 273 million (pre-tax) in the first nine months of 2024 for the estimated amount of the special assessment. We expect the ultimate amount of the special assessment may continue to change as the FDIC determines the actual net losses to the deposit insurance fund. 
 
 Overdraft Fees Proposal 
 On January 17, 2024, the CFPB issued a proposed rule that would limit overdraft fees charged by certain banks. We expect a significant reduction to our overdraft fees, which are included in deposit-related fees, if the rule is adopted as currently proposed. 
 
 Debit Card Interchange Fees Proposal 
 On October 25, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would reduce the amount of debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers. In addition, the proposed rule would allow for an update to the debit card interchange fee cap every other year based on an analysis of certain costs incurred by debit card issuers. We expect a significant reduction to our debit card interchange fees, which are included in card fees, if the rule is adopted as currently proposed.

 noninterest expense decreased slightly due to lower professional and outside services expense, largely offset by higher technology, telecommunications and equipment expense; 
 average loans decreased driven by a decline in loans in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios; and 
 average deposits increased driven by growth in Corporate and Investment Banking and Commercial Banking, partially offset by reductions in Consumer Banking and Lending and Corporate. 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we generated 14.6 billion of net income and diluted EPS of 3.94, compared with 15.7 billion of net income and diluted EPS of 3.96 in the same period a year ago.

 total revenue decreased due to lower net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest income; 
 provision for credit losses reflected decreases for auto loans, commercial real estate loans, and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by increases for credit card loans; 
 noninterest expense increased due to higher operating losses, and technology, telecommunications and equipment expense, partially offset by lower professional and outside services expense; 
 average loans decreased driven by a decline in loans in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios; and 
 average deposits decreased driven by reductions in Consumer Banking and Lending and Wealth and Investment Management, partially offset by growth in Corporate and Investment Banking and Corporate. 

Capital and Liquidity 
 We maintained a strong capital position in the first nine months of 2024, with total equity of 185.0 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 187.4 billion at December 31, 2023. In addition, capital and liquidity at September 30, 2024, included the following: 
 our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 11.34 under the Standardized Approach (our binding ratio), which continued to exceed the regulatory minimum and buffers of 8.90 . As of October 1, 2024, our stress capital buffer increased to 3.80 , resulting in a CET1 regulatory minimum and buffers of 9.80 ; 
 our total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 25.29 , compared with the regulatory minimum of 21.50 ; and 
 our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 127 , which continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100 . 
 See the Capital Management and the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management Liquidity Risk and Funding sections in this Report for additional information regarding our capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory capital and liquidity amounts.

 Credit quality reflected the following: 
 The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 14.7 billion at September 30, 2024, decreased 349 million from December 31, 2023. 
 Our provision for credit losses for loans was 3.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 4.1 billion in the same period a year ago. The ACL for loans and the provision for credit losses for loans reflected decreases for auto loans, commercial real estate loans, and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by increases for credit card loans. 
 The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.62 at September 30, 2024, compared with 1.61 at December 31, 2023. 
 Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were 323 million, or 24 basis points of average commercial loans, in third quarter 2024, compared with net loan charge-offs of 188 million, or 13 basis points, in the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher losses in our commercial real estate portfolio driven by the office property type.

Overview (continued) 

Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were 788 million, or 83 basis points of average consumer loans, in third quarter 2024, compared with net loan charge-offs of 662 million, or 67 basis points, in the same period a year ago, due to higher losses in our credit card portfolio driven by higher loan balances, partially offset by lower losses in our auto portfolio. 
 Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of 8.4 billion at September 30, 2024, decreased 59 million, or 1 , from 

December 31, 2023, driven by a decrease in residential mortgage nonaccrual loans, partially offset by an increase in commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans. NPAs represented 0.92 of total loans at September 30, 2024. 
 Criticized loans in the commercial portfolio were 37.6 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 33.0 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by increases in criticized commercial and industrial loans. 

Earnings Performance 
 Wells Fargo net income for third quarter 2024 was 5.1 billion 1.42 diluted EPS), compared with 5.8 billion 1.48 diluted EPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income decreased in third quarter 2024, compared with the same period a year ago, predominantly due to a 1.4 billion decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a 924 million increase in noninterest income. 
 Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was 14.6 billion 3.94 diluted EPS), compared with 15.7 billion 3.96 diluted EPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income decreased in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same period a year ago, predominantly due to a 3.8 billion decrease in net interest income and a 922 million increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a 3.6 billion increase in noninterest income. 

Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities, including a deposit mix shift to interest-bearing deposits, as well as lower loan balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on interest-earning assets. 
 Table 1 presents the individual components of net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in Table 1 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt loans and debt and equity securities. The calculation for taxable-equivalent basis was based on a federal statutory tax rate of 21 .

 Operating Segment Results 
 Our management reporting is organized into four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. For additional information, see Table 5 below. We define our reportable operating segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior management. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to assess performance consistently across the operating segments. 
 
 Funds Transfer Pricing Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 
 
 Revenue and Expense Sharing When lines of business jointly serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 

business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. 
 When a line of business uses a service provided by another line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the service provided. We periodically assess and update our revenue and expense allocation methodologies. 
 
 Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for affordable housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company s consolidated financial results. 
 
 Allocated Capital Reportable operating segments are allocated capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed and updated. Management believes that return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess a reportable operating segment s use of capital. 
 
 Selected Metrics We present certain financial and nonfinancial metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable operating segment results. Management believes that these metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable operating segments or lines of business.

 a decline in loan balances in our Home Lending business reflecting lower loan demand due to the impact of the higher interest rate environment; and 
 a decline in loan balances in our Auto business as paydowns exceeded originations reflecting our actions related to credit tightening; 
 partially offset by: 
 an increase in loan balances in our Credit Card business due to higher point of sale volume driven by new account growth. 
 Total deposits (average and period-end) decreased driven by customer migration to higher yielding deposit products, including promotional savings and time deposit accounts.

 Revenue decreased slightly, reflecting: 
 lower net interest income driven by higher deposit costs and lower loan balances; 
 partially offset by: 
 higher net gains from trading activities reflecting higher trading activity across most fixed income asset classes, partially offset by lower revenue in equities ; and 
 higher investment banking fees due to higher debt underwriting fees driven by increased activity, partially offset by lower advisory fee income. 

Provision for credit losses reflected a decrease in the allowance for credit losses driven by commercial real estate loans.

 Total deposits (average) decreased driven by customer migration to higher yielding alternatives. 
 WIM Advisory Assets In addition to transactional accounts, WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage customers. Fees from advisory accounts are based on a percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the 

distinct services provided, and are affected by investment performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and separately managed by third-party managers as well as certain client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. 
 WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage of the market value of these assets. Table 6h presents advisory assets activity by WIM line of business. Management believes that advisory assets is a useful metric because it allows management, investors, and others to assess how changes in asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based fees. 
 For the third quarter of both 2024 and 2023, the average fee rate by account type ranged from 50 to 120 basis points.

 (2) Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
 (3) Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. 
 Table 7 presents a summary of our portfolio of investments in available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities. See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on AFS and HTM debt securities, including a summary of debt securities by security type, contractual maturities and weighted average yields. See also the Balance Sheet Analysis Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities section in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on our investment management objectives and practices and the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management section in this Report for information on liquidity and interest rate risk. 
 The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of the total AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio increased from December 31, 2023. Purchases of AFS debt securities were partially offset by paydowns and maturities of AFS and HTM debt securities, as well as sales of AFS debt securities . 

The total net unrealized losses on AFS and HTM debt securities decreased from December 31, 2023, due to changes in interest rates and the realization of losses related to a repositioning of our AFS debt securities portfolio . The repositioning included the sale of approximately 16 billion of AFS debt securities and reinvestment of the proceeds into AFS debt securities with higher yields. 
 At September 30, 2024, 99 of the combined AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are based on external ratings where available and, where not available, based on internal credit grades.

Balance Sheet Analysis (continued) 

Loan Portfolios 
 Table 8 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by portfolio segment. Commercial loans decreased from December 31, 2023, due to decreases in both the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios as paydowns exceeded originations and advances. Consumer loans 

decreased from December 31, 2023, driven by decreases in the residential mortgage and auto loan portfolios as paydowns exceeded originations, partially offset by an increase in credit card loans due to higher point of sale volume driven by new account growth.

 See the Balance Sheet Analysis Loan Portfolios section in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding contractual loan maturities and the distribution of loans to changes in interest rates. 

Deposits 
 Deposits decreased from December 31, 2023, reflecting: 
 lower time deposits driven by maturities of CDs issued by corporate treasury; 
 partially offset by: 
 growth in commercial deposits. 
 
 Table 9 provides additional information regarding deposit balances. Certain deposit balances, including noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposits, were impacted by efforts to align legacy products with current deposit product offerings. Information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income and a comparison of average deposit balances is provided in the Earnings Performance Net Interest Income section and Table 1 earlier in this Report. Our average deposit cost in third quarter 2024 increased to 1.91 , compared with 1.58 in fourth quarter 2023.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial transactions that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, or may be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include unfunded credit commitments, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. 
 
 Unfunded Credit Commitments 
 Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required collateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual amount because these commitments may expire without being used or may be cancelled at the customer s request. Our credit risk monitoring activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity structure of these commitments. For additional information, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 
 Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability companies or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with securitization transactions and are considered variable interest entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 13 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Commitments 
 Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar arrangements. We also enter into other commitments such as commitments to purchase securities under resale agreements. For additional information, see Note 14 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 
 Derivatives 
 We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The notional amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, see Note 11 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Wells Fargo Company 27 

Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders. 
 For additional information about how we manage risk, see the Risk Management section in our 2023 Form 10-K. The discussion that follows supplements our discussion of the management of certain risks contained in the Risk Management section in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Credit Risk Management 
 Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many of the Company s assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, certain derivatives, and loans. 
 The Board s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. At the management level, Corporate Credit Risk, which is part of Independent Risk Management, has oversight responsibility for credit risk. Corporate Credit Risk reports to the Chief Risk Officer and supports periodic reports related to credit risk provided to the Board s Risk Committee. 
 
 Loan Portfolio Our loan portfolios represent the largest component of assets on our consolidated balance sheet for which we have credit risk. Table 10 presents our total loans outstanding by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable.

 We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple risk factors affecting loans we hold including: 
 Loan concentrations and related credit quality; 
 Counterparty credit risk; 
 Economic and market conditions; 
 Legislative or regulatory mandates; 
 Changes in interest rates; 
 Merger and acquisition activities; and 
 Reputation risk. 

In addition, the Company will continue to integrate climate considerations into its credit risk management activities. 
 Our credit risk management oversight process is governed centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit process. 
 A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable early identification of developing risk and to support our determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The following discussion provides additional characteristics and analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for more analysis and credit metric information for each of the following portfolios. 
 
 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING 
 For purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease financing to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss categories. 

Generally, the primary source of repayment for our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio is the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of repayment. The majority of this portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory, and debt securities, as well as long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
 We had 17.9 billion of the commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in accordance with regulatory guidance at September 30, 2024, compared with 14.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by the entertainment and recreation; equipment, machinery, and parts manufacturing; auto related; agribusiness; and technology, telecom and media industries. 
 The portfolio decreased at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, as a result of paydowns and decreased loan draws. Table 12 provides our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing by industry. The industry categories are based on the North American Industry Classification System.

Table 12a provides further loan segmentation for our largest industry category, financials except banks. This category includes loans to investment firms, financial vehicles, nonbank creditors, rental and leasing companies, securities firms, and investment banks. These loans are generally secured and have features to help manage credit risk, such as structural credit enhancements, 

collateral eligibility requirements, contractual re-margining of collateral supporting the loans, and loan amounts limited to a percentage of the value of the underlying assets considering underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing performance.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE) Our CRE loan portfolio is composed of CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans. The total CRE loan portfolio decreased 9.2 billion from December 31, 2023, as paydowns exceeded originations and advances. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by property type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE loans are in California, New York, Florida, and Texas, which represented a combined 48 of the total CRE portfolio. The largest property type concentrations are apartments at 29 and office at 21 of the portfolio. Unfunded credit commitments at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were 5.8 billion and 7.7 billion, respectively, for CRE mortgage loans and 8.4 billion and 13.2 billion, respectively, for CRE construction loans. 
 We generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. We had 

18.6 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized at September 30, 2024, compared with 17.5 billion at December 31, 2023. We had 1.1 billion of CRE construction loans classified as criticized at September 30, 2024, compared with 830 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in criticized CRE loans was primarily driven by the apartments property type, partially offset by the institutional property type. 
 We continue to closely monitor the credit quality of the office property type given weakened demand for office space. Loans in California and New York represented approximately 40 of the office property type at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

Risk Management Credit Risk Management (continued) 

NON-U.S. LOANS Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on whether the borrower s primary address is outside of the United States. At September 30, 2024, non-U.S. loans totaled 70.1 billion, representing approximately 8 of our total consolidated loans outstanding, compared with 80.0 billion, or approximately 9 of our total consolidated loans outstanding, at December 31, 2023. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4 of our total consolidated assets at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 
 COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE Our country risk monitoring process incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure limits for each country through a centralized oversight process based on customer needs, and through consideration of the relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure based on our assessment of a borrower s ability to repay, 
 which gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the reporting based on a borrower s primary address. 
 Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at September 30, 2024, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 

31.2 billion, or approximately 2 of our total assets, of which 6.0 billion were sovereign exposures and included deposits we have placed with the Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support of our London branch. 
 Table 14 provides information regarding our top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to Table 14: 
 Lending and deposits with banks exposure includes outstanding loans, unfunded credit commitments (excluding discretionary amounts where our approval or consent is required prior to any loan funding or commitment increase), and deposits with non-U.S. banks. These balances are presented prior to the deduction of the allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the terms of the credit agreements, if any. 
 Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of non-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and net short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 
 Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, and securities lending agreements.

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS Our residential mortgage loan portfolio is composed of 1 4 family first and junior lien mortgage loans. Residential mortgage first lien loans represented 96 of the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes loans with adjustable-rate features. We monitor the risk of default as a result of interest rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans, which may be mitigated by product features that limit the amount of the increase in the contractual interest rate. The default risk of these loans is considered in our ACL for loans. ARM loans totaled 66.3 billion, or 7 of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared with 66.7 billion, or 7 of total loans, at December 31, 2023, with an initial reset date in 2026 or later for the majority of this portfolio at September 30, 2024. We do not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans. 
 The residential mortgage junior lien portfolio consists of residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar features. The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of credit was 13.1 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 15.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The unfunded credit commitments for these lines of credit totaled 24.2 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 28.6 billion at December 31, 2023. For additional information on our residential mortgage loan portfolio, see the Risk Management Credit Risk Management Residential Mortgage Loans section in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying economic or market conditions for the geographic areas of our 

residential mortgage loan portfolio as part of our credit risk management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property values. For additional information about our use of appraisals and AVMs, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report and the Risk Management Credit Risk Management Residential Mortgage Loans section in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, current Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan to collateral values (LTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. For junior lien mortgages, LTV uses the total combined loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages (including unused line of credit amounts). For additional information regarding credit quality indicators, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. For additional information on loan modifications, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report and the Risk Management Credit Risk Management Residential Mortgage Loans section in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 (2) Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in accounts receivable in other assets. For additional information on the classification of certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Total nonaccrual loans decreased 84 million from December 31, 2023, driven by a decrease in residential mortgage nonaccrual loans, partially offset by an increase in commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans. 
 For additional information on commercial nonaccrual loans, see the Risk Management Credit Risk Management Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease Financing and Risk Management Credit Risk Management Commercial Real Estate sections in this Report.

Table 19 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual loans. Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our policies, offset by reductions for loans 

that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and an improvement in the borrower s financial condition and loan repayment capabilities.

 We considered the risk of losses on nonaccrual loans in developing our allowance for loan losses. We believe exposure to losses on nonaccrual loans is mitigated by the following factors at September 30, 2024: 
 98 of total commercial nonaccrual loans were secured, predominantly by real estate. 
 62 of total commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest and 54 of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on both principal and interest, but were on nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of interest or principal had become uncertain. 

99 of total consumer nonaccrual loans were secured, of which 96 were secured by real estate and 98 had an LTV ratio of 80 or less. 
 453 million of the 575 million of consumer loans in bankruptcy or discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as nonaccrual, were current.

 (1) Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average loans are annualized. 
 The increase in commercial net loan charge-offs in third quarter 2024, compared with the same period a year ago, was primarily due to higher losses in our commercial real estate portfolio driven by the office property type. 
 The increase in consumer net loan charge-offs in third quarter 2024, compared with the same period a year ago, was due to higher losses in our credit card portfolio driven by higher loan balances, partially offset by lower losses in our auto portfolio. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES We maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management s estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, including deposits with banks, net investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

The process for establishing the ACL for loans takes into consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the allowance as we use several analytical tools. For additional information on our ACL, see the Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. For additional information on our ACL for loans, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for additional information on our ACL for debt securities, see Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

 (2) Total net loan charge-offs are annualized for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for loans presented in Table 22 may fluctuate from period to period due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of collateral. 
 The ACL for loans decreased 349 million, or 2 , from December 31, 2023, reflecting decreases for auto loans, commercial real estate loans, and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by increases for credit card loans. The detail of the changes in the ACL for loans by portfolio segment (including charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is included in Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our estimate of the ACL for loans, which generally include a base scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios. We weighted the base scenario and the downside scenarios in our estimate of the ACL for loans at September 30, 2024. The base scenario assumed slowing inflation with slowing economic growth and also reflected a significant decline in commercial real estate prices and increased unemployment rates from historically low levels. The downside scenarios assumed a more substantial economic contraction due to declining property values, high inflation, and lower business and consumer confidence. 
 Additionally, we consider qualitative factors that represent the risk of limitations inherent in our processes and assumptions such as economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. 

The forecasted key economic variables used in our estimate of the ACL for loans at September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, are presented in Table 23.

 Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic conditions and expectations (including for unemployment and real GDP), among other factors.

 Wells Fargo Company 

We believe the ACL for loans of 14.7 billion at September 30, 2024, was appropriate to cover expected credit losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects existing factors as of the date of determination, including economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes in the economic and business environment, it is possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES We sell residential and commercial mortgage loans to various parties. In connection with our sales and securitization of residential mortgage loans, we have established a mortgage repurchase liability. For information on our repurchase liability, see the Risk Management Credit Risk Management Mortgage Banking Activities section in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial mortgage loans included in government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. 
 As a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on mortgage loans we service. The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees. 

In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon transfer as servicer, we have the option to repurchase loans from certain loan securitizations, which generally becomes exercisable based on delinquency status such as when three scheduled loan payments are past due. When we have the unilateral option to repurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and a corresponding liability on our balance sheet regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan. We may repurchase these loans for cash and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. 
 Loans repurchased from GNMA securitization pools that regain current status or are otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization pools. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, these loans, which we have repurchased or have the unilateral option to repurchase, were 7.5 billion and 7.8 billion, respectively, which included 7.1 billion and 7.4 billion, respectively, in loans held for investment, with the remainder in loans held for sale. See Note 13 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our involvement with mortgage loan securitizations.

Asset/Liability Management 
 Asset/liability management involves measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. For additional information on our oversight of asset/liability risks, see the "Risk Management Asset/Liability Management" section in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that market fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange can cause a loss of the Company s earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the cash flows of the Company s assets and liabilities generally arising from customer-related lending and deposit-taking activities. We are subject to interest rate risk because: 
 assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times or by different amounts; 
 short-term and long-term market interest rates may change independently or with different magnitudes; 
 the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change; or 
 interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, loan origination volume, and the fair value of financial instruments and MSRs. 
 We assess interest rate risk by comparing the earnings outcomes from multiple interest rate scenarios relative to our base scenario. The base scenario is a reference point used by the Company for financial planning purposes. These scenarios may differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the degree and speed of interest rate changes over time, and the projected shape of the yield curve. They also require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. We periodically assess and enhance our scenarios and assumptions. 
 Table 24 presents the results of the estimated net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months from the multiple scenarios compared with our base scenario. These hypothetical scenarios include instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher interest rates under a parallel shift, as well as steeper and flatter non-parallel changes in the yield curve. Long-term interest rates are defined as all tenors three years and longer, and short-term interest rates are defined as all tenors less than three years. Our scenario assumptions reflected the following: 
 Scenarios are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our assets and liabilities over time. 
 Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates. 
 Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 
 The funding forecast in our base scenario incorporates deposit mix changes and market funding levels consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Our hypothetical scenarios incorporate deposit mix that is the same as in the base scenario. In higher interest rate scenarios, potential customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding products and/or requires additional market funding could reduce the expected benefit from higher rates. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, a potential shift to a funding mix with lower yielding deposits and/or less market funding could reduce the impact of lower rates on earning assets in these scenarios. 

The interest rate sensitivity of deposits as market interest rates change, referred to as deposit betas, are informed by historical behavior and expectations for near-term pricing strategies. Our actual experience may differ from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors. 
 Table 24: Net Interest Income Sensitivity Over the Next 12 Months Using Instantaneous Movements 
 in billions) 
 Sep 30, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Parallel shift: +100 bps shift in interest rates 0.9 1.8 -100 bps shift in interest rates (1.5) (2.0) -200 bps shift in interest rates (3.1) (4.3) Steeper yield curve: +100 bps shift in long-term interest rates 1.1 1.1 -100 bps shift in short-term interest rates (0.4) (1.0) Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term interest rates (0.2) 0.7 -100 bps shift in long-term interest rates (1.1) (1.1) 
 The changes in our interest rate sensitivity from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, reflected updates for our expected balance sheet composition. Our interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income. The realized impact of interest rate changes may vary from our base and hypothetical scenarios for various reasons, including any deposit pricing lags. 
 We use interest rate derivatives and our debt securities portfolio to manage our interest rate exposures. We use derivatives for asset/liability management to (i) convert cash flows from selected assets and/or liabilities from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice versa, (ii) reduce accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) sensitivity of our AFS debt securities portfolio, and/or (iii) economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures are presented in Note 11 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes unrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt securities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently amortized into earnings over the life of the security with no further impact from interest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on our debt securities portfolio. 
 In addition to the net interest income sensitivity above, we also measure and evaluate the economic value sensitivity (EVS) of our balance sheet. EVS is the change in the present value of the life-time cash flows of the Company s assets and liabilities across a range of scenarios. It is based on the existing balance sheet, at a point in time, and helps indicate whether we are exposed to higher or lower interest rates. We manage EVS through a set of limits that are designed to align with our interest rate risk appetite. 
 Our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense are impacted by mortgage banking activities that may have 

40 
 Wells Fargo Company 

sensitivity impacts that move in the opposite direction of our net interest income. See the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk section in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Interest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted by changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees on commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the impact to net interest income does not include the fair value changes of trading securities, which, along with the effects of related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In addition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and noninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by the actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 
 MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK We originate and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to various risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability management activities. We may also retain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. 
 Changes in interest rates may impact mortgage banking noninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate locks extended to mortgage applicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer demand, as well as the time required for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest rates. For additional information on mortgage banking, including key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk section and Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 14 (Derivatives), and Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the trading book, mortgage servicing rights, the hedge effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book held at fair value, and impairment on private equity investments. For additional information on our oversight of market risk, see the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management Market Risk section in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 MARKET RISK TRADING ACTIVITIES We engage in trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities predominantly occur within our CIB businesses. Debt and equity securities held for trading, trading loans, and trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading activities, and are measured at fair value through earnings. Income earned on the financial instruments used in our trading activities include net interest income, changes in fair value, and realized gains and losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is reflected in the interest income and interest expense components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes in fair value and realized gains and losses of the financial instruments used in our trading activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For additional information on the financial instruments used in our trading activities and the income from these trading activities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial markets, and Trading VaR is a measure used to provide insight into the market risk exhibited by the Company s trading positions on our consolidated balance sheet. The Company uses these VaR metrics complemented with sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and monitoring market risk. Table 25 shows the Company s Trading General VaR by risk category. For additional information on our monitoring activities, sensitivity analysis, stress testing, Trading VaR, and Trading General VaR, see the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management Market Risk Trading Activities section in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 (1) The period-end and average VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on different days.

 MARKET RISK EQUITY SECURITIES We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage equity investments in various businesses, such as start-up companies and emerging growth companies. We also invest in funds that make similar private equity investments. For additional information, see the Risk Management Asset/Liability Management Market Risk Equity Securities section in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 As part of our business to support our customers, we trade public equities, listed/over-the-counter equity derivatives, and convertible bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also have equity securities that include investments relating to our venture capital activities. For additional information, see Note 4 (Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and other business activities. Each business line monitors and manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING Liquidity risk is the risk arising from the inability of the Company to meet obligations when they come due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without incurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, including funding for customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, leases for premises and equipment, and other cash commitments. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of deposits, including the risk of losing uninsured or non-operational deposits. The objective of effective liquidity management is to be able to meet our contractual obligations and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or market stress. 
 To help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are 

monitored on a monthly basis by the management-level Corporate Asset/Liability Committee and on a quarterly basis by the Board. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the Company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis so that the Parent is a source of strength for its banking subsidiaries. For additional information on liquidity risk and funding management, see the Risk Management Liquidity Risk and Funding section in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Liquidity Standards We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity requirement, known as the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day stress period. Our HQLA under the rule mainly consists of central bank deposits, government debt securities, and mortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies to the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) with total assets of 10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as Wells Fargo. 
 We are also subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and FDIC that establishes a stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, including common equity, long-term debt and most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon period. The NSFR applies to the Company and to our IDIs with total assets of 10 billion or more. As of September 30, 2024, we were compliant with the NSFR requirement. 
 
 Liquidity Coverage Ratio As of September 30, 2024, the Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo National Bank West exceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 100 . The LCR represents average HQLA divided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. 
 Table 26 presents the Company s quarterly average values for the daily-calculated LCR and its components calculated pursuant to the LCR rule requirements. 

Table 26: Liquidity Coverage Ratio

 (1) Excludes excess HQLA at certain subsidiaries that are not transferable to other Wells Fargo entities. 
 (2) Net of applicable haircuts required under the LCR rule. 
 (3) Projected net cash outflows are calculated by applying a standardized set of outflow and inflow assumptions, defined by the LCR rule, to various exposures and liability types, such as deposits and unfunded loan commitments, which are prescribed based on a number of factors, including the type of customer and the nature of the account. 
 Liquidity Sources We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, interest-earning deposits with banks, and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are substantially the same in composition as HQLA under the LCR rule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable 

haircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our subsidiary IDIs required under the LCR rule. Our primary sources of liquidity are presented in Table 27 at fair value, which also includes encumbered securities that are not included as available HQLA in the calculation of the LCR.

 (2) Excludes time deposits, which are included in interest-earning deposits with banks in our consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 Our interest-earning deposits with banks are mainly on deposit with the Federal Reserve. We believe the debt securities included in Table 27 provide quick and reliable sources of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions. Debt securities within our HTM portfolio are not intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 593.7 billion of available borrowing capacity at various Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window, based on collateral pledged. Although available, we do not view this borrowing capacity as a primary source of liquidity. 
 In addition, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of other debt securities, including trading and/or AFS debt securities, as well as through the sale, securitization, or financing of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are not encumbered. 
 
 Funding Sources The Parent acts as a source of funding for the Company through the issuance of long-term debt and equity. WFC Holdings, LLC (the IHC is an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent, which provides funding support for the ongoing operational requirements of the Parent 

and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For additional information on the IHC, see the Regulatory Matters Living Will Requirements and Related Matters section in our 2023 Form 10-K. Additional subsidiary funding is provided by deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. 
 Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of relatively low-cost funds. Loans were 67 and 69 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Table 28 presents a summary of our short-term borrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days. The balances of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase may vary over time due to client activity, our own demand for financing, and our overall mix of liabilities. For additional information on the classification of our short-term borrowings, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. We pledge certain financial instruments that we own to collateralize repurchase agreements and other securities financings, as well as borrowings from the FHLB. For additional information, see the Pledged Assets section of Note 16 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements in this Report.

 We access domestic and international capital markets for long-term funding through issuances of registered debt securities, private placements, securitizations, and asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for general corporate purposes unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, and we expect the proceeds from securities issued 

in the future will be used for the same purposes. Depending on market conditions and our liquidity position, we may redeem or 
 repurchase, and subsequently retire, our outstanding debt securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer, or otherwise. Table 29 provides the aggregate carrying value of long-term debt maturities (based on contractual payment dates) for the remainder of 2024 and the following years thereafter, as of September 30, 2024.

 Credit Ratings Investors in the long-term capital markets, as well as other market participants, generally will consider, among other factors, a company s debt rating in making investment decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 
 There were no actions undertaken by the rating agencies with regard to our credit ratings during third quarter 2024. 

See the Risk Factors section in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our credit ratings and the potential impact a credit rating downgrade would have on our liquidity and operations as well as Note 11 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade. 
 The credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as of September 30, 2024, are presented in Table 30.

Capital Management 
 We have an active program for managing capital through a comprehensive process for assessing the Company s overall capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the retention of earnings net of both dividends and share repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock and long- and short-term debt. For additional information about capital planning, see the Capital Planning and Stress Testing section below. 
 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 
 
 RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. 
 In July 2023, federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule to implement the final components of Basel III, which would impact risk-based capital requirements for certain banks. The proposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach and replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the measurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular risk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a new standardized approach for measuring operational risk. Officials from federal banking regulators have since commented that there may be significant changes to the proposed rule. 
 Table 31 and Table 32 present the risk-based capital requirements applicable to the Company under the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. 
 Table 31: Risk-Based Capital Requirements Standardized Approach 

Table 32: Risk-Based Capital Requirements Advanced Approach 
 
 In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described in Table 31 and Table 32, if the FRB determines that a period of excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50 could be added to the risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking regulations. The countercyclical buffer in effect at September 30, 2024, was 0.00 . 
 The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or financial stress. 
 The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease in a BHC s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the FRB s annual supervisory stress test and related Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for the period October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024, was 2.90 . Our stress capital buffer for the period October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025, is 3.80 . 

Wells Fargo Company 45 

Capital Management (continued) 

 As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also subject to the FRB s rule implementing an additional capital surcharge between 1.00-4.50 on the risk-based capital ratio requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If our annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital surcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our annual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital 

surcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our G-SIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50 in 2024. On July 27, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would impact the methodology used to calculate the G-SIB capital surcharge. 
 Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets (RWAs). 
 The tables that follow provide information about our risk-based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III capital rules. Table 33 summarizes our CET1, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, RWAs and capital ratios.

In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision issued by federal banking regulators related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25 of the cumulative changes in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) under CECL for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the benefit is reduced by 25 in year one, 50 in year two and 75 in year three. 
 (3) Differences between the approaches are driven by the qualifying amounts of ACL includable in Tier 2 capital. Under the Advanced Approach, eligible credit reserves represented by the amount of qualifying ACL in excess of expected credit losses (using regulatory definitions) is limited to 0.60 of Advanced credit RWAs, whereas the Standardized Approach includes ACL in Tier 2 capital up to 1.25 of Standardized credit RWAs. Under both approaches, any excess ACL is deducted from the respective total RWAs.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The ratios are (i) tangible book value per common share, which represents tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding; and (ii) return on average tangible common 

equity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized earnings as a percentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that tangible book value per common share and return on average tangible common equity, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable management, investors, and others to assess the Company s use of equity. 
 Table 37 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

 LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS As a BHC, we are required to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio. Table 38 presents the leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of September 30, 2024. 
 Table 38: Leverage Requirements Applicable to the Company 

Wells Fargo Company 49 

Capital Management (continued) 

 In addition, our IDIs are required to maintain an SLR of at least 6.00 to be considered well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy rules and maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00 . 
 Table 39 presents information regarding the calculation and components of the Company s SLR and Tier 1 leverage ratio. At September 30, 2024, each of our IDIs exceeded their applicable SLR requirements.

 (2) Adjustment represents counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions where Wells Fargo Company is the principal counterparty facing the client. 
 (3) Adjustment represents credit equivalent amounts of other off-balance sheet exposures not already included as derivatives and repo-style transactions exposures. 
 TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY As a G-SIB, we are required to have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt. The components used to calculate our minimum TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of September 30, 2024, are presented in Table 40. 
 Table 40: Components Used to Calculate TLAC and Eligible Unsecured Long-Term Debt Requirements 
 TLAC requirement 
 
 Greater of: 
 18.00 of RWAs 7.50 of total leverage exposure (the denominator of the SLR calculation) + + TLAC buffer (equal to 2.50 of RWAs + method one G-SIB capital surcharge + any countercyclical buffer) External TLAC leverage buffer (equal to 2.00 of total leverage exposure) Minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt 
 
 Greater of: 
 6.00 of RWAs 4.50 of total leverage exposure + Greater of method one and method two G-SIB capital surcharge 

In August 2023, the FRB proposed rules that would, among other things, modify the calculation of eligible long-term debt that counts towards the TLAC requirements, which would reduce our TLAC ratios.

 (3) Our minimum TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements are calculated based on the greater of RWAs determined under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. 
 OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS For information regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III LCR and NSFR, see the Risk Management Asset/ Liability Management Liquidity Risk and Funding Liquidity Standards section in this Report. 
 Our principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, are subject to regulations to maintain minimum net capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, these broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 
 Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
 Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow our business, satisfy our customers financial needs in varying environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital requirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the stress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, changes in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our long-term target capital levels are set above their respective regulatory minimums plus buffers. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we issued 929 million of common stock, substantially all of which was issued in connection with employee compensation and benefits, and we repurchased 275 million shares of common stock at a cost of 15.6 billion. We paid 4.6 billion of common and preferred stock dividends during the first nine months of 2024. 
 The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs when evaluating their capital plans. 
 As part of the annual CCAR, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test. The FRB reviews the supervisory stress test results as required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of 

50 
 Wells Fargo Company 

capital actions for all large BHCs and also reviews the Company s proposed capital actions. 
 Federal banking regulators also require large BHCs and banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions. 
 Securities Repurchases 
 On July 25, 2023, we announced that our Board authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to 30 billion. Unless modified or revoked by the Board, this authorization does not expire and is our only common stock repurchase program in effect. At September 30, 2024, we had remaining Board authority to repurchase up to approximately 11.3 billion of common stock. 
 Various factors impact the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of the Company, the impact to our balance sheet of expected customer activity, our capital requirements 

and long-term targeted capital structure, the results of supervisory stress tests, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including regulatory requirements under the FRB s capital plan rule. Although we announce when the Board authorizes a share repurchase program, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Due to the various factors that may impact the amount and timing of our share repurchases and the fact that we may be in the market throughout the year, our share repurchases occur at various prices. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any time. 
 Furthermore, the Company has a variety of benefit plans in which employees may own or obtain shares of our common stock. The Company may buy shares from these plans to accommodate employee preferences and these purchases are subtracted from our repurchase authority. 
 For additional information about share repurchases during third quarter 2024, see Part II, Item 2 in this Report. 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services companies conduct business and may continue to result in increased regulatory compliance costs. 
 For a discussion of certain consent orders and other regulatory actions applicable to the Company, see the Overview section in this Report. The following supplements our discussion of other significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our business contained in the Regulatory Matters and Risk Factors sections in our 2023 Form 10-K and the Regulatory Matters section in our 2024 First and Second Quarter Reports on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Personal Financial Data Rights 
 In October 2024, the CFPB issued a rule pursuant to section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act that requires financial service providers to make consumers data available upon request to consumers and authorized third parties. The compliance date for the rule is April 1, 2026. The rule will require the Company to update its technology systems, compliance, third-party risk management programs, and digital channels.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
 the allowance for credit losses; 
 the valuation of residential MSRs; 

the fair value of financial instruments; 
 income taxes; 
 liability for legal actions; and 
 goodwill impairment. 
 
 Management has discussed these critical accounting policies and the related estimates and judgments with the Board s Audit Committee. For additional information, see the Critical Accounting Policies section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Current Accounting Developments 
 Table 42 provides the significant accounting updates applicable to us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) but are not yet effective. 

Table 42: Current Accounting Developments Issued Standards Description and Effective Date Financial statement impact ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
 The Update, effective December 31, 2024 (with early adoption permitted), enhances reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures related to significant segment expenses and additional interim disclosure requirements. 
 The Update impacts disclosure only, and therefore does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact of the Update to our operating segment disclosures. The following aspects of the Update may result in disclosure changes: 
 
 Requirement to disclose significant segment expenses by reportable segment if they are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. 
 Requirement to disclose an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and provide a description of its composition; other segment items is measured as the difference between reported segment revenues less the significant segment expenses disclosed in accordance with the principle described above and reported segment profit or loss. 
 Requirement to disclose the CODM s title and position and explain how the CODM uses the reported segment profit or loss measure in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. 
 ASU 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
 The Update, effective January 1, 2025 (with early adoption permitted), enhances annual income tax disclosures primarily to further disaggregate existing disclosures related to the effective income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. 
 The impact of the Update is limited to our annual income tax disclosures. We are currently evaluating the impact of the Update to our income tax disclosures. Upon adoption, those disclosures may change as follows: 
 
 For the tabular effective income tax rate reconciliation, alignment to specific categories (where applicable) and further disaggregation of certain categories (where applicable) by nature and/or jurisdiction if the reconciling item is 5 or more of the statutory tax expense. 
 Description of states and local jurisdictions that contribute the majority of the effect of the state and local income tax category of the effective income tax rate reconciliation. 
 Disaggregate the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds) by federal, state, and non-U.S. taxes and further disaggregate by individual jurisdictions where income taxes paid (net of refunds) is 5 or more of total income taxes paid (net of refunds). 
 Disaggregate net income (or loss) before income tax expense (or benefit) between domestic and non-U.S.

Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in our other documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and our management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates, intends, plans, seeks, believes, estimates, expects, target, projects, outlook, forecast, will, may, could, should, can and similar references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the Company or any of its businesses, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our expectations regarding noninterest expense and our efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality and performance, including our expectations regarding future loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our expectations regarding net interest income and net interest margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or targets; (vii) the expected outcome and impact of legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our expectations regarding compliance therewith; (viii) future common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of capital; (ix) our targeted range for return on assets, return on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (x) expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xi) the outcome of contingencies, such as legal actions; (xii) environmental, social and governance related goals or commitments; and (xiii) the Company s plans, objectives and strategies. 
 Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: 
 current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of declines in housing prices, high unemployment rates, declines in commercial real estate prices, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global economic growth; 
 our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; 
 current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including rules and regulations relating to bank products and financial services; 
 our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 

result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory matters; 
 the effect of the current interest rate environment or changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our assets or liabilities on our net interest income and net interest margin; 
 significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets, which could result in, among other things, a reduction in the availability of funding or increased funding costs, a reduction in our ability to sell or securitize loans, and declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairment of securities held in our debt securities and equity securities portfolios; 
 the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment banking business and our fee income from our brokerage and wealth management businesses; 
 negative effects from instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including on our legal, operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our reputation; 
 regulatory matters, including the failure to resolve outstanding matters on a timely basis and the potential impact of new matters, litigation, or other legal actions, which may result in, among other things, additional costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
 a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks;

 Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures . From time to time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future results.

Risk Factors 
 
 An investment in the Company involves risk, including the possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could be reduced or eliminated. For a discussion of risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the Company, we refer you to the Risk Factors section in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management evaluated the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2024, of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during third quarter 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Credit Quality 
 We monitor credit quality of debt securities by evaluating various attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for debt securities. The credit quality indicators that we most closely monitor include credit ratings and delinquency status and are based on information as of our financial statement date. 
 
 CREDIT RATINGS Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a debt security. We determine the credit rating of a security according to the lowest credit rating made available by national recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities rated below investment grade, labeled as speculative grade by the rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher credit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt securities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management 

purposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major credit agencies. Substantially all of our debt securities were rated by NRSROs at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 (3) were rated AA- and above at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 (4) Includes non-U.S. government, non-agency mortgage-backed, and all other debt securities. 
 DELINQUENCY STATUS AND NONACCRUAL DEBT SECURITIES Debt security issuers that are delinquent in payment of amounts due under contractual debt agreements have a higher probability of recognition of credit losses. As such, as part of our monitoring of the credit quality of the debt security portfolio, we consider whether debt securities we own are past due in payment of principal or interest payments and whether any securities have been placed into nonaccrual status. 
 Debt securities that are past due and still accruing or in nonaccrual status were insignificant at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs on debt securities were insignificant in the third quarter and first nine months of both 2024 and 2023.

 (1) Gross unrealized losses exclude portfolio level basis adjustments. 
 We have assessed each debt security with gross unrealized losses included in the previous table for credit impairment. As part of that assessment we evaluated and concluded that we do not intend to sell any of the debt securities, and that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell, prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. We evaluate, where necessary, whether credit impairment exists by comparing the present value of the expected cash flows to the debt securities amortized cost basis. Credit impairment is recorded as an ACL for debt securities. 
 For descriptions of the factors we consider when analyzing debt securities for impairment as well as methodology and significant inputs used to measure credit losses, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS We have various classes of consumer loans that present unique credit risks. Loan delinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-to-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the primary credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer loan portfolio segment. 
 Many of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for loans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency is an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of our ACL for consumer loans. 
 We obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores are generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited circumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain loan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due to strong collateral and other borrower attributes. 
 LTV is the ratio of the outstanding loan balance divided by the property collateral value. For junior lien mortgages, we use the total combined loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages (including unused line of credit amounts). We obtain LTVs using a cascade approach which first uses values provided by automated valuation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not available, then the value is estimated using the original appraised value adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised value is used. The HPI value is normally the only method considered for high value properties, generally with an original value of million or more, as the AVM values have proven less accurate for these properties. Generally, we update LTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an LTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios acquired from or serviced by other institutions. 

Gross charge-offs by loan class are included in the following tables for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and year ended December 31, 2023, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management practices; however, charge-offs are not a primary credit quality indicator for our loan portfolio. 
 Credit quality information is provided with the year of origination for term loans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual provision in the original loan agreement or if modified for a borrower experiencing financial difficulty.

Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau guidelines, we do not commence the foreclosure process on residential mortgage loans until after the loan is 120 days delinquent. Foreclosure procedures and timelines vary depending on whether the property address resides in a judicial or non-judicial state. Judicial states require the foreclosure to be processed through the state s courts while non-judicial states are processed without court intervention. Foreclosure timelines vary according to state law.

billion in order to settle the consolidated action. Several merchants opted out of the settlement and are pursuing individual actions. In June 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the settlement agreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action to the district court for further proceedings. In November 2016, the district court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. The parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the damages class claims pursuant to which defendants agreed to pay a total of approximately billion, which includes approximately billion of funds remaining in escrow from the 2012 settlement and million in additional funding. Wells Fargo s allocated responsibility for the additional funding is approximately million. The court granted final approval of the settlement on December 13, 2019, which was affirmed by the Second Circuit on March 15, 2023. On September 27, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for class certification in the equitable relief case. On March 26, 2024, Visa and Mastercard entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the equitable relief class claims, which was denied by the district court on June 25, 2024. Some of the opt-out and direct-action cases have been settled while others remain pending.

billion as of September 30, 2024. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo s consolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo s results of operations for any particular period.

 We execute substantially all of our derivative transactions under master netting arrangements. Where legally enforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, in the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. We reflect all derivative balances and related cash collateral subject to enforceable master netting arrangements on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not net non-cash collateral that we receive or pledge against derivative balances on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 For disclosure purposes, we present Total Derivatives, net which represents the aggregate of our net exposure to each counterparty after considering the balance sheet netting

 Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges 
 For fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert certain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates of deposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. We also enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap contracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical commodities included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against changes in fair value of certain investments in AFS debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, or both. For certain fair value hedges of interest rate risk, we use the portfolio layer method to hedge stated amounts of closed portfolios of AFS debt securities. For certain fair value hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other 

comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 21 (Other Comprehensive Income) for the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest payments received on certain interest-earning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial loans. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge variability in interest payments on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated long-term debt due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 We estimate million pre-tax of deferred net losses related to cash flow hedges in OCI at September 30, 2024, will be reclassified into net interest income during the next twelve months. For cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2024, we are hedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for a maximum of approximately years.

 Substantially all residential servicing activity is related to assets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, advances and servicing fees. 
 
 NONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the normal course of business, we sell nonconforming mortgage loans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred loans and account for the transfers as sales. We also typically retain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIE, such as debt securities held for investment purposes. Our servicing role related to nonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is limited to primary or master servicer. We do not consolidate the VIE because the most significant decisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer or the controlling class security holder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider potentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets. 
 
 WHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We may also sell whole loans to VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of financing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs.

 In the normal course of business, we purchase certain 
 non-agency securities at initial securitization or subsequently in the secondary market, which we hold for investment. We also provide seller financing in the form of loans. We received cash flows of million and million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and million and million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, related to principal and interest payments on these securities and loans, which exclude cash flows related to trading activities.

RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES We enter into resecuritization transactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers. In resecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities to VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to third parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This activity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or risk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the resecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not consolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we share in the decision-making power with third parties and do not hold significant economic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we transferred trading debt securities of billion and billion, respectively, to resecuritization VIEs, and retained trading debt securities of million and million, respectively. These amounts are not included in Table 13.1. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we held million and million of trading debt securities, respectively. Total resecuritization VIE assets, to which we sold assets and hold an interest, were billion and billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total resecuritization VIE assets were billion and billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Transactions with Unconsolidated VIEs 
 MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS Table 13.4 includes nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations where we originate and transfer the loans to the unconsolidated securitization VIEs that we sponsor. For additional information about these VIEs, see the Loan Sales and Securitization Activity section within this Note. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations also include commercial mortgage loan securitizations sponsored by third parties where we did not originate or transfer the loans but serve as master servicer and invest in securities that could be potentially significant to the VIE. 
 Conforming loan securitization and resecuritization transactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are excluded from Table 13.4 because we are not the sponsor or we do not have power over the activities most significant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to the nature of the guarantees provided by the GSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk associated with these VIEs is limited. For additional information about conforming mortgage loan securitizations and resecuritizations, see the Loan Sales and Securitization Activity and Resecuritization Activities sections within this Note. 
 
 COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS We may transfer purchased industrial development bonds and GSE credit enhancements to VIEs in exchange for beneficial interests. We may also acquire such beneficial interests in transactions where we do not act as a transferor. We own all of the beneficial interests and may also service the underlying mortgages that serve as collateral to the bonds. The GSEs have the power to direct the servicing and workout activities of the VIE in the event of a default, therefore we do not have control over the key decisions of the VIEs. 

OTHER VIE STRUCTURES We engage in various forms of structured finance arrangements with other VIEs, including asset-backed finance structures and other securitizations collateralized by asset classes other than mortgages. Collateral may include rental properties, asset-backed securities, student loans and mortgage loans. We may participate in structuring or marketing the arrangements as well as provide financing, service one or more of the underlying assets, or enter into derivatives with the VIEs. We may also receive fees for those services. We are not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we do not have power to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs.

are required to provide additional financial support during the investment period, at the discretion of project sponsors, or for certain renewable energy investments, on a contingent basis based on the amount of income tax credits earned. For equity investments accounted for using the proportional amortization method, a liability is recognized for unfunded commitments that are either legally binding or contingent but probable of funding. The liability recognized for these commitments at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was billion and billion, respectively. Substantially all of these commitments are expected to be funded within .

 Maximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss that would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical circumstance, despite what we believe is a remote possibility, where the value of our interests and any associated collateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in 
 Table 14.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could use to offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee agreements. Accordingly, these amounts are not an indication of expected loss. We believe the carrying value is more representative of our current exposure to loss than maximum exposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of the guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if applicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider the credit risk of the related contingent obligation. 
 For our guarantees in Table 14.1, non-investment grade represents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of performance under the terms of the guarantee, which is determined based on an external rating or an internal credit grade that is below investment grade, if applicable. 
 
 WRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written foreign currency options and over-the-counter written equity put options that are derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. The fair value of written options represents our view of the probability that we will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value of these written options was an asset of million and million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value may be an asset as a result of deferred premiums on certain option trades. The maximum exposure to loss represents the notional value of these derivative contracts. At September 30, 2024, the maximum exposure to loss was billion, with billion expiring in three years or less compared with billion and billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023. See Note 11 (Derivatives) for additional information regarding written derivative contracts. 

MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit card transaction processing services through payment networks directly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing servicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in connection with payment and delivery disputes between the merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the cardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. We estimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total merchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four months, which is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back transaction. As of September 30, 2024, our potential maximum exposure was approximately billion, and related losses, including those from our joint venture entity, were insignificant. 
 
 GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES These securities are not guaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were billion and million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. These guarantees rank on parity with all of the Parent s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. 
 
 OTHER COMMITMENTS As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had commitments to purchase equity securities of billion and billion, respectively, which predominantly included Federal Reserve Bank stock and tax credit investments accounted for using the equity method.

reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. We define our reportable operating segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior management. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to assess performance consistently across the operating segments. 
 
 Consumer Banking and Lending offers diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses with annual sales generally up to million. These financial products and services include checking and savings accounts, credit and debit cards as well as home, auto, personal, and small business lending. 
 
 Commercial Banking provides financial solutions to private, family owned and certain public companies. Products and services include banking and credit products across multiple industry sectors and municipalities, secured lending and lease products, and treasury management. 
 
 Corporate and Investment Banking delivers a suite of capital markets, banking, and financial products and services to corporate, commercial real estate, government and institutional clients globally. Products and services include corporate banking, investment banking, treasury management, commercial real estate lending and servicing, equity and fixed income solutions as well as sales, trading, and research capabilities. 
 
 Wealth and Investment Management provides personalized wealth management, brokerage, financial planning, lending, private banking, trust and fiduciary products and services to affluent, high-net worth and ultra-high-net worth clients. We operate through financial advisors in our brokerage and wealth offices, consumer bank branches, independent offices, and digitally through WellsTrade and Intuitive Investor . 

Corporate includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, net of allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, liquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable operating segments, as well as our investment portfolio and venture capital and private equity investments. Corporate also includes certain lines of business that management has determined are no longer consistent with the long-term strategic goals of the Company as well as results for previously divested businesses. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 
 
 REVENUE AND EXPENSE SHARING When lines of business jointly serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. 
 When a line of business uses a service provided by another line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the service provided. We periodically assess and update our revenue and expense allocation methodologies. 
 
 TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for affordable housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company s consolidated financial results.

 Operating losses may have significant variability given the inherent and unpredictable nature of legal actions and customer remediation activities. The timing and determination of the amount of any associated losses for these matters depends on a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. 

million and billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with million and million in the same periods a year ago, and predominantly consisted of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit assessment expense. 
 In November 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule to recover losses to the FDIC deposit insurance fund as a result of bank failures in the first half of 2023. Under the rule, the FDIC will collect a special assessment based on an insured depository institution s estimated amount of uninsured deposits. Upon the FDIC s finalization of the rule, we expensed an estimated amount of our special assessment of billion (pre-tax) in fourth quarter 2023. During 2024, the FDIC provided updates on losses to the deposit insurance fund, which resulted in a reversal of expense of million (pre-tax) in the third quarter of 2024 and an additional expense of million (pre-tax) in the first nine months of 2024 for the estimated amount of the special assessment. We expect the ultimate amount of the special assessment may continue to change as the FDIC determines the actual net losses to the deposit insurance fund.

 Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act 
 Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to the Government of Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure may be required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. 
 
 In third quarter 2024, the Company blocked and reported to the U.S. Department of the Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) consumer bank accounts held by certain customers who the Company determined met the OFAC definition of the Government of Iran because of their employment at entities owned by the Government of Iran. During the quarter, before the accounts were closed and the funds were moved to a blocked account, there was some regular consumer activity in the accounts, including customer payments, the payment of accrued interest, and account maintenance activities. The Company s gross revenue attributable to these accounts while they were open was de minimis. The Company does not intend to engage in further activity with these accounts.
