All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this report, including statements regarding guidance, our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy and plans, user growth and engagement, product initiatives, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as anticipate, believe, contemplate, continue, could, estimate, expect, going to, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, target, will, or would or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions. We caution you that the foregoing may not include all of the forward-looking statements made in this report. 
 
 You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including among other things: 
 Our ability to attract and retain end-users, and do so in a cost-effective manner; 
 Our ability to manage our growth effectively; 
 Our ability to achieve profitability given our history of losses; 
 Our reliance on our third-party developer partners to continue to offer a competitive experience in existing and new games on our platform; 
 Risks related to the fact that a limited number of games account for a substantial portion of our revenue; 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Our reliance on third-party service providers including cloud computing services, payment processors, and infrastructure service providers, and our ability to manage our relationships with such providers or lose access to such services; 
 Our ability to maintain our brand and reputation; 
 The competitiveness of the broader entertainment industry, and the potential that our existing and potential users may be attracted to competing forms of entertainment; 
 Risk related to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, which our business is subject to and which are subject to change and could adversely affect our business; 
 Our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights; 
 Risks related to economic downturns, political uncertainty (including the results of the 2024 election cycle), and market conditions beyond our control;

 Our ability to timely and effectively remediate the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future; and 
 Our ability to mitigate the commercial, reputational and regulatory risks to our business that may arise as a consequence of our need to restate our financial statements. 
 
 These statements are based on our historical performance and on our current plans, estimates and projections in light of information currently available to us, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them. The inclusion of this forward-looking information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by us will be achieved. Forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and we undertake no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events, except as required by law.. 
 
 You should carefully consider the above factors, as well as the factors discussed in other risks described in Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The factors identified above should not be construed as an exhaustive list of factors that could affect our future results and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Furthermore, new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. If any of these trends, risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, revenue and financial results could be harmed, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.

On April 13, 2024, Skillz, Big Run, and AviaGames entered into a settlement agreement with respect to both the Patent Case and Unfair Competition Case pending against AviaGames (the Litigation Settlement ). In exchange for dismissal of both actions and other settlement terms, AviaGames agreed to pay Skillz and Big Run a total of million. On April 12, 2024, the Company and Big Run Studio entered into a Side Letter Agreement providing that a portion of the AviaGames settlement funds allocated to Big Run Studio be utilized to repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Loan and Security Agreement totaling million. See Note 4, Balance Sheet Components. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company and Big Run collectively received million from AviaGames pursuant to the settlement agreement. Of the million received, Skillz received million, million of which was for settlement of the amount outstanding under the Loan and Security Agreement with Big Run. Of the million allocated to Big Run under the Side Letter Agreement, Big Run received million net of the settlement of the Loan and Security Agreement. Beginning in March of 2025, AviaGames is required to pay Skillz an additional million annually over a period as royalty payments for AviaGames license of the 564 patent and its patent family. No portion of these payments are due to Big Run. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gain from the Litigation Settlement totaling million consisting of the net settlement payment of million, less the million received for settlement of the Loan and Security Agreement. The Company will record the million payments to be received in March 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 as a gain upon receipt of each payment. 
 
 Skillz vs. Voodoo SAS et. al. 
 On July 1, 2024, the Company filed suit against Voodoo SAS and two affiliate entities, Esport Newco SAS and Esport Newco US Corp. (collectively, "Voodoo") in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Company asserts that Voodoo uses computer algorithms or bots to fix the outcome of tournaments in favor of Voodoo in violation of the Lanham Act's prohibition of false advertising and New York's General Business Law 349 by advertising its mobile games as "fair," "skill-based," and for "real players only". On August 22, 2024, the Company brought a motion for a preliminary injunction and expedited discovery, and on September 18, 2024, Voodoo moved to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, to strike certain allegations. The Company s and Voodoo s motions were both mooted when the Company amended its complaint on October 2, 2024. On October 8, 2024, the Company renewed its motion for a preliminary injunction and expedited discovery based on the amended complaint, and Voodoo moved to dismiss the amended complaint on October 16, 2024. The Company expects the preliminary discovery motion and motion to dismiss will both be briefed in November 2024. 
 
 Hanna v. Paradise, et al 
 In March 2024, an alleged stockholder filed a putative derivative complaint, Hanna v. Paradise, et al. , in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company s current and former officers, directors, and certain stockholders. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties, and unjust enrichment arising out of the Company s March 2021 underwritten public offering. The complaint asserts that certain of the director and officer defendants breached fiduciary duties to the Company by allegedly inappropriately selling stock as part of the public offering; that the stockholder defendants aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duties; and that all defendants were unjustly enriched by their sales in the public offering. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and restitution for the Company from the defendants and the payment of costs and attorneys fees. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on June 6, 2024. Plaintiffs responded by voluntarily dismissing 55 of the stockholder defendants but opposing

 million in compensatory damages, and the Company recorded a loss contingency accrual of million and corresponding general and administrative expenses in such amount in the third quarter of 2021. In April 2022, the judge in the case determined, in light of the Company s post-verdict motions, that the instructions given to the jury at trial were defective. Accordingly, the judge ordered a new trial on damages or, alternatively, permitted the plaintiff to accept a reduced verdict in the amount of million, which the plaintiff subsequently levied from the Company s bank account. On May 25, 2022, the Company filed an appeal from the judgement seeking, in part, entry of judgement in the Company s favor notwithstanding the verdict. The plaintiff accepted the reduced verdict, and filed an appeal from the judgement on June 7, 2022, seeking in part, to reinstate the jury s original verdict (or an award less than the original verdict but greater than million final judgement) and challenge the trial court s conclusion that stock options are not wages, which was the basis for dismissing his wrongful termination and retaliation claims. Skillz filed its response and reply brief on July 7, 2023. On April 8, 2024, the Court of Appeals issued its decision, affirming the judgement of million but adding an additional million for a total award of million. The Court of Appeals also affirmed the dismissal of the wrongful termination and retaliation claims, holding that stock options are not wages. The Court of Appeal s decision became final, non-appealable and enforceable on May 20, 2024. The parties reached an agreement on payment details of the outstanding million judgement balance in July 2024, which the Company paid in the quarter ending September 30 2024. The parties have sought court intervention to assist in determining the disputed amount of post-judgement interest.

 In December 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Skillz Inc. 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan ). The 2020 Plan became effective upon consummation of the FEAC business combination and succeeds the Company s legacy equity incentive plans. Under the 2020 Plan, the Company may grant stock-based awards to purchase or directly issue shares of common stock to employees, directors and consultants. Options are granted at a price per share equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. Options granted are exercisable over a maximum term of years from the date of grant. RSUs are also granted under the 2020 Plan. These awards typically have a cliff vesting period of and continue to vest quarterly thereafter. The 2020 Plan also permits the Company to grant stock-based awards with performance or market conditions. In connection with the closing of the FEAC business combination, the Company entered into certain option agreements that include vesting conditions contingent upon the attainment of volume weighted average price targets related to the Company s Class A common stock on the NYSE. 
 
 The 2020 Plan permits the Company to deliver up to shares of common stock pursuant to awards issued under the 2020 Plan, consisting of shares which may be of Class A and/or Class B common stock, shares of Class

As of September 30, 2024, the performance goals for the award for the year-ending December 31, 2024 were not considered probable, therefore compensation expense was recognized for the three or nine months ending September 30, 2024. The awards for the years ending December 31, 2025 and 2026 were not considered granted for accounting purposes as the Company had not established the performance conditions for this award. 
 
 Founders Option Agreements 
 
 In December 2020, the Company entered into option agreements with each of the CEO and Chief Strategy Officer CSO (the Option Agreements awarding them options to purchase (i) shares of Class B common stock to the CEO and (ii) shares of Class A common stock to the CSO with an exercise price of .

 The million grant date fair value of the Founders Options was estimated using a model based on multiple stock price paths developed through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition targets may not be satisfied. The significant inputs to the valuation included the Class A stock price and the risk-free interest rate as of the grant date, as well as the estimated volatility of the Class A common stock. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized million and million, respectively, in compensation expense related to these grants. As of September 30, 2024, the unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to the Option Agreements was million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of years.

The Company s CODM received discrete Aarki financial information on a regular basis for purposes of evaluating its operating performance and allocating resources. Effective in the fourth quarter 2023, Aarki met the definition of an operating segment as defined in ASC 280, Segment Reporting ASC 280 ): (a) it is engaged in business activities from which it recognizes revenue and incurs expenses; (b) its operating results are regularly reviewed by the Company s CODM; and (c) its discrete financial information is available. This resulted in the establishment of operating segments Skillz and Aarki. The Company s Skillz operating segment meets the quantitative thresholds for a reportable segment under ASC 280. Therefore, since the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company presents financial information under ASC 280 for reportable segments.

(for purposes of this section, Skillz, we, us and our ). MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report ), and our financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors in our Annual Report and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Overview 
 
 We operate a marketplace that connects the world through competition, serving both developers and users. Our platform enables fair, fun and competitive gaming experiences and the trust we foster with users is the foundation upon which our community is built. We believe our marketplace benefits from a powerful network effect: compelling content attracts users to our platform, while the increasing size of our audience attracts more developers to create new interactive experiences on our platform. 
 
 Skillz was founded in 2012 by Andrew Paradise and Casey Chafkin with the vision to make eSports accessible to everyone possible. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the platform had over 0.8 million monthly active users MAUs and hosts an average of over 1.1 million daily tournaments, including 0.4 million paid entry daily tournaments, offering over 43.5 million in prizes each month. 
 
 Our culture is built upon a set of values established by our founders, aligning the Company and its employees in a common vision. Our seven values are: Honor; Mission; Collaboration; Productivity; Willingness; Frugality; and Balance. Our approach has focused on trust and fairness for users enabling game developers to focus on what they do best: build great content. 
 
 Our technology capabilities are industry-leading and provide the tools necessary for developers to compete with the largest and most sophisticated mobile game developers in the world. Our easy-to-integrate software development kit SDK and developer console allow our developers to monitor, integrate and update their games seamlessly over the air. We ingest and analyze over 300 data points from each game play session, enhancing our data-driven algorithms and LiveOps systems. Moreover, we have developed a robust platform enabling fun, fair and meaningful competitive gameplay. 
 
 Historically, our top games and related developers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue earned from the Skillz platform. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, The top two developers accounted for 81 of our revenue each year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the top two developers accounted for 80 of our revenue in each year. We expect that our top titles will rotate over time as more games generate success on the Skillz platform.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The following supplemental financial information table summarizes key operating metrics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These metrics are utilized by management and the Board to evaluate the operating performance of the Company and are key factors that directly impact the Company s revenue, costs and liquidity. Accordingly, we believe that they provide helpful supplemental information to investors in evaluating our operating results.

 (1) GMV or Gross Marketplace Volume means the total entry fees paid by users for contests hosted on Skillz s platform. Total entry fees include entry fees paid by end-users using cash depo sits, prior winnings from en d-users accounts that have not been withdrawn, and end-user incentives used to enter paid entry fee contests. 
 (2) Paying Monthly Active Users or PMAUs means the number of end-users who entered into a paid contest hosted on Skillz s platform at least once in a month, averaged over each month in the period. 
 (3) Monthly Active Users or MAUs means the number of playing end-users who entered into a paid or free contest hosted on Skillz s platform at least once in a month, averaged over each month in the period. 
 (4) Average GMV Per Paying Monthly Active User means the average GMV in a given month divided by Paying MAUs in that month, averaged over the period. 
 (5) Average GMV Per Monthly Active User means the average GMV in a given month divided by MAUs in that month, averaged over the period. 
 (6) Average Revenue Per Paying Monthly Active User or ARPPU means the average revenue in a given month divided by Paying MAUs in that month, averaged over the period and does not include a deduction for end-user incentives that are included in sales and marketing expense. 
 (7) Average Revenue Per Monthly Active User or ARPU means the average revenue in a given month divided by MAUs in that month, averaged over the period and does not include a deduction for end-user incentives that are included in sales and marketing expense. 
 (8) Amount reflects the average end-user incentives included in sales and marketing expense in a given month divided by PMAUs in that month, averaged over the period. 
 (9) Amount reflects the average end-user incentives included in sales and marketing expense in a given month divided by MAUs in that month, averaged over the period. 
 
 Engagement marketing is a sales and marketing expense representing rewards and awards that developers do not have a valid expectation of being offered to end-users to engage on the platform. Decreases in engagement marketing could result in lower revenue as paying users no longer receive those end-user incentives, which include Bonus Cash which can only be used to enter into paid contests. 
 
 User acquisition UA marketing is a sales and marketing expense to acquire new paying users to the platform. Assuming acquisition cost per user is constant, decreases in UA marketing expense typically result in lower revenue as a result of having fewer new paying users. The reduction in UA marketing and engagement marketing expenses has resulted in a substantial reduction in revenue and is expected to continue to result in a reduction in revenue. We are currently unable to reasonably estimate the quantitative impact, or range of impact, that reductions in UA marketing and engagement marketing will have on forward-looking revenue as a result of the number of interrelated factors impacting revenue, including, but not limited to, retention of existing users on the platform, ARPPU, efficacy of various engagement 
 
 32 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Our focus has continued to be on driving higher efficiency from our marketing investment by (1) reducing spend on low-return engagement marketing programs, which we expect will result in lower engagement marketing as a percentage of revenue and (2) driving UA efficiency by optimizing spend across networks and driving higher organic traffic. To the extent we reduce engagement marketing spend, we expect to reduce our Bonus Cash end-user incentives in proportion to such overall engagement marketing reduction. 

Our Financial Model 
 
 Skillz s financial model aligns the interests of gamers and developers, driving value for our stockholders. By monetizing through competition, our system eliminates friction that exists in traditional monetization models between the developer and the gamer. The more gamers enjoy our platform, the longer they play, creating more value for Skillz and our developers. By generating higher player to payor conversion, retention and engagement, we are able to monetize users at higher rates than what our developers would generate through advertisements or in-game purchases. 
 
 Our platform allows users to participate in fair competition, while rewarding developers who create games that keep players engaged. We generate revenue by receiving a percentage of player entry fees in paid (cash or Bonus Cash) contests, after deducting end-user prizes (i.e., winnings from the competitions), end-user incentives accounted for as reduction of revenue and the profit share paid to developers (the Take Rate ). GMV represents entry fees that may be paid using cash deposits, prior winnings (which includes Bonus Cash previously won and returned as winnings), and end-user incentives (which includes Bonus Cash that has been lost during the period). We offer incentives to end-users to drive traffic to the Skillz platform. End-user incentives that are offered on behalf of game developers, such as Ticketz (which can be redeemed for Bonus Cash) and initial deposit Bonus Cash, are accounted for as a reduction of revenue. End-user incentives for which game developers do not have a valid expectation of being offered to end-users to engage on the platform, such as limited-time Bonus Cash offers, are accounted for as a sales and marketing expense. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 
 The following table summarizes additional components of GMV, including average GMV per active user and average GMV per paying active user for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 The scale, growth and engagement of the users As we continue to acquire users, our ability to match comparable players, on both skill level and tournament template, in a fair and timely manner improves. Better matching leads to stronger engagement and the ability to create larger tournaments with more profitable take rates. This creates a stickier, more engaging, and continuously improving experience for our players, which in turn attracts more players to our platform, creating a positively reinforcing cycle leading to ever-improving gaming experiences. 
 The scale, growth and partnership of our developers We have created a platform that drives economic success for our developers. Our end-to-end platform allows developers to focus on creating games by automating and optimizing integral parts of their businesses from user acquisition and monetization to game optimization. Our built-in payments, analytics, customer support, and live operations platform enables our developers to consistently learn, grow, earn and share in our success. 
 Product-first philosophy and data science capabilities We have built a culture that puts product first, driving our impact with users and developers and then scaling marketing investment. Our easy-to-integrate SDK contains over 200 features in a less than 16-MB package which allows for over-the-air upgrades. Our intuitive Developer Console dashboard enables our developers to rapidly integrate and monitor the performance of their games. Our LiveOps system enables us to manage and optimize the user experience across the thousands of games on our platform. We collect over 300 data points during each gameplay session to feed our big data assets which augment all elements of our platform. Our key data science technologies drive our player rating and matching, anti-cheat and anti-fraud, and user experience personalization engine. 
 Our unit economics Our proprietary and highly scalable software platform produces revenue at a low direct cost (i.e. direct software and server costs), contributing to our gross margins. Once acquired, each user cohort contributes to revenue over its life. A cohort is all the users acquired in the period presented. A user is considered part of a cohort based on the first time they make a deposit and enter a paid tournament. Once a user is considered part of a cohort, they are always counted in that cohort. 

Key Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 
 Sk illz provides a service to the game developers aimed at improving the monetization of their game content. The monetization service provided by Skillz allows developers to offer multi-player competition to their end-users which increases end-user retention and engagement. 
 
 By utilizing the Skillz monetization services, game developers can enhance the player experience by enabling them to compete in head-to-head matches, live tournaments, leagues, and charity tournaments and increase player retention through referral bonus programs, loyalty perks, on-system achievements and Bonus Cash. Skillz provides developers with a SDK that they can download and integrate with their existing games. The SDK serves as a data interface between Skillz and the game developers that enables Skillz to provide monetization services to the developer. Specifically, thes e monetization services include end-user registration services, player matching, fraud and fair play monitoring, and billing and settlement services. The SDK and Skillz monetization services provide the following key benefits to the developers: 
 
 Streamlined game and tournament management allowing players to register with the developer to compete in games for prizes while earning Skillz loyalty perks; 
 Fair play in each tournament via the Skillz suite of fairness tools, including skill-based player matching and fraud monitoring; 
 Improved end-user retention by rewarding the most loyal players with Ticketz which can be redeemed in the Skillz virtual store and are earned in every match and can be redeemed for prizes or credits to be used towards future paid entry fee tournaments; 
 Marketing campaigns through main-stream online advertising networks and social media platforms to drive end-user traffic to developers games within the Skillz ecosystem;

 Systematic calls to end-user action via push notifications to users with game results, promotional offers, and time-sensitive actions; and 
 Process end-user payments, billings and settlements on behalf of the developer to enable players to connect their preferred payment method to deposit and enter into the game developers multi-player competitions for cash prizes. 
 
 Generally, end-users are required to deposit funds into their Skillz account in order to be eligible to participate in games for prizes. As part of its monetization services, Skillz is responsible for processing all end-user payments, billings and settlements on behalf of the game developer, such that the game developer does not have to collect directly from or make payments directly to the end-users. When the end-users enter into cash games, the end-users pay an entry fee using cash deposits, prior winnings in the end-users accounts and end-user incentives (specifically Bonus Cash). Skillz is entitled to a revenue share based on total entry fees for paid competitions, regardless of how they are paid, net of end-user prizes (i.e., winnings from the competitions) and other costs to provide monetization services. Revenue related to Bonus Cash is recognized only once when the Bonus Cash is lost. Skillz does not recognize the cost of Bonus Cash when it is returned to the user who won the competition. 
 
 Skillz typically withholds 16 to 20 of the total entry fees when distributing the prize money as a commission. That commission is shared between Skillz and the game developers; however, the game developers share is calculated solely based upon entry fees paid by net cash deposits received from end-users, adjusted for certain costs incurred by Skillz to provide monetization services. 

Costs and Expenses 
 
 Cost of Revenue 
 
 Our cost of revenue consists of variable costs. These include mainly (i) payment processing fees, (ii) customer support costs, (iii) direct software costs, (iv) amortization of internal use software and (v) server costs. 
 
 We incur payment processing costs on user deposits. We also incur costs directly related to servicing end-user support tickets on behalf of the game developer that are logged by users directly within the Skillz SDK. These support costs include an allocation of the facilities expense, such as rent, maintenance and utilities costs according to headcount, needed to service these tickets. We use a third party as our cloud computing service; we incur server and software costs as a direct result of running our SDK in our developers games. We also incur costs related to the amortization of intangible assets which include developed technology. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expenses consist of software development costs, composed mainly of product and platform development, server and software costs that support research and development activities, and to a lesser extent, allocation of rent, maintenance and utilities costs according to headcount. Personnel related expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. We expect research and development expenses will fluctuate both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the future. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of direct advertising costs, engagement marketing expenses that are not recorded as a reduction of revenue, UA marketing expenses and amortization of intangible assets which include customer relationships. Sales and marketing expenses also include allocations of rent, maintenance and utilities costs which are allocated according to headcount. Personnel related expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. We expect sales and marketing expenses will fluctuate both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the future. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses for our corporate, executive, legal, finance, human resources and other administrative functions, expenses for outside professional services, and an allocation for rent, maintenance and utilities costs which are allocated according to headcount. Personnel related expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses also include expenses related to a loss contingency accrual (for pending legal matters).

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 We expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease for the foreseeable future as we reposition the Company for profitability. We do not anticipate that we will grow headcount significantly and expect to reduce certain general and administrative expenses including professional service expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative services.

 Revenue 
 
 Revenue decreased by 11.9 million, or 33 , to 24.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 36.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the Company s player base as our monthly active users decreased 19 from 2023. This decrease reflects the decrease of our UA marketing and engagement marketing spend by 43 and 40 , respectively. The reduction in user acquisition and engagement marketing spend was driven to prioritize profitability over revenue growth. The Company has continued to intentionally reduce spend in order to achieve better user acquisition efficiency and eliminate lower-return engagement marketing programs. 
 
 Cost of Revenue 
 
 Cost of revenue decreased by 0.3 million, or 9 , to 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily driven by a reduction in payment processing and customer support personnel costs. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development costs decreased by 3.1 million, or 40 , to 4.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by a 2.3 million reduction in employee related costs such as salaries and bonuses as a result of lower headcount. Additionally, software expense decreased by 0.1 million and professional fees increased by 0.5 million.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Sales and Marketing 
 
 Sales and marketing costs decreased by 12.6 million, or 40 , to 19.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 31.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by 43 and 40 decreases in UA and engagement marketing spend, respectively. This intentional decrease was driven by the strategic decision to prioritize profitability over revenue growth. UA marketing and engagement marketing decreased by 3.2 million and 6.7 million, respectively. Additionally, employee related costs decreased by 1.9 million as a result of lower headcount. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative costs decreased by 6.2 million, or 26 , to 18.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 24.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by a 3.5 million decrease in legal fees as the Company is no longer actively in litigation with AviaGames and reached a settlement in the second quarter of 2024. Additionally, temporary staffing decreased by 1.1 million as we continue to reduce our reliance on contractors. Employee related costs decreased 4.0 million related to equity forfeitures from the resignation of our General Counsel and President and CFO in 2024. 

Interest income (expense), net 
 
 Interest income was 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to interest expense of 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 2.5 million in interest expense was primarily driven by the repurchase of debt in the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Provision for income taxes 
 
 Provision for income taxes increased by 23.0 thousand to 32.0 thousand in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 9.0 thousand in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by change in need for a valuation allowance, a decrease in foreign activities, and a reduction in expected state tax liabilities.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measure is useful in evaluating our operational performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial information, may be helpful to investors in assessing our operating performance. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding interest income (expense), net; change in fair value of common stock warrant liabilities; other income (expense), net; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax expense; and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time, including, but not limited to impairment charges, loss contingency accruals, gain on litigation settlements, restructuring charges and one-time nonrecurring expenses, as they are not indicative of business operations. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating its operating performance and is a similar measure reported by publicly-listed U.S. competitors, and regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. By providing this non-GAAP measure, we intend to provide investors with an additional tool to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company s financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating this measure. In addition, our presentation of this measure should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. 
 
 Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Segment Results 
 
 We have two reportable business segments; the Skillz segment and the Aarki segment. Our corporate operations primarily support Skillz and are included in the results for the Skillz segment. Likewise, Aarki has its own corporate operations, which are included in the Aarki segment. 
 
 The change from one to two reportable business segments was effective beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023. To provide comparability between reporting periods, results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 have been recast to reflect this change. 
 
 We evaluate the performance of our segments based on Segment Revenue and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is indicative of operational performance and is monitored by management to evaluate past performance and identify actions required to improve profitability. 
 
 The segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, the CODM are described in Note 15 Segment Reporting to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 In December 2021, the Company offered 300 million in aggregate principal senior secured notes due 2026 in a private offering. The notes were sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. Annual interest started to accrue from December 20, 2021 at a stated rate of 10.25 and will be payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2022. The notes will mature on December 15, 2026. We used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes. We may also use the proceeds for potential acquisitions of other companies, products, or technologies that we may identify in the future. The notes contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt, incur liens, make distributions to holders of our stock, make certain transactions with our affiliates, as well as certain financial covenants specified in the indentures. After giving effect to the September 1, 2022 and the 2023 open market repurchases of our senior secured notes, as of September 30, 2024, 129.7 million of the senior secured notes remained outstanding. We were in compliance with all covenants applicable to the notes as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our existing liquidity resources are sufficient to continue operating activities for at least one year past the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities. We also may invest in or acquire complementary businesses, applications or technologies. 
 
 The following table provides a summary of cash flow data (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 12,423 (59,486) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (185) 163,744 Net cash used in financing activities (12,823) (136,616) 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by the growth of our business primarily related to research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative activities. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth in personnel-related expenditures and fluctuations in accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 12.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects a net loss of 21.8 million (which includes 46.0 million received from the litigation settlement with AviaGames in the second quarter), non-cash expenses of 22.9 million related to stock-based compensation, and net cash inflows of 8.9 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms. 
 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, that adversely affects the Company s ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Policies U.S. GAAP such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. A material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the newly designed control activities operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are designed and operating effectively. 
 
 Notwithstanding the material weaknesses, management has concluded that our condensed consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in this Form 10-Q, in conformity with GAAP. 
 
 Material Weaknesses 
 
 As previously disclosed in our management s report on internal control over financial reporting within then Annual Report we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to the following: 
 
 1. Risk assessment 
 2. Information technology general controls 
 3. Internal control over financial reporting 

45 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Risk Assessment 
 
 In 2023, the Company continued to experience significant turnover of personnel involved in the design and operation of our system of internal control over financial reporting. While we backfilled vacated positions by engaging consultants and invested in hiring initiatives to recruit full-time employees, such hiring was not completed timely to offset the impact of the turnover we experienced. As a result, we were unable to maintain an effective risk assessment process based on the criteria established in the COSO Framework, due to the lack of sufficient trained personnel to adequately identify new or changing risks of misstatement to our financial statements and to design responsive internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 As a result, the Company was unable to reassess and adequately design and implement controls over financial reporting, including identification and review of disclosures and monitoring controls, and in providing the appropriate evidence of review of reconciliations, budgets, and key elements of the financial close process. 
 
 Information Technology General Controls (ITGCs) 
 
 ITGCs in the areas of access and program change over information technology (IT) systems that support the Company s financial reporting processes were not designed or operating effectively. Specifically, the Company did not maintain sufficient: (a) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs, and data to appropriate Company personnel; (b) program change management controls to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting financial information technology applications and underlying records are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately; and (c) program operations controls. As a result, the Company s related IT dependent manual and application controls that rely upon the affected ITGCs, or information coming from IT systems with affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective. 
 
 Internal Controls Over Accounting Processes 
 
 Controls designed to properly evaluate certain accounting processes, including where management review was involved, were not implemented or did not operate effectively due to the lack of sufficient documentation or evidence retained to demonstrate management s review over certain financial statement areas, including payroll, accounts receivable, tax liability, investments, end user liability, revenue recognition, and nonroutine transactions. 
 
 Material Weakness Remediation Efforts 
 
 Management, with oversight from the Audit Committee, will continue toward remediation of material weaknesses and reinforce the overall design and capability of our internal control environment. The following has been planned for implementation in management s ongoing efforts to remediate the identified material weaknesses: 
 
 Management will enhance and standardize policies and procedures across the Company to ensure consistency and performance of internal controls; 
 Management will continue to make strategic investments in personnel, external consultants, and available tools or systems to streamline / automate execution and documentation of internal controls throughout the Company; and 
 Management will continue to engage and educate personnel (including external consultants) throughout the Company on the importance of documenting and following internal controls. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except as noted above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 46 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. An internal controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgements in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
