 reportable segments, Machine Clothing ("MC") and Albany Engineered Composites ("AEC"), each overseen by a Segment President. These segments are reflective of how the Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is its Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), reviews operating results for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance. The Company has not aggregated operating segments for purposes of identifying reportable segments. 
 Machine Clothing: 
 The Machine Clothing segment supplies permeable and impermeable belts used in the manufacture of paper, paperboard, tissue and towel products, nonwovens, fiber cement and for several other industrial applications. Paper machine clothing products are customized, consumable products of technologically sophisticated design that utilize polymeric materials in a complex structure. We manufacture belts for each section of the paper machine and for every grade of paper. We sell our MC products directly to customer end-users in countries across the globe. MC's products, manufacturing processes, and distribution channels are substantially the same in each region of the world in which we operate. 
 On August 31, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Heimbach GmbH Heimbach ), a privately-held manufacturer of paper machine clothing and technical textiles. The financial results of the acquired company are included in the Machine Clothing reportable segment. 
 Albany Engineered Composites: 
 The Albany Engineered Composites segment provides highly engineered, advanced composite structures to customers in the commercial and defense aerospace industries. The segment includes Albany Safran Composites, LLC ASC ), in which our customer, the SAFRAN Group SAFRAN owns a percent noncontrolling interest. AEC, through ASC, is the exclusive supplier to the LEAP program of advanced composite fan blades and fan cases under a long-term supply contract, where revenue is determined by a cost-plus-fee agreement. The LEAP engine is used on the Airbus A320neo, Boeing 737 MAX, and COMAC 919 aircraft. AEC's largest aerospace customer is the SAFRAN Group and sales to SAFRAN (consisting primarily of fan blades and cases for CFM International's LEAP engine) accounted for approximately percent of the Company's consolidated Net revenues in 2023. 
 AEC net sales to SAFRAN were million and million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total of Accounts receivable, Contract assets and Noncurrent receivables due from SAFRAN amounted to million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Other significant programs for AEC include the Sikorsky CH-53K, F-35, JASSM, and Boeing 787 programs. AEC also supplies vacuum waste tanks for the Boeing commercial programs, and specialty components for the Rolls Royce lift fan on the F-35, as well as the fan case for the GE9X engine. For the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately percent of AEC revenues were related to U.S. government contracts or programs.

 Revenue Recognition: 
 Products and services provided under long-term contracts represent a significant portion of revenues in the Albany Engineered Composites segment and we account for these contracts over time, primarily using the percentage of completion (actual cost to estimated cost) method. That method requires significant judgment and estimation, which could be considerably different if the underlying circumstances were to change. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the period the change occurs. Changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts could be caused by increases or decreases in the contract value, revisions to customer delivery requirements, updated labor or overhead rates, factors affecting the supply chain, changes in the evaluation of contract risks and opportunities, or other factors. The cumulative changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts decreased operating income by million for the third quarter of 2024 and decreased operating income by million for the first nine months of 2024. The negative change in the estimated profitability in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by a few large complex programs, including approximately million for various CH-53K programs, approximately million on our Gulfstream program, approximately million on our F-35 program, and million, net, on all other programs. Adjustments in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts increased operating incomes by million and decreased operating income by million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. 
 We disaggregate revenue earned from contracts with customers for each of our business segments and product groups based on the timing of revenue recognition, and groupings used for internal review purposes.

 We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. Contracts in the MC segment are generally for periods of less than a year and certain contracts in the AEC segment are relatively short duration firm-fixed-price orders. Remaining performance obligations on contracts that had an original duration of greater than one year totaled billion and million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and related primarily to firm fixed price contracts in the AEC segment. Of the remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2024, we expect to recognize as revenue approximately million during 2024, million during 2025, million during 2026, and the remainder thereafter.

 Income tax expense for the quarter was computed in accordance with ASC 740-270, Income Taxes Interim Reporting. Under this method, loss jurisdictions which cannot recognize a tax benefit with regard to their generated losses are excluded from the annual effective tax rate calculation and their taxes will be recorded discretely in each quarter. 
 Our 2024 estimated annual effective tax rate primarily reflects the 21 federal tax rate, the impact of state and local taxation, the impact of taxation upon foreign operations, and forecasted permanent differences. Our actual effective tax rates were and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our actual effective tax rates were and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included a net discrete tax benefit of million. This discrete tax benefit is mostly attributable to the true-up of prior year estimated taxes and the release of a valuation allowance in a non-U.S. jurisdiction due to positive evidence indicating that a full valuation allowance was no longer required. The rate for the third quarter of 2024 was lower than the third quarter of 2023 mainly due to favorable discrete tax adjustments in the current period compared to unfavorable discrete tax adjustments in the prior period, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings compared to the prior period. 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a net discrete tax benefit of million. This discrete tax benefit is mostly attributable to the true-up for prior year estimated taxes, a net decrease in valuation allowances and a net decrease in uncertain tax positions. The rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the nine months ended September 30, 2023 mainly due to favorable discrete tax adjustments in the current period compared to unfavorable discrete tax adjustments in the prior period, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings compared to the prior period.

 In the second quarter of 2024, management performed the quantitative assessment approach in conducting its annual evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangibles and concluded that no impairment provision was required. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which management determined to be the business segment level. As part of the quantitative assessment, management used the income and market approach to determine fair value by considering projected cash flows and market multiples for the Machine Clothing reporting unit and the AEC reporting unit. Management performed the quantitative assessments and concluded that each reporting unit s fair value continued to significantly exceed its carrying value. In addition, there were no amounts at risk due to the estimated spread between the fair and carrying values. Accordingly, impairment charges were recorded. 
 In the third quarter, the Company revised its estimates and assumptions used in certain program estimates at completion of its AEC reporting unit. As a result, on October 3, 2024, the Company reported a preliminary update to its full year outlook to reflect revised revenue and profitability expectations for the AEC segment. As a result of the change in estimates of certain program revenues and profits, we performed a qualitative assessment of the AEC reporting unit s goodwill for impairment and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The excess of the fair value of the AEC reporting unit over its carrying value reduced approximately from previous quarters; and fair value continues to exceed the carrying value by more than .

 Interest Rate Swaps 
 From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate risk associated with its outstanding variable-interest rate borrowings. Such contracts are intended to economically hedge the reference rate component of future interest payments associated with outstanding borrowings under the Company s Amended Credit Agreement. In 2021, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for the period of October 17, 2022 through October 27, 2024, to hedge million of variable-interest rate indebtedness. The interest rate swaps are accounted for as a hedge of future cash flows, as further described in Note 15, Fair-Value Measurements . No cash collateral was received or pledged in relation to the swap agreements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the all-in rate on the million of debt was . Upon the expiration of the interest rate swap on October 28, 2024, our interest cost will increase significantly. Beginning in October 2024, our interest cost will be calculated using a floating rate based on the one-month term SOFR.

 Cash equivalents include short-term securities that are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable. These securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities. 
 The interest rate swaps are accounted for as hedges of future cash flows. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve, and is included in Other assets and/or Other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts determined to be due within one year are reclassified to Other current assets and/or Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on the interest rate swaps flow through the caption Derivative valuation adjustment in the Shareholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts accumulated in Other comprehensive income are reclassified as interest expense/(income), net when the related interest payments (that is, the hedged forecasted transactions), affect earnings. Interest expense/(income) related to payments under the active swap agreements totaled ) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and ) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We operate our business in many regions of the world, and currency rate movements can have a significant effect on operating results. Foreign currency instruments are entered into periodically and consist of foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts that are valued using quoted prices in active markets obtained from independent pricing sources. These instruments are measured using market foreign exchange prices and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Other current assets and Accrued liabilities, as applicable. Changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded as gains or losses within Other (income)/expense, net. 
 When exercised, the foreign currency instruments are net-settled with the same financial institution that bought or sold them. For all positions, whether options or forward contracts, there is a risk from the possible inability of the financial institution to meet the terms of the contracts and the risk of unfavorable changes in interest and currency rates, which may reduce the value of the instruments. We seek to mitigate risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of counterparties and by monitoring the currency exchange and interest rate markets while reviewing the hedging risks and contracts to ensure compliance with our internal guidelines and policies.

 claims as of September 30, 2024. 
 For the period ended September 30, 2024 
 We anticipate that additional claims will be filed against the Company and related companies in the future but are unable to predict the number and timing of such future claims. Due to the fact that information sufficient to meaningfully estimate a range of possible loss of a particular claim is typically not available until late in the discovery process, we do not believe a meaningful estimate can be made regarding the range of possible loss with respect to pending or future claims and therefore are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts already accrued for pending or future claims. 
 While we believe we have meritorious defenses to these claims, we have settled certain claims for amounts we consider reasonable given the facts and circumstances of each case. Our insurance carrier has defended each case and funded settlements under a standard reservation of rights. As of September 30, 2024, we had resolved, by means of settlement or dismissal, claims at a total cost of million. Of this amount, almost was paid by our insurance carrier, who has confirmed that we have approximately million of remaining coverage under primary and excess policies that should be available with respect to current and future asbestos claims. 
 The Company s subsidiary, Brandon Drying Fabrics, Inc. Brandon ), is also a separate defendant in many of the asbestos cases in which Albany is named as a defendant, despite never having manufactured any fabrics containing asbestos. While Brandon was defending against claims as of September 30, 2024, only claims have been filed against Brandon since January 1, 2012, and only in settlement costs have been incurred since 2001. Brandon was acquired by the Company in 1999 and has its own insurance policies covering periods prior to 1999. Since 2004, Brandon s insurance carriers have covered of indemnification and defense costs, subject to policy limits and a standard reservation of rights. 
 In some of these asbestos cases, the Company is named both as a direct defendant and as the successor in interest to Mount Vernon Mills Mount Vernon ). We acquired certain assets from Mount Vernon in 1993. Certain plaintiffs allege injury caused by asbestos-containing products alleged to have been sold by Mount Vernon many years prior to this acquisition. Mount Vernon is contractually obligated to indemnify the Company against any liability arising out of such products. We deny any liability for products sold by Mount Vernon prior to the acquisition of the Mount Vernon assets. Pursuant to its contractual indemnification obligations, Mount Vernon has assumed the defense of these claims. On this basis, we have successfully moved for dismissal in a number of actions. 
 We currently do not anticipate, based on currently available information, that the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations, or cash

 Failure to achieve or maintain anticipated profitable growth; 
 Failure to achieve our strategic initiatives and other goals, including, but not limited to, our sustainability goals; 
 In the Albany Engineered Composites segment, the estimates and expectations based on aircraft production rates provided by Airbus, Boeing and others; 
 In the Albany Engineered Composites segment, risks and uncertainties associated with the successful implementation and ramp up of significant new programs, including the ability to manufacture the products to the detailed specifications required and recover start-up costs and other investments in the programs; 
 In the Albany Engineered Composites segment, risks associated with changes in estimates and assumptions that could result in a decline in program gross margins or turn a profitable program into a loss program; 
 Adverse impacts from inflation, an economic slowdown or recession and by disruption in capital and credit markets that might impede our access to credit, increase our borrowing costs and impair the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers; 
 Expectations regarding our ability to attract, motivate, and retain the workforce necessary to execute our business strategy and other goals; 
 24 

Adverse impacts from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 
 Harm caused by large customer purchase reductions, payment defaults or contract non-renewal; 
 In the Albany Engineered Composites segment, future funding and compliance risks associated with our contracts with government entities, OEM customers or prime contractors on contracts with government entities; 
 Costly and disruptive legal disputes and settlements; 
 Future levels of indebtedness and capital expenditures; 
 Adverse impacts from changes in tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions; 
 Cybersecurity incidents or significant computer system compromises or data breaches; 
 Significant problems with information systems or networks; 
 Failure to adequately integrate the Heimbach Group companies into our business systems and processes within the expected timeframe or, failure to or delayed realization of anticipated benefits of the acquisition could adversely impact the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations; and 
 Other risks and uncertainties detailed in this report and other periodic reports. 
 Further information concerning important factors that could cause actual events or results to be materially different from the forward-looking statements can be found in the Business Environment Overview and Trends sections of this quarterly report, as well as in the Item 1A- Risk Factors section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we believe the expectations reflected in our other forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it is not possible to foresee or identify all factors that could have a material and negative impact on our future performance. The forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this report are made on the basis of our assumptions and analyses, as of the time the statements are made, in light of our experience and perception of historical conditions, expected future developments, and other factors believed to be appropriate under the circumstances. 
 Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, we disclaim any obligations or undertaking to publicly release any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained or incorporated by reference in this report to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based. 
 Business Environment Overview and Trends 
 
 Machine Clothing Segment 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced that Merle Stein was appointed President of the Machine Clothing MC segment, after serving as the Segment s Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Stein has considerable experience in the paper and pulp industries, significant knowledge of the MC business, and a strategic understanding of the markets it serves. Mr. Stein joined the Company in 2011. 
 The MC segment global backlog is stable and profitability continues to improve despite challenges in Europe, and, to a lesser degree, softness in China. North America is stable. The integration of Heimbach is on track with our internal plans. We transitioned Heimbach s Paper Machine Clothing PMC businesses onto our SAP platform in July, an integral step to integrate Heimbach into the MC business. 
 
 Albany Engineered Composites Segment 
 
 In the third quarter, the Company announced the appointment of Christopher Stone as President of the Albany Engineered Composites segment. Mr. Stone brings a deep knowledge of the Aerospace and Defense industry, and considerable operational experiences to his new role. He has held a wide range of leadership positions at public companies, with a focus in manufacturing and supply chain management, business operations, production control, logistics and organizational transformation. 
 
 The AEC segment continues to ramp-up production levels on commercial, defense, and space programs. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company updated its labor, material input and scrap assumptions and estimates of certain long-term programs that resulted in a negative cumulative change in estimated profitability in the amount of 22.4 
 25 

million. The negative cumulative change in profitability was primarily driven by a few large complex programs, including 13.3 million for various CH-53K programs, 6.5 million on our Gulfstream program, 2.2 million on our F-35 program, and 0.4 million, net on all other programs. 
 
 Boeing and Airbus SE had earlier announced increases in build rates in 2024 compared to 2023. During the year, both OEMs announced slower production rates than initially projected. We are seeing lower production rates on our Boeing 787 program causing AEC to slow its production on its content for this program for the remainder of 2024. Furthermore, although we have not yet experienced an adverse impact as a result of the Boeing Machinist strike, we are monitoring the strike and its potential impact on our future production rates. 
 
 Airbus SE has indicated that their expected ramp on the A320 will be pushed out beyond previous expectations. We have decreased our LEAP production forecast for the remainder of 2024; and we are working with our customer, Safran, to determine the appropriate production volumes for our LEAP production into 2025. 
 
 Also, please refer to the Business Environment Overview and Trends in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our Forms 10-Q previously filed with the SEC in 2024.

26 

Three month comparison 
 Net revenues increased 6.1 compared to the same period in 2023, driven by an increase in Net revenues from the Heimbach acquisition and stable Net revenues in AEC in line with the prior year, partially offset by lower organic Net revenues at MC. 
 MC's Net revenues increased 9.9 compared to the third quarter of 2023 driven by an increase in Heimbach Net revenues of 17.4 million. This was partially offset by 1.7 million of lower Net Revenues in the rest of the segment, due to lower revenues in packaging and publication grades. In addition, changes in currency translation rates had the effect of increasing Net revenues 0.7 million. 
 AEC's Net revenues were largely in line with the prior year, increasing 0.8 million or 0.7 , primarily driven by growth on certain commercial and space programs, which was partially offset by lower revenues on CH-53K and other defense programs. Changes in currency translation rates had an insignificant effect on Net revenues. 
 Nine month comparison 
 Net revenues increased 14.5 compared to the same period in 2023, driven by an increase of Net revenues from the Heimbach acquisition and higher Net revenues in AEC, partially offset by lower organic Net revenues at MC. 
 MC's Net revenues increased 17.3 compared to the same period in 2023 driven by an increase in Heimbach Net revenues of 95.0 million. This was partially offset by 11.2 million of lower Net revenues in the rest of the segment, driven primarily by weakness in publication globally, and in most grades in Europe, as well as decreased sales in packaging grades. Changes in currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing Net revenues 1.0 million. 
 AEC's Net revenues increased 10.6 , primarily driven by growth on certain commercial and space programs, which was partially offset by lower revenues on the F-35 program. Changes in currency translation rates had an insignificant effect on Net revenues. 
 Gross Profit 
 The following table summarizes Gross profit by business segment: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands, except percentages) 
 2024 2023 2024 2023 Machine Clothing 88,921 79,257 262,449 238,031 Albany Engineered Composites 
 1,463 22,578 49,004 65,826 Total 90,384 101,835 311,453 303,857 of Net revenues 30.3 36.2 33.0 36.9 
 Three month comparison 
 The decrease in 2024 Gross profit, as compared to the same period last year, was driven by increased cost assumptions that adjusted the expected profitability of certain long-term contracts in the AEC segment. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was as follows: 
 MC's gross profit margin increased from 47.6 in 2023 to 48.6 in 2024, primarily attributable to reduced input costs. 
 AEC's gross profit margin decreased from 19.7 in 2023 to 1.3 in 2024, driven primarily by cumulative changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts, which decreased gross profit by 22.4 million in 2024, as compared to a increase of 0.9 million during the same period last year. 
 Nine month comparison 
 The decrease in Gross profit during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was driven by increased cost assumptions that adjusted the expected profitability of certain long-term contracts in the AEC segment. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was as follows: 
 MC's gross profit margin decreased from 49.7 in 2023 to 46.7 in 2024. This margin decrease was primarily attributable to lower gross margin at Heimbach. 
 AEC's gross profit margin decreased from 19.1 in 2023 to 12.8 in 2024, driven primarily by cumulative changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts, which decreased gross profit by 28.3 million in 
 27 

2024, as compared to a decrease of 4.1 million during the same period last year, partially offset by a favorable shift in revenue mix to commercial and space programs. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative ("SG A") 
 The following table summarizes SG A expenses by business segment: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands, except percentages)

 52,097 51,975 162,447 147,214 of Net revenues 17.5 18.5 17.2 17.9 
 Three month comparison 
 Consolidated SG A expenses increased 0.2 as compared to 2023, however, as a percentage of Net revenues, SG A expenses decreased from 18.5 in 2023 to 17.5 in 2024. 
 MC SG A expenses increased 5.7 million as compared to 2023, with a 3.9 million increase related to Heimbach, a 1.2 million increase due to changes in currency translation rates, and a 0.6 million increase in professional, consulting, and personnel-related costs. 
 In AEC, SG A expenses decreased 1.6 million, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation and personnel-related costs. 
 Corporate SG A expenses decreased 4.0 million, principally due to lower incentive compensation and personnel-related costs. 
 Nine month comparison 
 Consolidated SG A expenses increased 10.3 as compared to 2023, however, as a percentage of Net revenues, SG A expenses decreased from 17.9 in 2023 to 17.2 in 2024. 
 The overall increase in SG A expenses in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was due to the net effect of the following: 
 MC SG A expenses increased 17.6 million as compared to 2023, with a 20.4 million increase related to Heimbach and a 0.9 million increase related to personnel-related and travel costs, partially offset by a 3.7 million decrease due to changes in currency translation rates. 
 In AEC, SG A expenses decreased 2.0 million, driven by a 0.8 million decrease in personnel-related costs, a 0.8 million decrease in marketing costs, and a 0.4 million decrease in professional and consulting fees. 
 Corporate SG A expenses remained largely in line with the prior year, decreasing 0.3 million.

Three month comparison 
 Consolidated Technical and research expenses increased 11.7 as compared to 2023 and as a percentage of Net revenues increased from 3.5 in 2023 to 3.6 in 2024. 
 MC Technical and research expenses increased 1.0 million as compared to 2023 due to the addition of Heimbach. 
 AEC Technical and research expenses increased 0.1 million as compared to 2023, due to increases in research material and labor costs. 
 Nine month comparison 
 Consolidated Technical and research expenses increased 16.7 as compared to 2023, but as a percentage of Net revenues remained unchanged at 3.7 in both 2023 and 2024. 
 MC Technical and research expenses increased 3.9 million as compared to 2023, with a 4.3 million increase related to Heimbach, which was partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in personnel-related costs. 
 AEC Technical and research expenses increased 1.2 million as compared to 2023 due to increases in research material and labor costs. 
 Restructuring Expense, net 
 In addition to the items discussed above affecting Gross profit, SG A and Technical and research expenses, Operating income was affected by Restructuring expense, net, of 2.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.1 million in in the same period of 2023; and 6.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.2 million in the same period in 2023. 
 The following table summarizes Restructuring expenses, net by business segment: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Machine Clothing 2,207 82 3,294 227 Albany Engineered Composites 34 3,144 Corporate expenses 31 146 Consolidated total 2,272 82 6,584 227 
 At MC, restructuring actions were taken in the second and third quarters of 2024 to cease operations at the Company's MC forming fabric manufacturing facility in Chungju, South Korea, and at the Company's Heimbach engineered fabric manufacturing facility in Rochdale, UK. This was the principal driver of 3.3 million in Restructuring expenses, net for the first nine months of 2024 related to workforce reductions, fixed asset impairments and related costs, as well as charges of 1.3 million in Costs of goods sold for the write-off of inventory. We expect to incur additional restructuring expenses related to these actions throughout the remainder of the year. 
 At AEC, restructuring activities were related to reductions in the workforce at various AEC locations, which resulted in restructuring expenses of 3.1 million for the first nine months of 2024. 
 Restructuring expenses incurred at MC and AEC during 2023 were not significant. 
 Operating Income 
 The following table summarizes operating income/(loss) by business segment:

 Interest Expense/(Income), net 
 Interest expense/(income), net, decreased over the prior year primarily due to lower average debt balances, in part offset by less interest income earned on cash equivalents during the current year. See Note 14. Financial Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of borrowings and interest rates. 
 Other (Income)/Expense, net 
 Other (income)/expense, net, included foreign currency related transactions, which resulted in losses of 1.8 million and 0.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to losses of 0.5 million and gains of 3.6 million in the same periods last year. In addition, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments included gains of 0.5 million and losses of 3.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to losses of 0.7 million and 0.6 million in the same period last year, driven by currency rate movements, most notably the Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso. Net periodic pension and postretirement costs, other than service costs, were 0.7 million and 2.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to benefits of 0.1 million and 0.3 million in the same period last year. Other (income)/expense, net, also included net losses of 0.7 million from the divestiture of assets related to Heimbach during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as well as bank fees, amortization of debt issuance costs, and rental income.

The jurisdictional location of earnings is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year. The rate impact of this component is influenced by the specific location of non-U.S. earnings and the level of our total earnings. From period to period, the jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business, as well as the extent and location of other income and expense items, such as pension settlement and restructuring charges. 
 The tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as the income tax rate in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions and the mix of pre-tax income earned in those jurisdictions. The tax rate is also affected by U.S. tax costs on foreign pre-tax earnings, and by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year. The Company s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 6.6 , lower compared to 25.3 for the same period in 2023, mainly due to favorable discrete tax adjustments in the current period exceeding favorable discrete tax adjustments in the prior period. The favorable discrete benefits in the third quarter of 2024 were partially offset by an unfavorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings compared to the prior period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 23.9 , lower compared to 33.0 for the same period in 2023, mainly due to favorable discrete tax adjustments in the current period compared to unfavorable discrete tax adjustments in the prior period, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings compared to the prior period. For more information, see Note 6 , Income Taxes, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a new global minimum tax of 15 percent intended to be effective on January 1, 2024. While the U.S. has not yet adopted the Pillar Two rules, various other governments around the world are enacting legislation. As currently designed, Pillar Two will ultimately apply to our worldwide operations. Although we do not expect these rules to materially increase our global tax costs in 2024, there remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two model rules. We will continue to monitor U.S. and global legislative action related to Pillar Two for potential impacts. 

Segment Results of Operations 
 Machine Clothing Segment 
 The MC segment accounted for 61 and 60 of our consolidated revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. A summary of selected financial results for MC is as follows: 
 Review of Operations 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands, except percentages) 
 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net revenues 183,033 166,588 561,828 479,027 Gross profit 
 88,921 79,257 262,449 238,031 of Net revenues 48.6 47.6 46.7 49.7 SG A expenses 
 28,191 22,442 83,813 66,197 Technical and research expenses 
 7,042 6,023 22,066 18,207 Operating income 51,481 50,710 153,276 153,400 
 Net Revenues 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Net revenues increased by 9.9 as compared to the prior year, driven by an increase in Heimbach Net revenues of 17.4 million. This was partially offset by 1.7 million of lower organic Net Revenues in the rest of the segment, due to decreased sales in packaging and publication grades. In addition, changes in currency translation rates had the effect of increasing Net revenues 0.7 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net revenues increased by 17.3 as compared to the prior year, driven by an increase in Heimbach Net revenues of 95.0 million. This was partially offset by 11.2 million of lower organic Net revenues in the rest of the segment, driven primarily by weakness in publication globally, and in most grades in Europe, as well as decreased sales in packaging grades. Changes in currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing Net revenues 1.0 million. 
 Gross Profit 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Gross profit increased by 9.7 million and the gross profit margin increased from 47.6 in 2023 to 48.6 in 2024. This margin increase was primarily attributable to reduced input costs. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Gross profit increased by 24.4 million as compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by the higher sales noted above; however, gross profit margin decreased from 49.7 in 2023 to 46.7 in 2024. This margin decrease was primarily driven by lower gross margins at Heimbach. 
 Operating Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Operating income was largely in line with the prior year, increasing 0.8 million or 1.5 . The strong Gross profit performance was largely offset by increased SG A and Technical and Research expenses, primarily at Heimbach locations. SG A expenses increased 5.7 million as compared to 2023, with a 3.9 million increase related to Heimbach, a 1.2 million increase due to changes in currency translation rates, and a 0.6 million increase in professional, consulting, and personnel-related costs. Technical and research expenses increased 1.0 million as compared to 2023 due to the addition of Heimbach. In addition, Restructuring expenses increased 2.2 million related to recent announcements to cease operations at multiple manufacturing facilities, further reducing Operating income. 
 31 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Operating income was also largely in line with the prior year, decreasing 0.1 million or 0.1 .The strong Gross profit performance was largely offset by increased SG A and Technical and Research expenses, primarily at Heimbach locations. SG A expenses increased 17.6 million as compared to 2023, with a 20.4 million increase related to Heimbach and a 0.9 million increase related to personnel-related and travel costs, partially offset by a 3.7 million decrease due to changes in currency translation rates. Technical and research expenses increased 3.9 million as compared to 2023, with a 4.3 million increase related to Heimbach, which was offset by a 0.4 million decrease in personnel-related costs. In addition, Restructuring expenses increased 3.3 million related to recent announcements to cease operations at multiple manufacturing facilities, further reducing Operating income. 
 Albany Engineered Composites ("AEC") Segment 
 The AEC segment accounted for 39 and 40 of our consolidated revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. A summary of selected financial results for AEC is as follows: 
 Review of Operations 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands, except percentages) 
 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net revenues 115,353 114,518 381,882 345,298 Gross profit 
 1,463 22,578 49,004 65,826 of Net revenues 1.3 19.7 12.8 19.1 SG A expenses 
 7,920 9,519 24,228 26,270 Technical and research expenses 
 3,802 3,685 13,303 12,096 Operating income (10,293) 9,374 8,329 27,460 
 Net Revenues 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Net revenues increased 0.7 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by growth on certain commercial and space programs, which was partially offset by lower revenues on CH-53K and other defense programs. Changes in currency translation rates had an insignificant effect on Net revenues. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net revenues increased 10.6 , primarily driven by growth on certain commercial and space programs, which was partially offset by lower revenues on the F-35 program. Changes in currency translation rates had an insignificant effect on Net revenues. 
 AEC has contracts with certain customers, including its contract for the LEAP program, where revenue is determined by a cost-plus-fee agreement. Revenue earned under these arrangements accounted for approximately 40 percent of segment revenue for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. 
 In addition, AEC has long-term contracts in which the selling price is fixed. In accounting for those contracts, we estimate the profit margin expected at the completion of the contract and recognize a pro-rata share of that profit during the course of the contract using a cost-to-cost approach. Changes in estimated contract profitability will affect revenue and gross profit when the change occurs, which could have a significant favorable or unfavorable effect on revenue and gross profit in any reporting period. For contracts with anticipated losses, a provision for the entire amount of the estimated remaining loss is charged against income in the period in which the loss becomes known. Contract losses are determined considering all direct and indirect contract costs, exclusive of any selling, general or administrative cost allocations, which are treated as period expenses. Expected losses on projects include losses on contract options that are probable of exercise, excluding profitable options that often follow. 
 Gross Profit 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Gross profit decreased 21.1 million as compared to the same period last year, and as a percentage of revenues decreased from 19.7 in 2023 to 1.3 in 2024. This decrease in Gross profit was driven primarily by changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts, which decreased gross profit by 22.4 million in 2024 due to increased cost assumptions as well as the impact of suspended production at a key customer. For the 2023 year, adjustments in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts increased Gross profit 0.9 million. 
 32 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Gross profit decreased 16.8 million as compared to the same period last year, and gross profit margin decreased from 19.1 in 2023 to 12.8 in 2024. This decrease in Gross profit was driven primarily by changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts, which decreased gross profit by 28.3 million in 2024 due to increased cost assumptions as well as the impact of suspended production at a key customer, partially offset by a favorable shift in revenue mix to commercial and space programs. For the 2023 year, adjustments in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts decreased Gross profit 4.1 million. 
 Operating Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Operating income decreased 19.7 million, principally due to reduced Gross profit as noted above. This was partially offset by a decrease in SG A expenses of 1.6 million, primarily driven by decreased incentive compensation and personnel-related costs. Technical and research expenses and Restructuring expenses remained largely in line with the prior year. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Operating income decreased 19.1 million, principally due to reduced Gross profit as noted above. This was partially offset by a decrease in SG A expenses of 2.0 million, driven by a 0.8 million decrease in personnel-related costs, a 0.8 million decrease in marketing costs, and a 0.4 million decrease in professional and consulting fees. Technical and research expenses increased 1.2 million as compared to 2023 due to increases in research material and labor costs. Restructuring activities related to reductions in the workforce at various AEC locations resulted in restructuring expenses of 3.1 million, further reducing Operating income. 
 Working Capital, Liquidity and Capital Structure 
 Cash Flow Summary 
 Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 
 2024 2023 Net income 70,310 81,066 Depreciation and amortization 67,003 54,778 Changes in working capital (a) 7,700 (58,130) Changes in other noncurrent liabilities and deferred taxes (7,569) (4,866) Other operating items 2,541 964 Net cash provided by operating activities 139,985 73,812 Net cash used in investing activities (61,053) (182,596) Net cash used in financing activities 
 (121,773) (10,839) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (3,357) (647) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
 (46,198) (120,270) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 173,420 291,776 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 
 127,222 171,506 
 (a) Includes Accounts receivable, Contract assets, Inventories, Accounts payable, and Accrued liabilities. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the first nine months of 2024 was 140.0 million, compared to 73.8 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by improved levels of working capital at both segments, but was most pronounced at AEC, which invested a much more significant amount in working capital during 2023 related to the expanded CH-53K scope of work and the build-up of inventory in the LEAP program as compared to 2024. 
 Net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures totaling 62.1 million and 49.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, including investments in new aerospace programs and to improve productivity in our MC segment. In addition, investing activities during the prior year included the acquisition of Heimbach, headquartered in D ren, Germany, for net cash of 133.5 million, funded using cash on hand. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 121.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 10.8 million for the first nine months of 2023. The significant increase in net cash used during 2024 was due to increased principal payments on debt and increased dividends paid to shareholders. 

33 

Liquidity and Capital Structure 
 We finance our business activities principally with cash generated from operations and borrowings, largely through our revolving credit agreement as discussed below. Our subsidiaries outside of the United States may also maintain working capital lines with local banks. 
 Under our 800 million unsecured committed Amended Credit Agreement, 360.0 million of borrowings were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. In addition, we have borrowings outstanding at our Heimbach subsidiary of 2.2 million, of which 0.6 million was considered current. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 127.2 million and available borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement of 440.0 million, for a total liquidity of approximately 567.2 million. We believe cash flows from operations and the availability of funds under our Amended Credit Agreement will be adequate to fund our operations and business needs over the next twelve months. For more information on credit agreements, see Note 14. Financial Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 106.5 million of our total cash and cash equivalents were held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. The accumulated undistributed earnings of the Company s foreign operations not targeted for repatriation to the U.S. were in excess of 120.0 million, as of September 30, 2024 and are intended to remain indefinitely invested in foreign operations. Our cash planning strategy includes repatriating current earnings in excess of working capital requirements from certain countries in which our subsidiaries operate. While we have been successful in such endeavor to date, there can be no assurance that we will be able to cost effectively repatriate funds in the future. Repatriating such cash from certain jurisdictions, which is currently considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, may also result in additional taxes. 
 We have also returned cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the first nine months of 2024, we paid 24.4 million in dividends and had no share repurchases. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company is party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, including certain guarantees. The Company provides financial assurance, such as payment guarantee and letters of credit and surety bonds, primarily to support workers compensation programs and customs clearance, of less than 12 million. There were no material changes in the Company s off-balance sheet arrangements during 2024. 

34 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We have market risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in these rates as discussed below. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We have manufacturing plants and sales transactions worldwide and, therefore, are subject to foreign currency risk. This risk is composed of both potential losses from the translation of foreign currency financial statements and the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions. To manage this risk, we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts either to hedge the net assets of a foreign investment or to provide an economic hedge against future cash flows. The total net assets of non-U.S. operations and long-term intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies subject to potential loss amount to approximately 693.3 million. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to 69.3 million. Furthermore, related to foreign currency transactions, we have exposure to various nonfunctional currency balances totaling 146.4 million. This amount includes, on an absolute basis, exposures to assets and liabilities held in currencies other than our local entities functional currencies. On a net basis, we had 52.4 million of foreign currency assets as of September 30, 2024. As currency rates change, these nonfunctional currency balances are revalued, and the corresponding adjustment is recorded in the income statement. A hypothetical change of 10 in currency rates could result in an adjustment to the income statement of approximately 5.2 million. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations with respect to our variable rate debt, depending on general economic conditions. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, we had 10.1 million in variable rate debt: 
 Assuming borrowings were outstanding for an entire year, an increase of one percentage point in weighted average interest rates would increase interest expense by 0.1 million. To manage interest rate risk, we may periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the interest rates on variable debt to a specific rate for a period of time. Our current interest rate swap agreements expire in October 2024, which will result in a significant increase in our interest cost, which will be calculated using a floating rate based on the one-month term SOFR at that time, which was 5.06 at the time of our last borrowing, which was September 19, 2024. See Note 14. Financial Instruments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 a) Disclosure controls and procedures. 
 The principal executive officer and principal financial officer, based on their evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective for ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in filed or submitted reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
 In July of 2024, we implemented the Company s version of SAP at certain Heimbach facilities, which in turn, resulted in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. While we expect SAP to strengthen our internal controls at Heimbach by automating certain manual process and standardizing business processes and reporting, we will continue to monitor our internal controls in each of the affected facilities. 
 Other than discussed above, there were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during 
 35 

the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The information set forth above under Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies in Item 1, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 We made no share purchases during the third quarter of 2024. 
 On October 25, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase shares of up to 200 million through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, and to determine the prices, times and amounts. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or terminated at any time at the Company's discretion. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. The timing and amount of any share repurchases will be based on the Company s liquidity, general business and market conditions, debt covenant restrictions and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities and capital structure. In total, the Company has repurchased 1,308,003 shares for a total cost of 109.4M, of which 1,022,717 shares were repurchased in 2022 for 85.1 million and 285,286 shares were repurchased in 2021 for 24.3 million. We currently remain authorized to repurchase shares of up to 90.6 million. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not Applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or executive officers or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Albany International Corp. securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.
