 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (Unaudited) 

million and used cash in operations of approximately million. These factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable
to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis
that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 

The
Company has evaluated the significance of the uncertainty regarding the Company s financial condition in relation to its ability
to meet its obligations, which has raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. While it
is very difficult to estimate the Company s future liquidity requirements, the Company believes if it is unable to obtain additional
financing, existing cash resources will not be sufficient to enable it to fund the anticipated level of operations through one year from
the date the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. There can be no assurances that the Company
will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms. In the event the Company does not secure additional financing, the Company
will be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate some or all of its discretionary spending, which could adversely affect the Company s
business prospects, ability to meet long-term liquidity needs and the ability to continue operations. 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regarding interim financial reporting.
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Accordingly, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024 (the 2023 Annual Report ). The consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein, was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. 

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to
fairly present the Company s financial position and results of operations for the interim periods reflected. Except as noted, all
adjustments contained herein are of a normal recurring nature. Results of operations for the fiscal periods presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of fiscal year-end results. 

million. At December 31, 2023 total cash equivalents which consist
of money market funds, amounted to approximately . 

Management
generally determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase. We classify these investments as short-term
investments, as part of current assets, based upon our ability and intent to use any and all of these investments as necessary to satisfy
liquidity requirements that may arise from our business. Investments are carried at fair value with the unrealized holding gains and
losses reported in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, total short-term investments which consist of US treasuries and US government agencies, amounted to approximately 0 and 
million, respectively. 

The
carrying amounts of the Company s other financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, short term investments,
prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity
of these instruments. 

The
carrying amount of the Company s warrant liability of and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively,
was based on Level 3 measurements. 

As
a result of the reverse stock-split, every thirty (30) shares of issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined into
one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share. No fractional shares will be issued
in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares of common stock
will be entitled to receive their pro-rata portion of the net proceeds obtained from the aggregation and sale by the exchange agent of
the fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock-split (reduced by any customary brokerage fees, commission and other expenses).
The reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the effective date of the reverse stock-split from
 shares to shares, subject to minor adjustments due to the treatment of fractional shares. The number of authorized
shares of common stock remains unchanged at shares. 

Proportionate
adjustments have been made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased upon exercise
of outstanding stock options and warrants for the Company s common stock, and to the number of shares of common stock reserved
for future issuance pursuant to the Company s 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan. 

All
share and per share information within this report have been adjusted to retroactively reflect the reverse stock-split as of the earliest
period presented.

shares of the Company s common stock (the 2023 Common Warrants ), and placement agent warrants to purchase
up to shares of the Company s common stock (the 2023 Placement Agents Warrants ). 

The
2023 Common Warrants and the 2023 Placement Agents Warrants (collectively the 2023 Warrants ), provide for a value calculation
for the warrants using the Black Scholes model in the event of certain fundamental transactions. The fair value calculation provides
for a floor on the volatility amount utilized in the value calculation at or greater. The Company has determined this provision
introduces leverage to the holders that could result in a value that would be greater than the settlement amount of a fixed-for-fixed
option on the Company s own equity shares. Therefore, pursuant to ASC 815, the Company has classified the 2023 Warrants as a liability
in its consolidated balance sheet. The classification of the 2023 Warrants, including whether they should be recorded as liability or
as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. 

The
2023 Warrants were initially recorded at a fair value at million at the grant date, and upon the closing of placement, was recorded
as a cost of capital. The fair value of the 2023 Warrants classified as a liability in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheets and will be re-measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in the unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations until they are either exercised or expired.

that contained a fundamental transaction provision that could give rise to an obligation to pay cash to the warrant holder upon occurrence
of certain change in control type events. In accordance with ASC 480, the fair value of the 2020 Warrants is classified as a liability
in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and will be re-measured at the end of every reporting period with
the change in value reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations until they are either exercised or expire.

Stock 

2024
Common Stock Offering 

On
May 23, 2024, the Company received gross proceeds of approximately million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering
expenses of in relation to a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement signed on May 21, 2024, between the Company and institutional investors (the Purchasers for the issuance and sale,
in a registered direct offering, of shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share (the 2024 Shares ).
In a concurrent private placement, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers warrants to purchase shares of the Company s
common stock (the 2024 Common Warrants ). In addition, the Company issued warrants to the placement agent to purchase 
shares of common stock (the 2024 Placement Agents Warrants ). The 2024 Common Warrants have an exercise price equal to 
per share, and the 2024 Placement Agents Warrants have an exercise price equal to per share, both are exercisable commencing
six months following issuance, and have a term of exercise equal to five years following the initial exercise date. The 2024 Shares and
2024 Common Warrants were sold at an offering price of per share and accompanying 2024 Common Warrant. 

Pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed, with certain exceptions, for a period of 60 days following the closing of the offering
not to issue, enter into an agreement to issue or announce the issuance or proposed issuance of the 2024 Shares or any other securities
convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, shares of the Company s common stock. The Company has also agreed for a period
of one year following the closing date of the offering not to (i) issue or agree to issue equity or debt securities convertible into,
or exercisable or exchangeable for, shares at a conversion price, exercise price or exchange price which floats with the trading price
of the 2024 Shares or which may be adjusted after issuance upon the occurrence of certain events or (ii) enter into any agreement, including
an equity line of credit, whereby the Company may issue securities at a future-determined price. 

The
Company determined that under ASC 815-40, the 2024 Common Warrants and the 2024 Placement Agent Warrants do not contain a clause that
adjusts the exercise price based on circumstances not considered to be within the Company s control and are considered indexed
to the Company s own stock and eligible for an exception from derivative accounting. Accordingly, the fair value of the 2024 Common
Warrants and the 2024 Placement Agent Warrants are classified as equity. 

2023
Private Placement of Common Stock 

On
January 4, 2023, the Company received gross proceeds of million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses
of in relation to a purchase agreement signed on December 30, 2022, between the Company and an institutional investor for the
issuance and sale, in a registered direct offering, of shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share
(the 2023 Shares ), pre-funded warrants to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock (the Pre-Funded
Warrants ), warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock (the 2023 Common
Warrants and placement agent warrants to purchase up to of the Company s common stock (the 2023 Placement
Agents Warrants ). The 2023 Common Warrants have an exercise price equal to per share, are exercisable commencing six months
following issuance, and have a term of exercise equal to five years following the initial issuance date. The Pre-Funded Warrants had
an exercise price of per share, are immediately exercisable and could be exercised at any time after their original issuance until
such Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised in full. The 2023 Placement Agents Warrants have an exercise price equal to per share,
are exercisable commencing six months following issuance, and have a term of exercise equal to five years following the initial issuance
date. The 2023 Shares and 2023 Common Warrants were sold at an offering price of per share and accompanying 2023 Common Warrant
and the Pre-Funded Warrants and 2023 Common Warrants were sold at an offering price of per Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying
2023 Common Warrant. 

The
2023 Common Warrants and the 2023 Placement Agents Warrants contained a clause not considered to be within the Company s control.
The Company determined that the provision represented a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed 
option as defined under ASC 815-40, and thus the 2023 Common Warrants and the 2023 Placement Agent Warrants are not considered indexed
to the Company s own stock and not eligible for an exception from derivative accounting. Accordingly, the 2023 Common Warrants
and the 2023 Placement Agent Warrants were classified as a warrant liability, and million of the initial common stock offering was
classified as a warrant liability (see Note 5 Warrant Liability). 

Common
Stock Issued for Services 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued shares of common stock with a fair value of to members of
the Company s Board of Directors (the Board ), employees, and consultants. The shares were valued at the respective
date of the agreements.

As
a result of reverse stock splits in previous years and the agreement terms for adjusting the rights of the related shares, the 
shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not currently convertible, have no voting rights, and in the event of liquidation, the holders
of the Series C Preferred Stock would not participate in any distribution of the assets or surplus funds of the Company. The holders
of Series C Preferred Stock also are not currently entitled to any dividends if and when declared by the Board. No dividends to holders
of the Series C Preferred Stock were declared or unpaid through September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

February 16, 2021, the Board designated shares of Series K preferred stock, par value (the Series K Preferred Stock ). 

Shares
of the Series K Preferred Stock are convertible at any time, at the option of the holders, into shares of the Company s common
stock at an effective conversion rate of shares of common stock for each share of Series K Preferred. Shares of the Series K Preferred
Stock have the same voting rights as the shares of the Company s common stock, with the holders of the Series K Preferred Stock
entitled to vote on an as-converted-to-common stock basis, subject to the beneficial ownership limitation, together with the holders
of the Company s common stock on all matters presented to the Company s stockholders. The Series K Preferred Stock are not
entitled to any dividends (unless specifically declared by the Board) but will participate on an as-converted-to-common-stock basis in
any dividends to the holders of the Company s common stock. In the event of the Company s dissolution, liquidation or winding
up, the holders of the Series K Preferred Stock will be on parity with the holders of the Company s common stock and will participate,
on a on an as-converted-to-common stock basis, in any distribution to holders of the Company s common stock.

TWF
Global Matter 

On
May 24, 2023, TWF Global, LLC TWF filed a Complaint in the California Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles naming
the Company as defendant. The Complaint alleges that TWF is the holder of two Convertible Promissory Notes Notes and
that the Company did not deliver shares of common stock due on conversion in February 2021. TWF was seeking per diem liquidated damages
based on the terms of alleged Notes. On July 14, 2023, the Company filed a motion to dismiss for improper forum because the terms of
the Notes, as alleged, require disputes to be filed in New York state and federal courts. TWF voluntarily dismissed its Complaint before
the California Superior Court of Los Angeles without prejudice. The Company subsequently filed a Summons and Complaint for Interpleader
against TWF and Z-One LLC before the Supreme Court of the State of New York County of New York, asking the Supreme Court to determine
if the Company s shares of common stock are properly registered to TWF or Z-One LLC, as both of these entities have made conflicting
demands for registration of the shares of common stock. On February 5, 2024, the Company filed a motion for entry of default against
TWF, seeking an order directing the Company to register the shares of common stock in the name of Z-One and that the Company be released
from all associated liability and claims. The Court denied the motion without prejudice and will reconsider the motion without further
briefing upon the filing of a supplemental party affidavit. On May 9, 2024, Z-One filed a motion for summary judgement seeking dismissal
of the action, representing that Z-One and TWF have settled their dispute over the entitlement to the Company s shares of common
stock and there is no remaining dispute before the Court. On May 21, 2024, the Company filed a supplemental affidavit in support of
its motion for entry of default. The Court has set a hearing on Z-One s motion for November 14, 2024. The Company believes that
any claims related to the Notes are without merit and will continue to defend vigorously against these claims.

Overview 

We
are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel immuno-oncology products based
on our proprietary Tri-specific Killer Engager (TriKE ), and Tetra-specific Killer Engager (Dual Targeting TriKE fusion protein immune cell engager technology platforms. Our TriKE and Dual Targeting TriKE platforms generates
proprietary therapeutics designed to harness and enhance the cancer killing abilities of a patient s own natural killer cells,
or NK cells. Once bound to an NK cell, our moieties are designed to enhance the NK cell, and precisely direct it to one or more specifically
targeted proteins expressed on a specific type of cancer cell or virus infected cell, resulting in the targeted cell s death. TriKE s
can be designed to target any number of tumor antigens on hematologic malignancies or solid tumors and do not require patient-specific
customization. 

We
are using our TriKE platform with the intent to bring to market immuno-oncology products that can treat a range of hematologic
malignancies, solid tumors, and potentially autoimmune disorders. The platform is scalable, and we are putting processes in place to
be able to produce investigational new drug (IND) ready moieties in a timely manner after a specific TriKE conceptual
design. Specific drug candidates can then be advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with partnering
companies. We believe our TriKE s may have the ability, if approved for marketing, to be used as both monotherapy and in combination
with other standard-of-care therapies. 

Our
initial work was conducted in collaboration with the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota under a program led by Dr.
Jeffrey Miller, Professor of Medicine, and the Deputy Director at the Center. Dr. Miller is a recognized key opinion leader in the field
of NK cell and IL-15 biology and their therapeutic potential. We have exclusive rights to the TriKE platform and are
generating additional intellectual property for specific moieties. 

20 

Our
product pipeline as of September 30, 2024 is presented below: 

GTB-3550 

GTB-3550
was our first TriKE product candidate. It reflected our first-generation TriKE platform. It is a single-chain,
tri-specific scFv recombinant fusion protein conjugate composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD16 and
anti-CD33 antibodies and a modified form of IL-15. We studied this anti-CD16-IL-15-anti-CD33 TriKE in CD33 positive leukemias,
a marker expressed on tumor cells in acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, and myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. CD33 is primarily a myeloid
differentiation antigen with endocytic properties broadly expressed on AML blasts and, possibly, some leukemic stem cells. CD33 or Siglec-3
(sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 3, SIGLEC3, SIGLEC3, gp67, p67) is a transmembrane receptor expressed on cells of myeloid lineage.
It is usually considered myeloid-specific, but it can also be found on some lymphoid cells. The anti-CD33 antibody fragment used for
these studies was derived from the M195 humanized anti-CD33 scFv and has been used in multiple human clinical studies. It has been exploited
as a target for therapeutic antibodies for many years. We believe the approval of the antibody-drug conjugate gemtuzumab validates this
targeted approach. 

GTB-3550
was replaced by a more potent next-generation camelid nanobody TriKE , GTB-3650, both targeting CD33 on relapsed/refractory
AML and high-risk MDS. The pivot from GTB-3550 to GTB-3650 in our clinical development was based on a solid preclinical foundation that
showed markedly enhanced potency of the camelid modification of the first-generation TriKE . This is illustrated below
by better tumor control of AML bearing animals with GTB-3650 (purple dots) compared to GTB-3550 (blue dots). This provided the rationale
for pausing further development of GTB-3550 and moving over to solely develop the second-generation TriKE platform. 

21 

Second
Generation TriKE s Utilize Camelid Nanobody Technology 

Our
goal is to be a leader in immuno-oncology therapies targeting a broad range of indications including hematological malignancies and solid
tumors. A key element of our strategy includes introducing a next-generation camelid nanobody platform. Camelid antibodies (often referred
as nanobodies) are smaller than human immunoglobulin and consist of two heavy chains. These nanobodies have the potential to have greater
affinity to target antigens, potentially resulting in greater potency. We are utilizing this camelid antibody structure for all of our
new TriKE product candidates. 

22 

To
develop second generation TriKE s, we designed a new humanized CD16 engager derived from a single-domain antibody. While
scFvs consist of a heavy and a light variable chain joined by a linker, single-domain antibodies consist of a single variable heavy chain
capable of engaging without the need of a light chain counterpart (see figure below). 

These
single-domain antibodies are thought to have certain attractive features for antibody engineering, including physical stability, ability
to bind deep grooves, and increased production yields, amongst others. Pre-clinical studies demonstrated increased NK cell activation
against CD33+ targets including enhanced NK cell degranulation CD107a+) and IFNg with the single-domain CD16 TriKE 
(cam 16-wt15-33; GTB-3650) compared to the original TriKE (scFv16-m 15-33; GTB-3550) (see figure below). This data was
published by Dr. Felices M et al (2020) in Cancer Immunol Res. 

CD33+
HL60 Targets in Killing Assays 

The
purple line represents the GTB-3650 and the blue line represents GTB-3550. 

GTB-3650 

GTB-3650
is a CD33 targeted TriKE which targets CD33 on the surface of myeloid leukemias and an agonistic camelid engager to the potent activating
receptor on NK cells, CD16. Use of this engager enhances the activity of wild type IL-15 included in GTB-3650, no longer needing the
mutant IL-15 included in GTB-3550. The TriKE approach provides a novel way to specifically target these tumors by leveraging NK
cells, which have been shown to mediate relapse protection in this setting, in an anti-CD33-targeted fashion. We are moving GTB-3650
clinically based on pre-clinical data showing a marked increase in potency compared to GTB-3550, which we anticipate could lead to an
enhanced efficacy signal in AML and MDS. We have advanced GTB-3650 through preclinical studies and filed an Investigational New Drug
(IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2023. In late June 2024, we received clearance from the
FDA with respect to our IND Application in relation to GTB 3650. We further anticipate approval to start study enrollment targeting patients
with relapsed/refractory AML and high grade MDS in the second half of 2024. This initial study will test GTB-3650 as monotherapy testing
administration 2 weeks on and two weeks off (to prevent NK cell exhaustion) for at least 2 cycles of therapy. The design of the trial
has been agreed on with the FDA. 

23 

GTB-5550 

GTB-5550
is a B7-H3 targeted TriKE which targets B7-H3 on the surface of advanced solid tumors (figure above). B7-H3 is an exciting target
as it displays specific expression on a broad spectrum of solid tumor malignancies, allowing our team to target these malignancies through
GTB-5550. Pre-clinical work has shown that this molecule has NK-cell targeted activity against a variety of solid tumor settings, including
head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (figure below), prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, and lung cancer
(amongst others). We are advancing GTB-5550 through preclinical studies and initiated a GMP manufacturing campaign in anticipation of
filing an IND in the first half of 2025. A pre-IND packet was submitted to the FDA in October 2023 with a written response from the FDA
in December 2023. The main question from the FDA was regarding pre-clinical toxicology and a pivot to subcutaneous dosing. The initial
trial expected in 2025 is designed as a basket trial for patients with B7-H3+ solid tumors using Monday through Friday dosing (2 weeks
on and 2 weeks off to prevent immune exhaustion), and is dependent on manufacturing of clinical materials. 

GTB-7550 

GTB-7550
TriKE is a product candidate in development for the treatment of lupus and other autoimmune disorders. GTB-7550 TriKE is a
tri-specific molecule composed of a camelid nanobody that binds the CD16 receptor on NK cells, a scFv engager against CD19 on malignant
and normal B cells, and a human IL-15 sequence between them. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. When making these estimates and assumptions, we consider our historical
experience, our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ under different estimates and assumptions. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section
are those that we consider to be the most critical to gain an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve
significant judgments and uncertainties. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include accruals for potential liabilities,
assumptions used in deriving the fair value of warrant liabilities, valuation of equity instruments issued for services, and valuation
of deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

24 

Warrant
Liability 

We
evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives
in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . For derivative financial instruments that are accounted
for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with
changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. 

Our
use of derivative financial instruments is generally limited to warrants issued by us that do not meet the criteria for equity treatment
and are recorded as liabilities. We do not use financial instruments or derivatives for any trading purposes. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
periodically issue stock-based compensation to officers, directors, employees, and consultants for services rendered. Such issuances
vest and expire according to terms established at the issuance date. 

Stock-based
payments made to officers, directors, employees, and consultants in exchange for goods and services, including grants of employee stock
options, are recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock
Compensation . Stock based payments to officers, directors, employees, and consultants, which are generally time vested, are measured
at the grant date fair value and depending on the conditions associated with the vesting of the award, compensation cost is recognized
on a straight-line or graded basis over the vesting period. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period
and manner as if we had paid cash for the services. The fair value of stock options granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life, and future dividends.
The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses decreased by 57,000 and approximately 1.2 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in project materials costs, partially offset by an increase in scientific research
costs. 

Research
and development expenses relate to our continued development and production of our most advanced TriKE product candidates GTB-3650
and GTB-5550 along with the progression on other promising candidates. In late June 2024, we received clearance from the FDA with respect
to our IND Application in relation to GTB 3650. We anticipate our direct clinical and preclinical expenses to increase in
the second half of 2024 as we plan to advance our next generation GTB-3650 camelid nanobody product into the clinic, enroll patients,
and perform tests for data collection. We also plan to complete the product development of GTB-5550 and anticipate submission of IND
application for GTB-5550 in the first half of 2025. We do not, however, anticipate an increase in related R D licensing and administrative
costs.

Selling,
General, and Administrative Expenses 

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses increased by approximately 1.1 million and 3.0 million, for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to an increase in legal and professional fees and an accrual for the probable settlement of a legal matter where the amount of the settlement can be reasonably
estimated.

Interest
Income 

Interest
income decreased by 120,000 and 257,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods,
respectively, primarily due to lower short term investment balances. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense decreased by 213,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period, respectively, due
to the financing costs incurred associated with warrants accounted as warrant liability, there were no similar transactions during the
current period. 

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 

The
change in fair value of warrant liability decreased by approximately 390,000 and 3.9 million for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods, respectively, resulting from a reduction in our warrant liability due to
the decline in the Company s stock price at September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior comparable periods. 

Gain
on Extinguishment of Debt 

Gain
on extinguishment of debt decreased by 547,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period, respectively,
and resulted from share settlements of a greater amount of vendor accounts payable than the fair value of the shares on the date of settlement,
there were no similar transactions during the current period.

Liquidity
and Going Concern Analysis 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.
We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from our product sales. We have sustained
operating losses since inception, and we expect such losses to continue into the foreseeable future. Historically, we have financed our
operations through public and private sales of common stock, issuance of preferred and common stock, issuance of convertible debt instruments,
and strategic collaborations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net loss of approximately 9.4 million and
used cash in operations of approximately 10.4 million. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue
as a going concern. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes
we will continue as a going concern, and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments
in the ordinary course of business. 

We
have evaluated the significance of the uncertainty regarding our financial condition in relation to our ability to meet our obligations,
which has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. While it is very difficult to estimate our future
liquidity requirements we believe if we are unable to obtain additional financing, existing cash resources will not be sufficient to
enable us to fund the anticipated level of operations through one year from the date the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements are issued. There can be no assurances that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms.
In the event that we do not secure additional financing, we will be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate some or all of our discretionary
spending, which could adversely affect our business prospects, ability to meet long-term liquidity needs and the ability to continue
operations.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Our
Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company, as defined in 17 C.F.R. 229.10(f)(1) and is not required to provide information
for this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the United States Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended), as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting
is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by,
or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal accounting officers and effected by a company s
board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and
procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance
 with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors;
 and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Inherent
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 

28 

These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a
simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

No
changes in our internal controls over financial reporting were made during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

Ohri
Matter 

On
July 22, 2024, the Company filed an AAA Arbitration Demand against Manu Ohri, its former Chief Financial Officer. In the Demand, the
Company asserts claims against Mr. Ohri for breach of his fiduciary duties and breach of contract and seeks a declaratory judgment providing
that the Company may characterize Mr. Ohri s termination as for cause under his Employment Agreement, and that the
Company may revoke the Separation Agreement entered into between the Company and Mr. Ohri prior to the Company learning of Mr. Ohri s
breaches. In addition to the declaratory judgment, the Company seeks damages arising from Mr. Ohri s violations, and attorneys 
fees and any forum and arbitration fees. On September 3, 2024, Mr. Ohri filed both a general denial of the Company s claims against
him and counterclaims for breach of his Employment Agreement and Separation Agreement. At this early stage in the proceedings the Company
is not able to determine the probability of the outcome of this matter or a range of reasonably expected losses, if any. 

Berk
Matter 

On
November 14, 2023, former interim Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Gregory Berk filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Massachusetts alleging that the Company discriminated and retaliated against Dr. Berk for engaging in protected
whistleblowing activity in violation of the Sarbanes Oxley Act SOX ). The Company vigorously defended this matter and believes it to be without merit; however, the parties have agreed
to resolve the matter and the Company expects the lawsuit to be dismissed shortly. The Company believes it has recorded appropriate accruals
for the matter. 

TWF
Global Matter 

On
May 24, 2023, TWF Global, LLC TWF filed a Complaint in the California Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles naming
the Company as defendant. The Complaint alleges that TWF is the holder of two Convertible Promissory Notes Notes and
that the Company did not deliver shares of common stock due on conversion in February 2021. TWF was seeking per diem liquidated damages
based on the terms of alleged Notes. On July 14, 2023, the Company filed a motion to dismiss for improper forum because the terms of
the Notes, as alleged, require disputes to be filed in New York state and federal courts. TWF voluntarily dismissed its Complaint before
the California Superior Court of Los Angeles without prejudice. The Company subsequently filed a Summons and Complaint for Interpleader
against TWF and Z-One LLC before the Supreme Court of the State of New York County of New York, asking the Supreme Court to determine
if the Company s shares of common stock are properly registered to TWF or Z-One LLC, as both of these entities have made conflicting
demands for registration of the shares of common stock. On February 5, 2024, the Company filed a motion for entry of default against
TWF, seeking an order directing the Company to register the shares of common stock in the name of Z-One and that the Company be released
from all associated liability and claims. The Court denied the motion without prejudice and will reconsider the motion without further
briefing upon the filing of a supplemental party affidavit. On May 9, 2024, Z-One filed a motion for summary judgement seeking dismissal
of the action, representing that Z-One and TWF have settled their dispute over the entitlement to the Company s shares of common
stock and there is no remaining dispute before the Court. On May 21, 2024, the Company filed a supplemental affidavit in support of its
motion for entry of default. The Court has set a hearing on Z-One s motion for November 14, 2024. The Company believes that any
claims related to the Notes are without merit and will continue to defend vigorously against these claims.
