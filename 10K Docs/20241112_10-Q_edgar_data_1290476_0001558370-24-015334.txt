Under the SBHC Policy Statement, qualifying bank holding companies, such as the Company, have additional flexibility in the amount of debt they can issue and are also exempt from the Basel III capital framework as outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the "Basel III Capital Rules"). The SBHC Policy Statement does not apply to the Bank and the Bank must comply with the Basel III Capital Rules. The Bank is required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). The FDIC has adopted rules to implement the Basel III Capital Rules. The Basel III Capital Rules establish minimum capital ratios and risk weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by community banks, including applying higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans. The Basel III Capital Rules require banks to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (1) a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least , plus a capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least ); (2) a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least , plus the capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of ); (3) a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least , plus the capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of ); and (4) a leverage ratio of , calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking organizations with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded the minimum ratios under the Basel III Capital Rules. The Bank must also comply with the capital requirements set forth in the prompt corrective action regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950. To be well capitalized under these regulations, a bank must have the following minimum capital ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least ; (2) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least ; (3) a total

The Company s portfolio of LHFS is classified as Level 2. Interest Rate Lock Commitments and Forward Sales Commitments. The Company, through the Bank s mortgage banking subsidiary, enters into commitments to originate residential mortgage loans in which the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding, termed interest rate lock commitments. Such rate lock commitments on mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market are considered to be derivatives. Upon entering into a commitment to originate a loan, the Company protects itself from changes in interest rates during the period prior to sale by requiring a firm purchase agreement from a permanent investor before a loan can be closed (forward sales commitment). The Company locks in the loan and rate with an investor and commits to deliver the loan if settlement occurs on a best efforts basis, thus limiting interest rate risk. Certain additional risks exist if the investor fails to meet its purchase obligation; however, based on historical performance and the size and nature of the investors the Company does not expect them to fail to meet their obligation. The Company determines the fair value of IRLCs based on the price of the underlying loans obtained from an investor for loans that will be delivered on a best efforts basis while taking into consideration the probability that the rate lock commitments will close. The fair value of these derivative instruments is reported in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024, and totaled , with a notional amount of million and total positions of , and was reported in Other Assets at December 31, 2023, and totaled with a notional amount of million and total positions of . Changes in fair value are recorded as a component of mortgage banking income, net in the Consolidated Income Statement for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company s IRLCs are classified as Level 2. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, each IRLC and all LHFS were subject to a forward sales commitment on a best efforts basis. The Company uses fair value accounting for its forward sales commitments related to IRLCs and LHFS under ASC 825-10-15-4(b). The fair value of forward sales commitments is reported in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024, and totaled with a notional amount of million and total positions of and was reported in Other Liabilities at December 31, 2023, and totaled , with a notional amount of million and total positions of .

Agreement and Plan of Merger On September 23, 2024, the Company, the Bank and TowneBank entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Agreement ), which provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, the Company and the Bank will merge with and into TowneBank (the Merger ), with TowneBank being the surviving corporation in the Merger. Under the terms of the Agreement, shareholders of the Company will receive 80.25 per share in cash for each share of the Company s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger. The Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are subject to the approval of the shareholders of the Company, approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ), approval of the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and other customary closing conditions. The Company and TowneBank anticipate closing the Merger in the first quarter of 2025. General The Company s primary source of earnings is net interest income, and its principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company is not able to predict market interest rate fluctuations and its asset/liability management strategy may not prevent interest rate changes from having a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial condition. Although we endeavor to minimize the credit risk inherent in the Company s loan portfolio, we must necessarily make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio based on our experience and evaluation of economic conditions. If such assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect, the current allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover loan losses and additions to the allowance may be necessary, which would have a negative impact on net income. Results of operations The following presents management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition of the Company at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the results of operations for the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Summary For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net income of 2.11 million, or 1.41 per fully diluted share, compared to a net loss of 2.55 million, or (1.72) per fully diluted share, for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net income of 5.53 million, or 3.70 per fully diluted share, compared to net income of 226,000, or 0.15 per fully diluted share, for the same period in 2023.

 On January 1, 2023, the Commercial Banking Segment adopted the Current Expected Credit Loss CECL methodology for estimating credit losses, which resulted in an increase of 150,000 in the allowance for credit losses on January 1, 2023 to 3.52 million. The allowance for credit losses included an allowance for credit losses on loans of 3.24 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of 277,000. As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was 4.03 million and included an allowance for credit losses on loans of 3.70 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of 328,000. Net interest income Net interest income, which represents the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, is the Company s primary source of earnings. Net interest income can be affected by changes in market interest rates as well as the level and composition of assets, liabilities and shareholders equity. Net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The net yield on interest-earning assets net interest margin or NIM is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Generally, the net interest margin will exceed the net interest spread because a portion of interest earning assets are funded by various noninterest-bearing sources, principally noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders equity. 

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (dollars in thousands) Average interest-earning assets 712,403 700,657 11,746 Interest income 10,336 8,462 1,874 Yield on interest-earning assets 5.77 4.79 0.98 Average interest-bearing liabilities 437,547 430,433 7,114 Interest expense 3,265 2,348 917 Cost of interest-bearing liabilities 2.97 2.16 0.81 Net interest income 7,071 6,114 957 Net interest margin 3.95 3.46 0.49 The following are variances of note for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023: NIM expanded by 49 basis points to 3.95 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.46 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The expansion was driven by the following:
 
 o The yield on our earning assets increased by 98 basis point to 5.77 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.79 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our yield on earning assets continues to be a result of improvement in our earning asset mix as well as the impact of the rise in interest rates during 2023 and 2024. We expect to see continued improvement in the yield on earning assets because of higher yielding loan growth combined with the amortization of lower yielding assets. o The increased yield on earnings assets was partially offset by the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increasing by 81 basis points to 2.97 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our cost of interest bearing liabilities has been driven by an increase in the rate paid on variable rate debt and market pressures on deposit rates. The rate paid on money market deposit accounts increased 108 basis points to 3.30 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.22 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the rate paid on time deposits increased 142 basis points to 3.55 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.13 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the rate on time deposits was impacted heavily by the addition of 20.0 million in brokered time deposits at a weighted average rate of 4.89 during the three months ended March 31, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, 5.0 million in brokered time deposits at a weighted average rate of 4.98 matured and were not replaced due to core deposit growth during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 o While the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by 81 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, overall cost of funds increased by 55 basis points, 1.92 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The lower increase in cost of funds was driven by our strong non-interest bearing deposits level, which remains near 38 of our deposit base.

The expansion was driven by the following: o The yield on our earning assets increased by 94 basis points, 5.60 as of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.66 as of the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our yield on earning assets continues to be a result of improvement in our earning asset mix as well as the impact of the rise in interest rates during 2023 and 2024. We expect to see continued improvement in the yield on earning assets because of higher yielding loan growth combined with the amortization of lower yielding assets. o The increased yield on earning assets was partially offset by the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increasing by 113 basis points to 2.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.76 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our cost of funds was driven by an increase in the rate paid on variable rate debt and market pressures on deposit rates. The rate paid on money market deposit accounts increased 118 basis points to 2.88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.70 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and the rate paid on time deposits increased 272 basis points to 4.25 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.53 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the rate on time deposits was impacted heavily by the addition of 20.0 million in brokered time deposits at a weighted average rate of 4.89 during the three months ended March 31, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 5.0 million in brokered time deposits at a weighted average rate of 4.98 matured and were not replaced due to core deposit growth during the three months ended September 30, 2024. While we expect there will be continued pressure on our funding base, we continue to see the velocity of those increases slowing down as of September 30, 2024. o While the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by 113 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, overall cost of funds increased by 77 basis points, 1.88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. 1.11 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The lower increase in cost of funds was driven by our strong non-interest bearing deposits level, which remained near 38 of our deposit base.

The Company recorded a provision for credit losses for loans of 128,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was the result of loan growth supported by stable macroeconomic conditions and credit quality remaining strong. Non-performing loans as a percentage of loans were consistent, 0.06 at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.05 at December 31, 2023. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments of 21,800 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was driven by an increase in the total commitments outstanding at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was 3.68 million and included an allowance for credit losses on loans of 3.35 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of 329,000. The Company recorded a recovery for credit losses for loans of 52,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was the result of loan growth being offset by improved credit metrics as non-performing loans as a percentage of loans decreased from 0.13 at December 31, 2022 to 0.06 at September 30, 2023 and the impact of 162,000 in net-recoveries for the period. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments of 52,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was driven by an increase in the total balance outstanding at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans ratio at the Company is 0.60 as of September 30, 2024 compared to the peer average of 1.12 . Management considers this level of allowance, when compared to peers, sufficient and appropriate based on the current asset quality metrics of the Company compared to peers and the overall assessment of the Company s loan portfolio. We believe our current level of allowance for credit losses is sufficient given current economic conditions and projections for unemployment.

 Income taxes The Company s effective tax rate, income tax as a percent of pre-tax income, may vary significantly from the statutory rate due to permanent differences and available tax credits. Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 508,000 and 1,366,000, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.4 and 19.8 , respectively, compared to income tax benefit of 754,000 and 155,000, respectively, or 22.8 and 218.2 , respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily related to a decrease in the tax credit received related to state taxes attributed to the Company and the Mortgage Banking Segment as well as the impact of the level of permanent difference related to the cash surrender value on bank owned life insurance remaining similar with significant change in pre-tax income. The Bank is not subject to Virginia income taxes, and instead is subject to a franchise tax based on bank capital.

 Balance Sheet Analysis Investment securities At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of our investment securities were classified as available for sale. For more financial data and other information about investment securities refer to Note 4 Investment Securities Available for Sale in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Loans The Company maintains rigorous underwriting standards coupled with regular evaluation of the creditworthiness of and the designation of lending limits for each borrower. The portfolio strategies include seeking industry, loan type and loan size diversification in order to minimize credit concentration risk. Management also focuses on originating loans in markets with which the Company is familiar. Additionally, as a significant amount of the loan losses we have experienced in the past is attributable to construction and land development loans, our strategy has shifted from reducing this type of lending to closely managing the quality and concentration in these loan types. As of September 30, 2024 approximately 81.0 of all loans are secured by mortgages on real property located principally in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Approximately 2.2 of the loan portfolio consists of rehabilitated student loans purchased by the Bank from 2014 to 2017 (see discussion following). The Company s commercial and industrial loan portfolio represents approximately 16.1 of all loans. Loans in this category are typically made to individuals and small and medium-sized businesses, and range between 250,000 and 2.5 million. Based on underwriting standards, commercial and industrial loans may be secured in whole or in part by collateral such as liquid assets, accounts receivable, equipment, inventory, and real property. The collateral securing any loan may depend on the type of loan and may vary in value based on market conditions. The remainder of our loan portfolio is in consumer loans which represent less than 1 of the total. Loans classified by type as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows (dollars in thousands):

Nonperforming assets, consisting solely of nonaccrual loans, totaled 369,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to 291,000 at December 31, 2023.

Until a nonperforming restructured loan has performed in accordance with its restructured terms for a minimum of three months, it will remain on nonaccrual status. Interest is accrued on outstanding loan principal balances, unless the Company considers collection to be doubtful. Commercial and unsecured consumer loans are designated as non-accrual when the Company considers collection of expected principal and interest doubtful. Mortgage loans and most other types of consumer loans past due 90 days or more may remain on accrual status if management determines that concern over our ability to collect principal and interest is not significant. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed against interest income in the current period and interest is subsequently recognized

 only to the extent cash is received. Interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest. There was 79,000 in loans with an individual allowance of 15,000 that were collateral dependent associated with the total nonaccrual loans of 369,000 at September 30, 2024. There were no individual allowances associated with the total nonaccrual loans of 291,000 at December 31, 2023, that were considered individually evaluated. Cumulative interest income that would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans been performing would have been approximately 92,000 and 83,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Student loans totaling 1.20 million and 2.23 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were past due 90 days or more and interest was still being accrued as principal and interest on such loans have a 98 guarantee by the DOE. The 2 not covered by the DOE guarantee is provided for in the allowance for credit losses. Deposits Deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount Amount Demand accounts 246,838 38.2 247,624 40.9 Interest checking accounts 69,763 10.8 76,289 12.6 Money market accounts 236,135 36.6 195,249 32.3 Savings accounts 31,626 4.9 39,633 6.5 Time deposits of 250,000 and over 25,485 3.9 9,145 1.5 Other time deposits 36,353 5.6 37,405 6.2 Total 646,200 100.0 605,345 100.0 Total deposits increased by 40,855,000, or 6.75 , from December 31, 2023. Variances of note are as follows: Noninterest bearing demand account balances decreased 786,000, or 0.32 , from December 31, 2023 and represented 38.2 of total deposits compared to 40.9 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in noninterest bearing demand deposits was driven by a combination of consumers and businesses drawing down balances due to higher costs associated with continued pressure from inflation.
 Low cost relationship deposits (i.e. interest checking, money market, and savings) balances increased 26,353,000, or 8.47 , from December 31, 2023. The increase in low-cost relationship deposits from the prior periods was the result of seasonal relationship growth as well as some deposits moving from non-interest bearing to interest bearing.
 Time deposits increased by 15,288,000, or 32.8 , from December 31, 2023. The increase was the result of the Commercial Bank Segment issuing 20.0 million in brokered time deposits, at a weighted average rate of 4.89 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to supplement the noninterest-bearing reduction. As of September 30, 2024, 5.0 million in brokered time deposits have matured and were not replaced as a result of core deposit growth.

Our ability to attract and retain deposits, and our cost of funds, has been, and is expected to continue to be, significantly affected by market conditions. Borrowings We utilize borrowings to supplement deposits to address funding or liability duration needs. For more financial data and other information about borrowings refer to Note 7 Borrowings in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Capital resources Shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 was 74,199,000 compared to 67,556,000 at December 31, 2023. The 6,643,000 increase in shareholders equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due primarily to the recognition of net income of 5,531,000 and by the 1,574,000 decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss offset by the dividend payouts of 807,000.

Liquidity Liquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss, and the ability to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves monitoring our sources and uses of funds in order to meet our day-to-day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits. Liquidity management is made more complicated because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control. For example, the timing of maturities of our investment portfolio is fairly predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made. However, net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to the same degree of control. At September 30, 2024, our liquid assets, consisting of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale, totaled 109,366,000, or 14.4 of total assets. Investment securities traditionally provide a secondary source of liquidity since they can be converted into cash in a timely manner. At September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 249.4 million in uninsured deposits, which represents 38.70 of total deposits. Total liquidity sources at September 30, 2024 equal 214.60 million, or 86.05 of uninsured deposits. The Company s internal policy limits wholesale deposits (i.e., brokered deposits and internet listing services) to 20 percent of total funding, representing 151.2 million of additional availability as of September 30, 2024. The Company had 15.3 million in wholesale deposits as of September 30, 2024, which were brokered deposits with a weighted average rate of 4.89 . Our holdings of liquid assets plus the ability to maintain and expand our deposit base and borrowing capabilities serve as our principal sources of liquidity. We plan to meet our future cash needs through the liquidation of temporary investments, the generation of deposits,

 and from additional borrowings. In addition, we will receive cash upon the maturity and sale of loans and the maturity of investment securities. We maintain three federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks totaling 22.8 million for which there were no borrowings against the lines at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We are also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, from which applications for borrowings can be made. The FHLB requires that securities, qualifying mortgage loans, and stock of the FHLB owned by the Bank be pledged to secure any advances from the FHLB. The unused borrowing capacity currently available from the FHLB at September 30, 2024 was 22.6 million, based on the Bank's qualifying collateral available to secure any future borrowings. However, we are able to pledge additional collateral to the FHLB in order to increase our available borrowing capacity up to 25 of assets, which would result in a total remaining credit availability of 166.4 million as of September 30, 2024. Liquidity provides us with the ability to meet normal deposit withdrawals, while also providing for the credit needs of customers. We are committed to maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors, provide for reasonable growth, and fully comply with all regulatory requirements. At September 30, 2024, we had commitments to originate 159,311,000 of loans. Fixed commitments to incur capital expenditures were less than 100,000 at September 30, 2024. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in the 12-month period ending September 30, 2025 totaled 56,528,000. We believe that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We further believe that deposit growth, loan repayments and other sources of funds will be adequate to meet our foreseeable short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Interest rate sensitivity An important element of asset/liability management is the monitoring of our sensitivity to interest rate movements. In order to measure the effects of interest rates on our net interest income, management takes into consideration the expected cash flows from the securities and loan portfolios and the expected magnitude of the repricing of specific asset and liability categories. We evaluate interest sensitivity risk and then formulate guidelines to manage this risk based on management s outlook regarding the economy, forecasted interest rate movements and other business factors. Our goal is to maximize and stabilize the net interest margin by limiting exposure to interest rate changes. Contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual term of our loan portfolio. The average lives of mortgage loans are substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and because of enforcement of due-on-sale clauses, which gives us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. In addition, certain borrowers increase their equity in the security property by making payments in excess of those required under the terms of the mortgage. The sale of fixed rate loans is intended to protect us from precipitous changes in the general level of interest rates. The valuation of adjustable rate mortgage loans is not as directly dependent on the level of interest rates as is the value of fixed rate loans. As with other investments, we regularly monitor the appropriateness of the level of adjustable rate mortgage loans in our portfolio and may decide from time to time to sell such loans and reinvest the proceeds in other adjustable rate investments.

 Impact of inflation and changing prices The Company s financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the Company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historical dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered. The primary effect of inflation on the operations of the Company is reflected in increased operating costs. In management s opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Company, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates The administrator of LIBOR announced that the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings would cease to be published or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, enacted in March 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR for contracts governed by U.S. law that have no or ineffective fallbacks. We have a number of borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. As a result of the announced discontinuation of LIBOR on June 30, 2023, the Company replaced the LIBOR leg of the calculated floating rate for these instruments with the corresponding term SOFR plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment as per the guidelines outlined within the final rulings under the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. This transition did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not Applicable. ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 in ensuring that all material information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed summarized and reported with the time periods specified in SEC rules and regulations and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of it that occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the course of its operations, the Company may become a party to legal proceedings. There are no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company is party or of which the property of the Company is subject. ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the following risk factors represent material updates and additions to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10- K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024. Additional risks not presently known, or that are currently deemed immaterial, may also adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. The Merger with TowneBank may distract management of the Company from its other responsibilities. The Merger could cause management of the Company to focus its time and energies on matters related to the Merger that otherwise would be directed to the Company s business and operations. Any such distraction on the part of management of the Company, if significant, could affect its ability to service existing business and develop new business and may adversely affect the business and earnings of the Company. Termination of the Agreement with TowneBank could negatively impact the Company. Each of the Company s and TowneBank s obligation to consummate the Merger remains subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled to consummate the Merger, and there can be no assurance that all of the conditions will be satisfied, or that the Merger will be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause the Company not to realize some or all of the benefits that the Company expects to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe. If the Agreement is terminated, the Company s business may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. Additionally, if the Agreement is terminated, the market price of the Company s common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. TowneBank and/or the Company may be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or to proceedings commenced against either company to perform obligations under the Agreement. If the Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including circumstances involving a change in recommendation by the Company s board of directors, the Company may be required to pay to TowneBank a termination fee of 4.8 million. In addition, the Company has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, the Company would have to recognize these expenses and would have committed substantial time and resources by management, without the Company s shareholders receiving cash proceeds from the Merger. In addition, failure to consummate the Merger also may result in negative reactions from the financial markets or from the Company s customers, vendors and employees. The Agreement with TowneBank limits the ability of the Company to pursue alternatives to the Merger. The Agreement contains customary no-shop provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, limit the ability of the Company to initiate, solicit, endorse, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of the Company. In addition, under certain circumstances, if the Agreement is terminated and the Company consummates a similar transaction with a party other than TowneBank, the Company must pay to TowneBank a fee of 4.8 million. These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing the acquisition even if it were prepared to pay consideration, with respect to the Company or its shareholders, with a higher per share market price than that proposed in the Merger.

 The Company will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending. Uncertainty about the effects of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties may impair the Company s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with the Company to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company. Retention of certain employees by the Company may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company or the combined company following the Merger. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the Company or the combined company following the Merger, the Company s business could be harmed. In addition, the Company has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to the closing of the Merger and from taking certain specified actions without the consent of TowneBank. These restrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated, or cannot be met. Before the Merger may be completed, various approvals, consents and non-objections must be obtained from bank regulatory authorities, including the FDIC. In determining whether to grant these approvals, the regulators consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party. T hese approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to an adverse development in either party s regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators in granting such approvals governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition or changes in legislation or the political environment generally. The approvals that are granted may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement or imposing additional material costs on the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the Merger. The completion of the Merger is conditioned on the receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals without the imposition of any materially burdensome regulatory condition and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods. Additionally, the completion of the Merger is conditioned on the absence of any order, decree or injunction by any court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that would enjoin or prohibit the completion of the Merger. If the consummation of the Merger is delayed, including by a delay in receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Shareholder litigation could prevent or delay the completion of the Merger or otherwise negatively impact the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Shareholders of the Company and/or TowneBank may file lawsuits against the Company, TowneBank and/or the directors and officers of either company in connection with the Merger. One of the conditions to the closing is that no order, decree or injunction by any court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that would enjoin or prohibit the completion of the Merger be in effect. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the Company or TowneBank from completing the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the Merger and could result in significant costs to the Company, including any cost associated with the indemnification of the Company s directors and officers. The Company may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the Merger. Shareholder lawsuits may divert management attention from management of the Company s business or operations. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations and could prevent or delay the completion of the Merger.

Exhibit 32.1 STATEMENT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C.
