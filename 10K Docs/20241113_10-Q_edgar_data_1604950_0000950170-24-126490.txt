 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Quarterly Report") contains express or implied forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about the commercialization of FUROSCIX, including the timing and progress thereof, the timing or likelihood of regulatory filings and approvals, the potential development of an autoinjector and related benefits and timing thereof, including as related to a sNDA application, the potential expansion of the FUROSCIX indication to include treatment of edema in patients with chronic kidney disease, our plans to develop and commercialize our product candidates, the timing of our ongoing or planned clinical trials, the clinical utility of our product candidates, expectations surrounding manufacturing capabilities and supply chain matters, our commercialization capabilities and strategy, the funds available under the Credit Agreement and Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement and the timing thereof, the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to remediate any material weakness, our future financial performance, the anticipated impact of general economic conditions on our business, and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, capital needs and capital expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, intends, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. 
 
 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they relate to future events or our future operational or financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things: 
 
 We are heavily dependent on the success of our product candidates and our approved product, FUROSCIX (furosemide injection). We have only one approved product and we cannot give any assurance that we will receive regulatory approval for any other product candidates, which is necessary before they can be commercialized. 

If we fail to produce FUROSCIX in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, we may face delays in our commercialization efforts. 

The commercial success of FUROSCIX and any other product candidates, if approved, depends upon attaining market acceptance by hospital networks, physicians, patients, third-party payers and the medical community. 

If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities or continue to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell FUROSCIX, we may be unable to generate substantial revenue. 

We have a limited operating history and no history of commercializing pharmaceutical products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for our future success. 

We have a history of significant operating losses and expect to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future; we may never achieve or maintain profitability. 

We may need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts. 

Our success depends on our ability to manufacture, or the ability of third parties to deliver, sufficient quantities of supplies, components and drug product for commercialization of FUROSCIX or any of our product candidates, if approved, including our ability to monitor quality control issues related to the production of FUROSCIX and on-body infusors in the volumes that will be required on a timely basis. 

Our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, as well as the ability of our collaborators to protect their intellectual property and proprietary technology. 

If we fail to comply with our obligations under our existing and any future intellectual property license with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business. 

We may be subject to product liability lawsuits related to our product candidates, if approved, which could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our products and product candidates. 

Our failure to successfully identify, develop and market additional product candidates could impair our ability to grow. 

i 

ii 

 We depend heavily on our executive officers, directors and principal consultants and the loss of their services would materially harm our business. 

Other risks and uncertainties, including those listed under the caption Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 13, 2024, as well as in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, then actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should therefore not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report.

 million. Management expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company has financed its operations to date from proceeds from the sale of common stock, preferred stock and the incurrence of debt. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of million. On October 13, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement and Guaranty (the "Oaktree Agreement") with, among others, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC, in its capacity as administrative agent for the lenders (Note 9). On August 9, 2024 (the "Closing Date"), the Company entered into a Credit Agreement and Guaranty (the "Credit Agreement") with the guarantors from time to time party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the "Lenders"), and Perceptive Credit Holdings IV, LP, in its capacity as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Agent") (Note 9). On the Closing Date, the Company also entered into a Revenue Participation Right Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement") with Perceptive Credit Holdings IV, LP (the "Purchaser") (Note 9). The Company used the proceeds of the Credit Agreement and the Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement to, on the Closing Date, prepay all outstanding obligations under the Oaktree Agreement, including the payment of fees and expenses associated with the Oaktree Agreement. In addition, on August 13, 2024, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock (and, in lieu of such shares of common stock to selected investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of its common stock) with net proceeds of million (Note 10).

The Company measures the term loan and the revenue purchase and sale liability from the Perceptive Financing at fair value based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which causes them to be classified as Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. These valuations use assumptions and estimates the Company believes would be made by a market participant in making the same valuation. The Company assesses these assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis as additional data impacting the assumptions and estimates are obtained. Changes in the fair value of the Perceptive Financing related to updated assumptions and estimates are recognized within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The fair value of the term loan was measured as of September 30, 2024, using a binomial lattice model to account for the dynamic nature of interest rate fluctuations and the strategic exercise of the certain optional prepayment features. Three variations of such binomial lattice models were utilized: the Black-Derman-Toy ("BDT"), Hull-White, and Ho-Lee models, each incorporating assumptions of future interest rate curves. The fair value of the revenue purchase and sale liability was measured as of September 30, 2024, using a hybrid methodology between the discounted cash flow ("DCF") and Monte Carlo simulation method MCS ), utilizing future cash flow projections and assumptions of the timing and probability of certain contingent events, such as the occurrence of a change of control and the exercise of call and put options. A discount rate of was used.

On the Closing Date, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement establishes a million term loan facility, consisting of (i) million funded on the Closing Date ("Tranche A Loan") and (ii) subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, million (together with the Tranche A Loan, collectively, the "Term Loan") that the Company may borrow in a single borrowing on or prior to March 31, 2026. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the one-month term SOFR (subject to a floor), plus an applicable margin of , payable in arrears. There will be scheduled repayments of outstanding principal on the Term Loan prior to (the Maturity Date ). The Company may voluntarily prepay the outstanding Term Loan, subject to a yield protection premium equal to (i) of the principal amount of the Term Loan prepaid, if prepaid on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii) of the principal amount of the Term Loan if prepaid after the first anniversary of the Closing Date through and including the second anniversary of the Closing Date, (iii) of the principal amount of the Term Loan if prepaid after the second anniversary of the Closing Date through and including the third anniversary of the Closing Date, with prepayment premium due after the third anniversary of the Closing date through the Maturity Date. On the Closing Date, the Company was required to issue to the Lenders of such Term Loan warrants to purchase of shares of the Company s common stock, in the aggregate (the Warrant ), at an exercise price of . Upon the completion of the sale of common stock on August 13, 2024 (Note 10), the exercise price of the warrants was adjusted to according to the terms of the agreement. Upon inception, the Company evaluated the warrants and determined that they met all the requirements for equity classification under ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815"). This transaction was accounted for as a detachable warrant at its fair value, using the residual method, and is recorded as an increase to additional paid-in-capital on the consolidated statement of stockholder s equity in the amount of million. The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the warrants. Assumptions included the fair market value per share of common stock on the valuation date of , the exercise price per warrant equal to , the expected volatility of , the risk-free interest

 , the contractual term of years and the absence of a dividend. The Warrant is immediately exercisable, and the exercise period will expire from the date of issuance. In addition to the Warrant, the Company will be required to issue to the Lenders warrants to purchase of shares of the Company's common stock (the "Tranche B Warrant") upon the draw down of the second tranche of the Term Loan on or prior to March 31, 2026. These warrants were accounted for using the residual method and were recorded on a relative fair value basis, resulting in an increase to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated statement of stockholder's equity in the amount of million. The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the warrants. Assumptions included the fair market value per share of common stock on the valuation date of , the exercise price per warrant equal to , the expected volatility of , the risk-free interest rate of , the contractual term of years and the absence of a dividend. The Tranche B Warrant will expire from the date of issuance. The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) will be guaranteed by any domestic subsidiaries of ours that become Guarantors (as defined in the Credit Agreement), subject to certain exceptions. The Borrowers and the Guarantors (collectively, the Loan Parties respective obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents are secured by first priority security interests in substantially all assets of the Loan Parties, subject to certain customary thresholds and exceptions. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants requiring the Company to (i) maintain certain levels of cash and cash equivalents in accounts subject to a control agreement in favor of the Agent of at least million at all times after the Closing Date and (ii) meet minimum quarterly net sales targets described in the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary events of default that entitle the Agent to cause the Company's indebtedness under the Credit Agreement to become immediately due and payable, and to exercise remedies against the Loan Parties and the collateral securing the Term Loan, including cash. Under the Credit Agreement, an event of default will occur if, among other things, the Company fails to make payments under the Credit Agreement (subject to specified periods), the Company or its subsidiaries breach any of the covenants under the Credit Agreement (subject to specified cure periods with respect to certain breaches), a material adverse change occurs, the Company, its subsidiaries or its respective assets become subject to certain legal proceedings, such as bankruptcy proceedings, the Company and/or its subsidiaries are unable to pay its debts as they become due or default on contracts with third parties which would permit the holder of indebtedness in excess of a certain threshold to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness or that could cause a material adverse change. Upon the occurrence and for the duration of an event of default, an additional default interest rate equal to per annum may apply to all obligations owed under the Credit Agreement. On the Closing Date, the Company also entered into the Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement with the Purchaser. Under the Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement, in exchange for the Purchaser's payment to the Company of a purchase price of up to million, in the aggregate, the Company has agreed to sell to the Purchaser its right to receive payment in full of a tiered single digit percentage of net sales of FUROSCIX. The initial sale of the Revenue Payment under the Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement in the amount of million took place on the Closing Date. The Purchaser s right to receive the Revenue Payment terminates and the Company no longer has the obligation to pay Purchaser Revenue Payments once the Purchaser receives (subject to reductions on September 30, 2027 and September 30, 2029 depending on the amount of Revenue Payments received by such dates) of the Purchase Price. The Company may also buy-out the Purchaser s rights to receive the Revenue Payments by paying Purchaser a tiered multiple on the Purchaser Price. The Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement contains various representations and warranties, including with respect to organization, authorization, and certain other matters, certain covenants with respect to payment, reporting, intellectual property, in-licenses, out-licenses, and certain other actions, indemnification obligations and other provisions customary for transactions of this nature. Certain conversion and redemption features of the Perceptive Financing would typically be considered derivatives that would require bifurcation. In lieu of bifurcating various features in the agreements, the Company has elected the fair value option for the Perceptive Financing and will record the changes in the fair value within the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations at the end of each reporting period. The initial fair value of the Term Loan and the Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement were million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , the fair value of the Term Loan and the Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement were million and million, respectively. Refer to Note 8 , Fair Value of Financial Instruments for additional details regarding the fair value measurement. In conjunction with the closing of the Perceptive Financing, the Company used a portion of the proceeds to prepay all outstanding loans under the Oaktree Agreement, including the exit fee, on the Closing Date.

On October 13, 2022 Oaktree Closing Date ), the Company entered into a Credit Agreement and Guaranty (the Oaktree Agreement with Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (collectively Oaktree to borrow up to million in three tranches with a maturity date of . The first tranche of million was drawn immediately. In connection with entering into the Oaktree Agreement, the Company granted warrants to Oaktree to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of per share. Upon inception, the Company evaluated the warrants and determined that they met all the requirements for equity classification under ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815"). This transaction was accounted for as a detachable warrant at its fair value, using the relative fair value method, which is based on a number of unobservable inputs and is recorded as an increase to additional paid-in-capital on the consolidated statement of stockholder s equity. The relative fair value of the warrants, million, was reflected as a discount to the term loan and was amortized using the effective interest method. The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the warrants. Assumptions included the fair market value per share of common stock on the valuation date of , the exercise price per warrant equal to , the expected volatility of , the risk-free interest rate of , the contractual term of years and the absence of a dividend. The warrants are immediately exercisable and the exercise period expires on October 13, 2029. The Company identified a number of embedded derivatives that required bifurcation from the term loan and that were separately accounted for in the consolidated financial statements as one compound derivative liability. Certain of these embedded features include contingent interest rate reset upon event of default, contingent put options, including change in control and going concern provisions, and additional costs as a result of changes in law. These embedded features met the criteria requiring these to be bifurcated because they were not clearly and closely related to the host instrument in accordance with ASC 815-15. The fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities associated with the term loan was estimated using a hybrid between the discounted cash flow and Monte Carlo simulation methods. This involved significant Level 3 inputs and assumptions including an estimated probability and timing of a change in control. The initial recognition of the embedded derivative liability upon issuance of the Term Loan was million. Prepayments of the term loan, in whole or in part, were subject to a prepayment fee. The Company was also required to pay an exit fee upon any payment or prepayment equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the loans funded under the Oaktree Agreement. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company paid off all unpaid borrowings under the Oaktree Agreement on August 9, 2024, including the million exit fee and a prepayment premium of million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the Company recorded and related to the amortization of the debt discount associated with the Oaktree Agreement, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the Company recorded million and million related to the amortization of the debt discount associated with the Oaktree Agreement, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the Company recorded and related to the amortization of the exit fee associated with the Oaktree Agreement, respectively.

 Item 2. 	 Management s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Quarterly Report and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 13, 2024. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many important factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section in our Annual Report and in this Quarterly Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products that have the potential to optimize the delivery of infused therapies, advance patient care and reduce healthcare costs. Our strategy is designed to enable the subcutaneous administration of therapies that have previously been limited to intravenous, or IV, delivery. By moving delivery away from the high-cost healthcare settings typically required for IV administration, we believe our technology has the potential to reduce overall healthcare costs and advance the quality and convenience of care. Our approved product, FUROSCIX, consists of our novel formulation of furosemide delivered via West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.'s, or West s, on-body infusor, which delivers an 80 mg/10 mL dose over 5 hours. On October 10, 2022, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved FUROSCIX for the treatment of congestion due to fluid overload in adults with New York Heart Association, or NYHA, Class II/III chronic heart failure. Subsequently, we announced the approval of our supplemental drug application expanding the FUROSCIX indication in heart failure on August 9, 2024 to include NYHA Class IV heart failure patients. FUROSCIX is the first and only FDA-approved subcutaneous loop diuretic that delivers IV equivalent diuresis at home. IV equivalence was established in a clinical study in which FUROSCIX demonstrated 99.6 bioavailability (90 CI: 94.8 -104.8 and 8-hour urine output of 2.7 L which was similar to subjects receiving intravenous furosemide. The commercial launch of FUROSCIX for congestion in patients with chronic heart failure commenced in the first quarter of 2023. 
 
 We are in the process of developing an 80mg/1mL autoinjector intended to provide an additional option to the on-body infusor for treatment of congestion due to fluid overload in eligible adult patients who do not require hospitalization. We believe that the development of an autoinjector, if successfully developed and approved, has the potential to significantly reduce manufacturing costs compared to the current on-body infusor and confer certain environmental advantages. We submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) in February 2024, initiated a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study in April of 2024, and completed enrollment in May 2024 with data received in August 2024. We are targeting to submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for the autoinjector in January 2025. 
 
 In early May of 2024 we submitted an sNDA seeking to expand the indication of FUROSCIX to include the treatment of edema due to fluid overload in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).The agency had previously confirmed that no additional clinical studies would be needed to expand the indication to CKD, provided that we can demonstrate an adequate PK/PD bridge to the listed drug, furosemide injection, 10mg/mL. The application was accepted for filing by the FDA in July 2024. The anticipated Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for our sNDA seeking label expansion in patients with CKD is March 6, 2025. 
 
 On October 7, 2024, the Company was notified that the FDA awarded 3-year exclusivity to FUROSCIX on the basis of clinical investigations conducted by the Company that were essential to approval. As a result, the FDA may not approve a subsequent product for subcutaneous administration of furosemide for 3 years from the date of approval of FUROSCIX, or October 7, 2025. 
 
 We estimate that there is a 12.5 billion total addressable market opportunity for FUROSCIX in the United States including both chronic heart failure and CKD. We believe FUROSCIX will allow eligible patients with chronic heart failure and, if approved, chronic kidney disease with worsening symptoms due to fluid overload despite oral diuretics, to receive IV-strength diuresis outside the high-cost hospital setting. At a price of approximately 947 per dose, we estimate the average cost of treatment with FUROSCIX for each episode to be approximately 4,735, which can be significantly lower than the cost of a single hospitalization for worsening heart failure. Prevention of heart failure hospital admissions and reduced readmission rates would result in reducing days patients spend in the hospital each year. By decreasing the number of heart failure admissions and readmissions to hospitals, we believe we can drive significant cost savings to payers and hospitals and improve patients quality of life through outpatient management of their fluid overload. In the quarter ended September 30, 2024 approximately 10,800 FUROSCIX doses were filled. 
 
 In June 2024, another U.S. patent was granted, further strengthening our coverage of concentrated formulations of furosemide. We have progressed our development on multiple formulations described in the patent properties, have identified potential product candidates, and commenced a clinical study with our lead formulation.

Perceptive Financing 
 
 On August 9, 2024 (the "Closing Date"), we entered into a Credit Agreement and Guaranty (the "Credit Agreement"), by and among us, the guarantors from time to time party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the "Lenders"), and Perceptive Credit Holdings IV, LP, in its capacity as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Agent"). The Credit Agreement establishes a 75.0 million term loan facility, consisting of (i) 50.0 million (the Tranche A Loan funded on the Closing Date, (ii) 25.0 million (the Tranche B Loan and, together with the Tranche A Loan, collectively, the Term Loan that the we may borrow in a single borrowing on or prior to March 31, 2026; provided, in the case of the Tranche B Loan, that we and our subsidiaries have obtained certain regulatory approval and achieved certain net sales targets, each as described in the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan has a maturity date of August 9, 2029 (the Maturity Date ). 
 
 Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the one-month term SOFR (subject to a 3.25 floor), plus an applicable margin of 6.75 , payable monthly in arrears. There will be no scheduled repayments of outstanding principal on the Term Loan prior to the Maturity Date. We may voluntarily prepay the outstanding Term Loan, subject to a yield protection premium equal to (i) 5.0 of the principal amount of the Term Loan prepaid, if prepaid on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii) 3.0 of the principal amount of the Term Loan if prepaid after the first anniversary of the Closing Date through and including the second anniversary of the Closing Date, (iii) 1.0 of the principal amount of the Term Loan if prepaid after the second anniversary of the Closing Date through and including the third anniversary of the Closing Date, with no prepayment premium due after the third anniversary of the Closing date through the Maturity Date. On the Closing Date, we were required to issue to the Lenders of such Term Loan warrants to purchase 300,000 of shares of our common stock, in the aggregate (the Warrant ), at an exercise price of 4.5902. The Warrant is immediately exercisable, and the exercise period will expire 6 years from the date of issuance. Upon the completion of the sale of common stock on August 13, 2024, the exercise price of the Warrants was adjusted to 4.00 according to the terms of the agreement. Please see Note 10. Stockholder's Equity to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information. 
 
 Our obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) will be guaranteed by any domestic subsidiaries of ours that become Guarantors (as defined in the Credit Agreement), subject to certain exceptions. The Borrowers and the Guarantors (collectively, the Loan Parties respective obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents are secured by first priority security interests in substantially all assets of the Loan Parties, subject to certain customary thresholds and exceptions. As of the Closing Date, there are no Guarantors. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants requiring us to (i) maintain certain levels of cash and cash equivalents in accounts subject to a control agreement in favor of the Agent of at least 5.0 million at all times after the Closing Date and (ii) meet minimum quarterly net sales targets described in the Credit Agreement. 
 
 In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary events of default that entitle the Agent to cause our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement to become immediately due and payable, and to exercise remedies against the Loan Parties and the collateral securing the Term Loan, including cash. Under the Credit Agreement, an event of default will occur if, among other things, we fail to make payments under the Credit Agreement (subject to specified periods), we or our subsidiaries breach any of the covenants under the Credit Agreement (subject to specified cure periods with respect to certain breaches), a material adverse change occurs, we, our subsidiaries or their respective assets become subject to certain legal proceedings, such as bankruptcy proceedings, we and/or our subsidiaries are unable to pay our debts as they become due or default on contracts with third parties which would permit the holder of indebtedness in excess of a certain threshold to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness or that could cause a material adverse change. Upon the occurrence and for the duration of an event of default, an additional default interest rate equal to 3.0 per annum may apply to all obligations owed under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 On the Closing Date, we entered into a revenue participation right purchase and sale agreement (the "Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement") with Perceptive Credit Holdings IV, LP (the "Purchaser"). Under the terms of the Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement, in exchange for the Purchaser s payment to us of a purchase price of 50.0 million, in the aggregate subject to certain conditions at closing (the Purchase Price ), we have agreed to sell to the Purchaser its right to receive payment in full of a tiered single digit percentage of net sales of FUROSCIX (the Revenue Payment for each calendar quarter commencing on the effective date of the Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement, subject to adjustments on June 30, 2028 and June 30, 2030 depending on the amount of Revenue Payments received by such dates. The Purchaser s right to receive the Revenue Payment terminates and we no longer have the obligation to pay Purchaser Revenue Payments once the Purchaser receives 200.0 (subject to reductions on September 30, 2027 and September 30, 2029 depending on the amount of Revenue Payments received by such dates) of the Purchase Price. We may also buy-out the Purchaser s rights to receive the Revenue Payments by paying Purchaser a tiered multiple on the Purchaser Price.

 The Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement contains various representations and warranties, including with respect to organization, authorization, and certain other matters, certain covenants with respect to payment, reporting, intellectual property, in-licenses, out-licenses, and certain other actions, indemnification obligations and other provisions customary for transactions of this nature. 
 2024 Public Offering 
 On August 12, 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement with Leerink Partners LLC and TD Securities (USA) LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule A thereto (collectively, the Underwriters ), relating to an underwritten offering of 12,000,000 shares (the Shares of our common stock, 0.0001 par value per share (the Common Stock ), and, in lieu of Common Stock to select investors, pre-funded warrants (the Pre-funded Warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of Common Stock. 
 
 The offering price of the Shares to the public was 4.00 per share, and the offering price of the Pre-funded Warrants to the public was 3.999 per underlying share, which was equal to the price per share of Common Stock being sold in the offering, minus 0.001, which is the exercise price per share of the Pre-funded Warrants. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, we also granted the Underwriters an option exercisable for 30 days to purchase up to an additional 1,875,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of 4.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. On August 12, 2024, the Underwriters exercised this option in full. The closing of the offering (including the sale of the Shares subject to the Underwriters option to purchase additional shares) took place on August 13, 2024. 
 
 The net proceeds from the offering were 53.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. We do not intend to list the Pre-funded Warrants on Nasdaq or any other nationally recognized securities exchange or trading system. 
 
 We have funded our operations from inception through September 30, 2024 primarily through the sale of shares of our common stock and incurrence of debt and, prior to that, through the private placement of our preferred stock. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 347.6 million and cash and cash equivalents of 91.5 million. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we support the commercialization efforts of FUROSCIX in the United States, including expanding our sales and marketing organization, continuing research and development efforts, engaging in scale-up manufacturing and seeking regulatory approval for new product candidates and enhancements. Our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other factors, the net sales of FUROSCIX, the scope and progress of our research and development efforts and timing of certain expenses. 
 COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Product Revenues 
 Product revenues, net, consist of net sales of FUROSCIX. We initiated shipments of FUROSCIX to customers in the United States, which include specialty pharmacies, in February 2023. We recognize revenue for product received by our customers net of allowances for customer discounts, service fees, estimated returns and rebates. 
 
 Cost of Product Revenues 
 Cost of product revenues include costs related to the manufacturing of FUROSCIX, including third party manufacturing costs, packaging and freight, in addition to royalty expenses. We began capitalizing inventory upon FDA approval of FUROSCIX. All costs related to inventory for FUROSCIX prior to FDA approval were expensed as incurred and therefore not included in cost of revenues. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development ("R D") expenses consist of the cost of engineering, clinical trials, regulatory and medical affairs and quality assurance associated with developing our proprietary technology and product candidates. R D expenses consist primarily of: 
 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel expense and stock-based compensation expense; 

cost of outside consultants who assist with technology development, regulatory affairs, clinical trials and medical affairs, and quality assurance; 

cost of clinical trial activities performed by third parties; 

cost of pre-approval pharmaceutical batch manufacturing; and 

25 

26 

 cost of facilities and supplies used for internal research and development and clinical activities. 

We expense R D costs as incurred. Given the emphasis to date on our approved product FUROSCIX, our R D expenses have not been allocated on a program-specific basis. In the future, we expect R D expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to develop new products and enhance existing products and technologies. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we: 
 continue to advance our pipeline programs beyond FUROSCIX; 

continue our current research and development activity; 

seek to identify additional research programs and additional product candidates; 

initiate preclinical testing and clinical trials for any product candidates we identify and develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and 

hire additional research, clinical and scientific personnel. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses consist of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel expense and stock-based compensation expense for personnel in executive, finance, commercial, field sales, human resources, facility operations and administrative functions. Other SG A expenses include promotional activities, marketing, conferences and trade shows, professional services fees, including legal, audit and tax fees, insurance costs, general corporate expenses and allocated facilities-related expenses. 
 We anticipate that our SG A expenses will increase as we continue to expand our corporate and commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization activities of FUROSCIX in the United States.

 Cost of product revenues. Cost of product revenues were 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Similar to product revenues, the increase of 2.2 million was due to an increase in demand of FUROSCIX further into commercial launch, and related manufacturing costs. 
 Research and development expenses. R D expenses were 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 0.1 million was primarily attributable to an increase of 0.2 million in clinical study costs. This was offset by a 0.1 million decrease in pharmaceutical development, quality, regulatory and employee-related costs. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG A expenses were 21.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 7.2 million was primarily attributable to 4.4 million in costs associated with entering into the Credit Agreement and Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement, and a 1.6 million increase in employee-related costs, a 0.8 million increase in commercial costs, a 0.3 million increase in patient support, and a 0.2 million increase in professional service costs. The increase was partially offset by a 0.1 million decrease in taxes and insurance. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was 13.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The loss was related to the payoff of the Oaktree Agreement (as defined below) in August 2024. 
 Change in fair value of term loan. The change in fair value the term loan, which is accounted for under the fair value option, was 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change in fair value was primarily due to changes in interest rates and volatility. 
 Change in fair value of revenue purchase and sale liability. The change in fair value of the revenue purchase and sale liability, which is accounted for under the fair value option, was 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change in fair value was primarily due to changes in market yields. 
 Other income (expense). Other income was 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expense of 36,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income of 1.8 million was primarily attributable to the fair value adjustment to the derivative liability and foreign exchange losses in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest income. Interest income was 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.4 million was primarily attributable to lower balances on our financial instruments. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense was 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.2 million was due to lower amortization of debt costs associated with the Oaktree Agreement.

 Interest income. Interest income was 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.5 million was primarily attributable to lower balances on our financial instruments.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Overview 
 We have funded our operations from inception through September 30, 2024 primarily through the sale of shares of our common stock, through the private placement of our preferred stock and the incurrence of debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had received net cash proceeds of 92.7 million from our initial public offering; 56.7 million from sales of our preferred stock; 81.6 million from borrowings under our previous term loan with SLR Investment Corp. and Silicon Valley Bank, our previous term loan under the Credit Agreement and Guaranty (the Oaktree Agreement with Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (collectively Oaktree ), and the Credit Agreement and Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement with Perceptive Credit Holdings IV, LP; 13.5 million from sales of convertible notes; 50.2 million from our public offering of common stock in 2020; 46.6 million from our public offering of common stock in 2022; 53.5 million from our public offering of common stock in 2024; 14.4 million from the sale of common stock in our 2019 at-the-market offering; and 15.2 million from the sale of common stock in our 2021 at-the-market offering. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 91.5 million. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions in amounts that may exceed federally insured limits. Our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the available proceeds from the Credit Agreement and the Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement, will be sufficient to meet our cash commitments for at least the next 12 months after the date that the interim condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 
 On March 23, 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement (the "2021 ATM Agreement") with Cowen and Company LLC ("Cowen") to sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, with aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to 50.0 million, through an at-the-market equity offering program under which Cowen will act as our sales agent. On March 13, 2024, we amended the 2021 ATM Agreement by issuing a the 2024 ATM Agreement. As of March 13, 2024, we had sold a total of 1,726,043 2021 ATM Shares under the 2021 ATM Program at a weighted average gross selling price of 9.01 per share for net proceeds of 15.2 million. 
 On March 13, 2024, we amended and restated the 2021 ATM Agreement where we entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement with Cowen with respect to an at-the-market offering program under which we could offer and sell the 2024 ATM Shares, having an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0 million through Cowen as its sales agent (the "2024 ATM Program"). The offering and sale of the 2024 ATM Shares will be made pursuant to the our shelf registration statement of Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on March 22, 2024. There were no shares issued under the 2024 ATM Program as of June 30, 2024. Please see Note 10. Stockholders Equity to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information. 
 On August 9, 2024, we entered into the Credit Agreement and Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement. The Credit Agreement established a 75.0 million term loan facility, consisting of (i) 50.0 million funded immediately and (ii) 25.0 million that we may borrow in a single borrowing on or prior to March 31, 2026. Under the Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement, in exchange for the Purchaser's payment to us of a purchase price of 50.0 million, in the aggregate, we have agreed to sell to the Purchaser its right to receive payment in full of a tiered single digit percentage of net sales of FUROSCIX. In connection with the Credit Agreement, we paid off all unpaid borrowings under the Oaktree Agreement on August 9, 2024, including the 1.0 million exit fee and a prepayment premium of 2.6 million. 
 On August 12, 2024, we entered into the Underwriting Agreement with the Underwriters, relating to an underwritten offering of 12,000,000 shares of our Common Stock and, in lieu of Common Stock to select investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of Common Stock. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, we also granted the Underwriters an option exercisable for 30 days to purchase up to an additional 1,875,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of 4.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. On August 12, 2024, the Underwriters exercised this option in full. The closing of the offering (including the sale of the Shares subject to the Underwriters option to purchase additional shares) took place on August 13, 2024. The net proceeds from the offering were 53.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 
 
 We expect to incur substantial additional expenditures in the near future to support our ongoing activities and commercialization of FUROSCIX. We expect our costs and expenses to increase in the future as we continue U.S. commercialization of FUROSCIX, including the expansion of our direct sales force, and as we continue to make substantial expenditures on research and 
 29 

30 

 development, including to increase our manufacturing capacity and for conducting clinical trials of our product candidates. Additionally, we continue to incur additional costs as a result of operating as a public company. We plan to continue to fund our operations through cash and cash equivalents on hand. Additionally, we expect to have access to funds pursuant to our at-the-market offering program with Cowen and Company, LLC, or we could otherwise seek additional funding through a combination of public or private equity offerings if we believe additional resources are needed. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including without limitation: 
 the costs and expenses of expanding our U.S. sales and marketing infrastructure; 

the costs and expenses related to the manufacturing of FUROSCIX and our agreements with third-party manufacturers; 

the degree of success we experience in commercializing FUROSCIX; 

the revenue generated by sales of FUROSCIX and of other product candidates that may be approved; 

the pricing and reimbursement of FUROSCIX and of other product candidates that may be approved; 

the costs, timing and outcomes of clinical trials and regulatory reviews associated with our product candidates; 

the emergence of competing or complementary technological developments; 

the extent to which FUROSCIX is adopted by the healthcare community; 

the number and types of future products we develop and commercialize; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and 

the extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses. 

Additional financing may not be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We may raise funds in equity, royalty-based or debt financings or enter into additional credit facilities in order to access funds for our capital needs. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our Company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds through royalty-based financing arrangements, we will likely agree to relinquish rights to potentially valuable future revenue streams and may agree to covenants that restrict our operations or strategic flexibility. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future would cause us to incur additional debt service expenses and could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, delay clinical trials necessary to market our products, or delay establishment or expansion of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products. For example, the trading prices for our and other biopharmaceutical companies securities have been highly volatile as a result of macroeconomic conditions and developments in our industry. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital through sales of our securities and any such sales may be on unfavorable terms. Additionally, our ability to raise capital may be further impacted by global macroeconomic conditions including, for example, as a result of international political conflict and/or instability, including due to war or terrorism, supply chain issues and rising inflation and interest rates.

 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 55.4 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of 66.3 million and an increase in net operating assets of 13.3 million. This was offset by non-cash charges of 24.2 million. The increase in net operating assets is related to accounts receivable and inventory to support the ongoing commercial operations of FUROSCIX. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation, amortization related to our right-of-use leased assets, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to amortization of debt discount associated with the Oaktree Agreement, the fair value adjustments to the derivative liability, term loan and revenue purchase and sale liability, debt issuance costs, and the loss on the extinguishment of the Oaktree Agreement and accretion of premium on investments. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 44.1 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of 41.0 million and an increase in net operating assets of 5.8 million. This was offset by non-cash charges of 2.7 million. The increase in net operating assets is related to accounts receivable and inventory to support the launch of FUROSCIX. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation, amortization related to our right-of-use leased assets, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense related to amortization of debt discount associated with the Oaktree Agreement, the fair value adjustment to the derivative liability and accretion of premium on investments. 
 Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 29.3 million, consisting of maturities of short-term investments. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 6.5 million, consisting primarily of purchases of short-term investments, net of maturities. 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 70.7 million due to proceeds from the Perceptive Financing, proceeds from the sale of common stock, purchases pursuant to our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and stock option exercises, offset by the payoff off of the Oaktree Agreement, and related fees, and amounts paid to settle restricted stock unit tax withholding obligations. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 14.4 million, consisting of proceeds from the 2021 ATM Agreement, purchases pursuant to our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and stock option exercises. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. Our critical accounting policies are more fully described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report. There have been no material changes to that information disclosed in our Annual Report during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. 	 Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
 We contract with vendors in foreign countries. As such, we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies, principally the Swiss franc and Euro, associated with our foreign transactions. We believe this exposure to be immaterial. We currently do not hedge against this exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. 
 
 Our exposure to market risk also relates to interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. We have elected the fair value option for certain liabilities. The fair value of the liabilities related to the Credit Agreement and the Revenue Purchase and Sale Agreement will increase as market interest rates decrease. In addition, the fair 
 31 

32 

 value of the liabilities may fluctuate based upon changes in the Company's credit rating. Changes in the interest rate environment and the credit rating of the Company could have an effect on our future earnings. 
 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business. However, if our costs, in particular costs related to manufacture and supply, were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, it may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Item 4. 	 Controls an d Procedures. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date were not effective at a reasonable assurance level due to the continued material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below and in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, in our Annual Report which was filed on March 13, 2024. 
 
 In light of the identified material weakness, we performed additional analysis and other procedures around the review of the calculation performed by our third-party valuation specialist. 
 
 Previously Reported Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 As previously disclosed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, on Form 10-K filed March 13, 2024, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified a deficiency resulting in a material weakness further described below. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Beginning with the preparation of our financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, management identified a material weakness related to the controls, processes and procedures over the fair value accounting associated with its financial liabilities measured at fair value. Please see Note 9, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a description of the financial liabilities. Specifically, the calculations performed by our third-party valuation specialist during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and third quarter of fiscal 2024 as it relates to fair value accounting for the liabilities included errors resulting in an overstatement in the fair values. We made adjustments necessary to properly reflect the fair value of the instruments in the financial statements, as applicable, included in our Annual Report and in this Quarterly Report. There were no changes to previously released financial results as a result of this material weakness. 
 
 Remediation Plan 
 Management is actively working to remediate the identified material weakness and is committed to remediating the material weakness in a timely manner. Our remediation process is ongoing and includes the following steps, but is not limited to the following: 
 (a) additional quality control processes implemented by our third-party valuation specialist, 
 (b) detailed discussions around changes in assumptions used in the valuation and their effect on the valuation, and 
 (c) more thorough review of sample iterations used in determining the fair value of the derivative. 
 While the audit committee of our board of directors and senior management are closely monitoring the remediation efforts, until the remediation efforts discussed in this section, including any additional remediation efforts that our senior management identifies as necessary, are complete, tested and determined effective, we will not be able to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the controls are in place for a period of time and management concludes based on its evaluation that these controls are properly designed and operating effectively. 
 
 32 

33 

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the material weakness described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. 	 Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently aware of any such proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Item 1A. 	 Ri sk Factors 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Information regarding risk factors appears in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "Annual Report"), which was filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report.
