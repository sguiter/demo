 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (amounts
in these accompanying notes are presented in thousands, except number of shares and per-share amounts.) 

million and million of revenues for the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2024, respectively, however the Company expects to continue to experience recurring losses and to generate negative cash flows from operating activities in the
near future. 

The
Company incurred a net loss attributable to Lucid Diagnostics Inc common stockholders of approximately million and had net cash
flows used in operating activities of approximately million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. As of September
30, 2024, the Company had working capital of approximately million, with such working capital inclusive of the Senior Secured Convertible
Note classified as a current liability of approximately million and approximately million of cash. 

The
Company s ability to continue operations 12 months beyond the issuance of the financial statements, will depend upon generating
substantial revenue that is conditioned upon obtaining positive third-party reimbursement coverage for its EsoGuard Esophageal DNA Test
from both government and private health insurance providers, increasing revenue through contracting directly with self-insured employers,
and on its ability to raise additional capital through various potential sources including equity and/or debt financings or refinancing
existing debt obligations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year after the date the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 

Note
3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued 

The
key aspects considered by the Company include the following: 

Contracts The
Company s customer is primarily the patient, but the Company does not enter into a formal reimbursement contract with a patient.
The Company establishes a contract with a patient in accordance with other customary business practices, which is the point in time an
order is received from a provider and a patient specimen has been returned to the laboratory for testing. Payment terms are a function
of a patient s existing insurance benefits, including the impact of coverage decisions with Center for Medicare Medicaid
Services CMS and applicable reimbursement contracts established between the Company and payers. However, when a patient
is considered self-pay, the Company requires payment from the patient prior to the commencement of the Company s performance obligations.
The Company s consideration can be deemed variable or fixed depending on the structure of specific payer contracts, and the Company
considers collection of such consideration to be probable to the extent that it is unconstrained. 

Performance
obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service (or a bundle of goods
or services) to the customer. The Company s contracts have a single performance obligation, which is satisfied upon rendering of
services, which culminates in the release of a patient s test result to the ordering healthcare provider. The Company elects the
practical expedient related to the disclosure of unsatisfied performance obligations, as the duration of time between providing testing
supplies, the receipt of a sample, and the release of a test result to the ordering healthcare provider is far less than one year. 

Transaction
price The transaction price is the amount of consideration that the Company expects to collect in exchange for transferring
promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example, some sales taxes). The
consideration expected to be collected from a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. 

If
the consideration derived from the contracts is deemed to be variable, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it
will be entitled in exchange for the promised goods or services. The Company limits the amount of variable consideration included in
the transaction price to the unconstrained portion of such consideration. In other words, the Company recognizes revenue up to the amount
of variable consideration that is not subject to a significant reversal until additional information is obtained or the uncertainty associated
with the additional payments or refunds is subsequently resolved. 

When
the Company does not have significant historical experience or that experience has limited predictive value, the constraint over estimates
of variable consideration may result in no revenue being recognized upon delivery of patient EsoGuard test results to the ordering healthcare
provider. As such, the Company recognizes revenue up to the amount of variable consideration not subject to a significant reversal until
additional information is obtained or the uncertainty associated with additional payments or refunds, if any, is subsequently resolved.
Differences between original estimates and subsequent revisions, including final settlements, represent changes in estimated expected
variable consideration, with the change in estimate recognized in the period of such revised estimate. With respect to a contracted service
arrangement, the fixed consideration revenue is recognized on an as-billed basis upon delivery of the laboratory test report with realization
of such fixed consideration deemed probable based upon actual historical experience. 

Allocate
transaction price The transaction price is allocated entirely to the performance obligation contained within the contract with
a customer on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices of each distinct good or service. 

Practical
Expedients The Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component, as at contract
inception, the Company expects the collection cycle to be one year or less. 

Note
3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued 

and , respectively, resulting
from the delivery of patient EsoGuard test results. Revenue recognized from customer contracts deemed to include a variable consideration
transaction price is limited to the unconstrained portion of the variable consideration. The Company s revenue for the three and
nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 was and , respectively, resulting from the delivery of patient EsoGuard test results. 

Cost
of Revenue 

The
cost of revenues principally includes the costs related to the Company s laboratory operations (excluding estimated costs associated
with research activities), the costs related to the EsoCheck cell collection device, cell sample mailing kits and license royalties. 

In
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, the cost of revenue was and , respectively, primarily related
to costs for our laboratory operations and EsoCheck device supplies. The Company s cost of revenue for the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2023 was and , respectively, primarily related to costs for our laboratory operations and EsoCheck
device supplies.

- Management Services Agreement 

The
Company s daily operations are also managed in part by personnel employed by PAVmed, for which the Company incurs a service
fee, referred to as the MSA Fee , according to the provisions of a Management Services Agreement MSA with PAVmed. The MSA does not have a termination date, but may be terminated by the Company s board of directors. The MSA Fee
is charged on a monthly basis and is subject-to periodic adjustment corresponding with changes in the services provided by PAVmed
personnel to the Company, with any such change in the MSA Fee being subject to approval of the boards of directors of each of the
Company and PAVmed. In March 2024, PAVmed and the Company were authorized by their respective boards of directors to enter, and they
did enter, into an eighth amendment to the MSA. Under this amendment, the monthly fee due from the Company to PAVmed was increased
from to ,
effective January 1, 2024. In August 2024, PAVmed and the Company were authorized by their respective boards of
directors to enter, and they did enter, into a ninth amendment to the MSA. Under this amendment, the monthly fee due from the
Company to PAVmed was increased from 
to ,
effective July 1, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, MSA fees were 
per month. 

On
January 26, 2024, PAVmed elected to receive payment of of fees and reimbursements due from Lucid, through the issuance of 
shares of Lucid Diagnostics common stock.

Total MSA Fee 

The
classification of the MSA Fee as presented above is based on the PAVmed classification of employee salary expense and other operating
expenses. In this regard, PAVmed classifies employee salary expense as sales and marketing expenses for employees performing sales, sales
support and marketing activities, research and development expenses for those employees who are engaged in product and services engineering
development and design and /or clinical trials activities, and other employees and activities classified as general and administrative. 

Transfer of Intellectual Property from PAVmed 

On September 27, 2024, the Company
entered into an Assignment of Patent Rights with PAVmed, pursuant to which PAVmed assigned certain patent rights to the Company related
to the EsoCheck device. In consideration of the assignment the Company agreed to pay PAVmed a assignment fee.

As
discussed in Note 10, Debt , the Company issued a Senior Secured Convertible Note dated March 21, 2023 with a million face
value principal March 2023 Senior Convertible Note ). The convertible note is accounted for under the ASC 825-10-15-4 fair
value option FVO election, wherein, the financial instrument is initially measured at its issue date estimated fair value
and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. 

Note
9 Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements - continued 

The
estimated fair value of the financial instruments classified within the Level 3 category was determined using both observable inputs
and unobservable inputs. Unrealized gains and losses associated with liabilities within the Level 3 category include changes in fair
value attributable to both observable (e.g., changes in market interest rates) and unobservable (e.g., changes in unobservable long-
dated volatilities) inputs.

The
estimated fair values reported utilized the Company s common stock price along with certain Level 3 inputs (as discussed in the
table above), in the development of Monte Carlo simulation models, discounted cash flow analyses, and /or Black-Scholes valuation models.
The estimated fair values are subjective and are affected by changes in inputs to the valuation models and analyses, including the Company s
common stock price, the Company s dividend yield, the risk-free rates based on U.S. Treasury security yields, and certain other
Level-3 inputs including, assumptions regarding the estimated volatility in the value of the Company s common stock price and the
volatility of similar entities within the medical device industry. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair
values.

Overview 

We
are a commercial-stage, cancer prevention medical diagnostics technology company focused on the millions of patients who are at risk
of developing esophageal precancer and cancer, specifically highly lethal esophageal adenocarcinoma EAC ). 

We
believe that our flagship product, the EsoGuard Esophageal DNA Test, performed on samples collected with the EsoCheck Esophageal Cell
Collection Device, constitutes the first and only commercially available diagnostic test capable of serving as a widespread tool for
the early detection of esophageal precancer, including Barrett s Esophagus BE ), in at-risk patients. Early detection
of esophageal precancer allows patients to undergo appropriate monitoring and treatment, as indicated by clinical practice guidelines,
in an effort to prevent progression to esophageal cancer. 

EsoGuard
is a bisulfite-converted targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) DNA assay performed on surface esophageal cells collected with EsoCheck.
It quantifies methylation at 31 sites on two genes, Vimentin (VIM) and Cyclin A1 (CCNA1). The assay has been evaluated in multiple studies,
demonstrating sensitivity of ~90 for detecting disease along the full esophageal precancer to cancer spectrum, with a negative predictive
value (NPV) of ~99 . Sensitivity and NPV remain very high even for detecting early precancer, which is unprecedented for a molecular
diagnostic test . 

EsoCheck
is an FDA 510(k) and CE Mark cleared noninvasive swallowable balloon capsule catheter device capable of sampling surface esophageal cells
in a less than five-minute office procedure. It consists of a vitamin pill-sized rigid plastic capsule tethered to a thin silicone catheter
from which a soft silicone balloon with textured ridges emerges to gently swab surface esophageal cells. When vacuum suction is applied,
the balloon and sampled cells are pulled into the capsule, protecting them from contamination and dilution by cells outside of the targeted
region during device withdrawal. We believe this proprietary Collect+Protect technology makes EsoCheck the only noninvasive esophageal
cell collection device capable of such anatomically targeted and protected sampling. 

EsoGuard
and EsoCheck are based on patented technology licensed by Lucid from Case Western Reserve University CWRU ). EsoGuard and
EsoCheck have been developed to provide an accurate, non-invasive, patient-friendly test for the early detection of EAC and BE, including
dysplastic BE and related precursors to EAC in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD ), commonly known as chronic heartburn, acid reflux, or just reflux.

Developments 

Business 

American Journal of Gastroenterology Publication 

On November 7, 2024, the Company
announced that its manuscript for its multi-center ESOGUARD BE-1 study has been accepted for publication in The American Journal of Gastroenterology,
the official journal of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG). This is the fourth publication presenting clinical validation
data for the Company s EsoGuard Esophageal DNA Test, and the second to demonstrate its performance in an intended-use screening
population. Consistent with previous studies, EsoGuard showed high sensitivity and negative predictive value in detecting esophageal precancer
(Barrett s Esophagus or BE). With the acceptance for publication, the Company believes we now have a complete clinical evidence package
to submit our data to the MolDX program and formally seek Medicare coverage. 

The prospective, multi-center study
presented data from a cohort of patients who met ACG guideline criteria for esophageal precancer screening and underwent non-endoscopic
EsoGuard testing followed by traditional upper endoscopy. EsoGuard sensitivity and negative predictive value for detecting BE were approximately
88 and 99 , respectively. Specificity and positive predictive value were approximately 81 and 30 , respectively. No serious adverse
events were reported.

issuable under the agreement to 19.99 of the shares outstanding as of the date of the amendment. 

On
January 26, 2024, in accordance with the MSA and the payroll, benefits and expense reimbursement agreement between PAVmed and Lucid PBERA ),
PAVmed elected to receive payment of approximately 4.7 million of fees and reimbursements accrued under the MSA and the PBERA through
the issuance of 3,331,771 shares of Lucid s common stock. 

FDA
Enforcement Discretion 

In
April 2024, FDA published the final rule under which FDA intends to phase out its general enforcement discretion approach for LDTs so
that IVDs manufactured by a laboratory would generally fall under the same enforcement approach as other IVDs (the proposed rule was
published in October 2023). In the final rule, FDA has expanded the categories of LDTs that will be eligible for continued enforcement
discretion, which categories include LDTs first marketed prior to May 6, 2024 and LDTs approved by New York State s Clinical Laboratory
Evaluation Program NYS CLEP ). As EsoGuard was marketed prior to the cutoff date, and is also NYS CLEP-approved, EsoGuard will remain
under continued enforcement discretion from FDA s premarket review requirements and quality systems requirements (except for record-keeping).
As such, there is no immediate impact from the final rule on Lucid s regulatory strategy. 

Appointment
of Dennis Matheis to Board of Directors 

On
May 6, 2024, the board of directors of the Company appointed Dennis Matheis as a Class C director of the Company (and he was
subsequently re-elected to the board, together with the incumbent Class C directors of the Company, at the Company s annual
shareholders meeting held on July 23, 2024). In connection with his joining the board, Mr. Matheis received a grant of an option to
acquire 241,500 shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the Company s Amended and Restated 2018 Long-Term
Incentive Equity Plan in accordance with the Company s existing compensation policy for non-employee directors.

NASDAQ
Notice 

On
June 21, 2024, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that, for the prior 30 consecutive
business days (through June 20, 2024), the closing bid price of the Company s common stock had been below the minimum of 1 per
share required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notification letter stated
that the Company would be afforded 180 calendar days (until December 18, 2024) to regain compliance, and that the Company could be eligible
for additional time. The Company intends to consider all available options to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards. 

Authorized
Shares Increase 

On
July 23, 2024, the Company filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate an increase in its authorized shares
from 200,000,000 to 300,000,000. Such increase was approved at the annual meeting
of the Company s stockholders held the same day. 

Lucid IP Matters 

On October 15, 2024, the Company
announced that it received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a patent application covering
its proprietary method of using methylation of the cyclin-A1 (CCNA1) gene to help detect esophageal precancer and cancer, a key component
of its EsoGuard Esophageal DNA Test. 

EsoGuard utilizes next-generation
sequencing (NGS) to assess DNA methylation at 31 sites on two genes, vimentin (VIM) and cyclin-A1 (CCNA1). Such methylation has been shown
to be strongly associated with conditions along the spectrum from early esophageal precancer (non-dysplastic Barrett s Esophagus or BE),
to late precancer (dysplastic BE), to cancer (esophageal adenocarcinoma). Although VIM methylation had been previously associated with
gastrointestinal neoplasias, the association of CCNA1 methylation with esophageal neoplasia is novel and appears to be more specific. 

Financing 

March
2023 Senior Convertible Note Refinancing 

On
November 8, 2024, the Company gave notice to the holder of the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note that it was exercising its right pursuant
to such note to redeem the same for the redemption price specified in such note (the Optional Redemption Price ). Pursuant
to the terms of the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note, the Company has not less than ten business days, and not more than twenty business
days, from the date of the notice (the Optional Redemption Notice Period to pay the Optional Redemption Price. 

To
finance the payment of the Optional Redemption Price, the Company has entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited
investors (the 2024 Note Investors ). Under the agreement, subject to customary closing conditions, the Company has agreed
to issue, and each 2024 Note Investor has agreed to purchase, 12.0 senior secured convertible notes due 2029 (collectively, the November
2024 Senior Convertible Notes ). As of the date hereof, the aggregate commitments of the 2024 Note Investors exceed the Optional
Redemption Price. 

The
Company expects to complete the issuance of the November 2024 Senior Convertible Notes and the redemption of the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note on or prior
to the end of the
Optional Redemption Notice Period, although there can be no assurance that such issuance and redemption will be completed
during such period, if at all. 

Series
B and Series B-1 Preferred Stock Offerings

Exchange ). Prior to the execution of the Series B Subscription Agreements and the Series B Exchange Agreements, we entered into
subscription agreements with certain of the Series B Investors providing for the sale to such investors of 5,670 shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of 1,000 per share, which shares the investors immediately agreed to exchange for shares of Series
B Preferred Stock pursuant to the Series B Exchange Agreements (and are included in the 10,670 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock set
forth above). Each share of the Series B Preferred Stock has a stated value of 1,000 and a conversion price of 1.2444. The terms of
the Series B Preferred Stock also include a one times preference on liquidation and a right to receive dividends equal to 20 of the

of the issuance date. The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock also will be entitled to dividends equal, on an as-if-converted to
shares of common stock basis, to and in the same form as dividends actually paid on shares of the common stock when, as, and if such
dividends are paid on shares of the common stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is a voting security. The aggregate gross proceeds of
these transactions were 18.16 million (inclusive of 5.67 million of aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock that was immediately exchanged for Series B Preferred Stock in the transactions). 

As
a result of 100 of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock being exchanged for shares

May 6, 2024, the Company issued approximately 11,634 shares of newly designated Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series
B-1 Preferred Stock ). The terms of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock are substantially identical to the terms of the Series B Preferred
Stock, except that the Series B-1 Preferred Stock has a conversion price of 0.7228. The aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares
in such offering were 11.6 million. 

The
aggregate gross proceeds from the issuances of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock were approximately 29.8 million.

Results
of Operations 

Overview 

Revenue 

The
Company recognized revenue resulting from the delivery of patient EsoGuard test results when the Company considered the collection of
such consideration to be probable to the extent that it is unconstrained. 

Cost
of revenue 

Cost
of revenues recognized from the delivery of patient EsoGuard test results includes costs related to EsoCheck device usage, shipment of
test collection kits, royalties and the cost of services to process tests and provide results to physicians. We incur expenses for tests
in the period in which the activities occur, therefore, gross margin as a percentage of revenue may vary from quarter to quarter due
to costs being incurred in one period that relate to revenues recognized in a later period. 

We
expect that the gross margin for our services will continue to fluctuate and be affected by EsoGuard test volume, our operating efficiencies,
patient compliance rates, payer mix, the levels of reimbursement, and payment patterns of payers and patients. 

Sales
and marketing expenses 

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for employees engaged in sales, sales support and marketing activities,
as well as the portion of the MSA Fee (as defined in Note 5, Related Party Transactions , to our accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements) allocated to sales and marketing expenses, which are principally costs related to PAVmed employees
who are performing services for the Company. We anticipate our sales and marketing expenses will increase in the future, to the extent
we expand our commercial sales and marketing operations as resources permit and insurance reimbursement coverage for our EsoGuard test
expands. 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional fees for accounting, tax, audit and legal services (including those fees
incurred as a result of our being a public company), consulting fees, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents within
our intellectual property portfolio, and certain employee costs, along with the portion of the MSA Fee allocated to general and administrative
expenses. 

We
anticipate our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to the extent our business operations grow. Furthermore,
we anticipate continued expenses related to being a public company, including fees and expenses for audit, legal, regulatory, tax-related
services, insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with maintaining compliance as a public company. 

Research
and development expenses 

Research
and development expenses are recognized in the period they are incurred and consist principally of internal and external expenses incurred
for the development of our technologies and conducting clinical trials, including: 

costs
 associated with regulatory filings; 
 
 patent
 license fees; 
 
 cost
 of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing, and manufacturing preclinical prototypes;
 and 
 
 the
 portion of the MSA Fee allocated to research and development. 

We
plan to incur research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our existing products as
well as new innovations. Our research and development activities, including our clinical trials, are focused principally on facilitating
insurer reimbursement, encouraging physician adoption and developing product improvements or extending the utility of the lead products
in our pipeline, including EsoCheck and EsoGuard. 

Other
Income and Expense, net 

Other
income and expense, net, consists principally of changes in fair value of our convertible note and losses on extinguishment of debt upon
repayment of such convertible note.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
current operational activities are principally focused on the commercialization of EsoGuard. We are pursuing commercialization
across multiple sales channels, including: the communication to and education of medical practitioners and clinicians regarding
EsoGuard; the establishment of Lucid Test Centers for the collection of cell samples using EsoCheck; use of our mobile testing unit;
ongoing #CheckYourFoodTube testing days; and our direct contracting strategic initiative (including in the concierge medicine and employer markets sectors). Additionally, we are developing expanded
clinical evidence to support insurance reimbursement adoption by government and private insurers. Further, as resources permit, the
Company also intends to pursue development of other products and services. 

Our
ability to generate revenue depends upon our ability to successfully advance the commercialization of EsoGuard, including significantly
expanding insurance reimbursement coverage, while also completing the clinical studies, product and service development, and necessary
regulatory approval thereof. There are no assurances, however, we will be able to obtain an adequate level of financial resources required
for the long-term commercialization and development of our products and services. 

We
are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties typically faced by medical device and diagnostic companies that devote
substantially all of their efforts to the commercialization of their initial products and services, to ongoing research and
development activities, and to conducting clinical trials. We experienced a net loss of approximately 34.0 million and used
approximately 34.3 million of cash in operations during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. Financing activities
provided 30.2 million of cash during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. We ended the quarter with cash on-hand of
 14.5 million as of September 30, 2024. We expect to continue to experience recurring losses and negative cash flow from operations,
and will continue to fund our operations with debt and/or equity financing transactions, which in accordance with management s
plans may include conversions of our existing debt to equity and refinancing our existing debt obligations to extend the maturity
date. The Company s ability to continue operations 12 months beyond the issuance of the financial statements will depend upon
generating substantial revenue that is conditioned on obtaining positive third-party reimbursement coverage for its EsoGuard
Esophageal DNA Test from both government and private health insurance providers, increasing revenue through contracting directly
with self-insured employers, and upon raising additional capital through various potential sources including equity and/or debt
financings or refinancing existing debt obligations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern within one year after the date the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
are issued. 

Preferred
Stock Offerings 

On
March 13, 2024, we entered into the Series B Subscription Agreements and Series B Exchange Agreements with the Series B Investors, which
agreements provided for (i) the sale to the Series B Investors of 12,495 shares of our newly designated Series B Preferred Stock, at
a purchase price of 1,000 per share, and (ii) the exchange by the Series B Investors of 13,625 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock
and 10,670 shares of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock held by them for 31,790 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Prior to the execution
of the Series B Subscription Agreements and the Series B Exchange Agreements, we entered into subscription agreements with certain of
the Series B Investors providing for the sale to such investors of 5,670 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of
 1,000 per share, which shares the investors immediately agreed to exchange for shares of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to the Series
B Exchange Agreements (and are included in the 10,670 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock set forth above). Each share of the Series
B Preferred Stock has a stated value of 1,000 and a conversion price of 1.2444. The terms of the Series B Preferred Stock also include
a one times preference on liquidation and a right to receive dividends equal to 20 of the number of shares of our common stock into
which such Series B Preferred Stock is convertible, payable on the one-year and two-year anniversary of the issuance date. The holders
of the Series B Preferred Stock also will be entitled to dividends equal, on an as-if-converted to shares of common stock basis, to and
in the same form as dividends actually paid on shares of the common stock when, as, and if such dividends are paid on shares of the common
stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is a voting security. The aggregate gross proceeds of these transactions were 18.16 million (inclusive
of 5.67 million of aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock that was immediately exchanged for Series
B Preferred Stock in the transactions). 

As
a result of 100 of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock being exchanged for shares
of Series B Preferred Stock in the Series B Offering and Exchange, no shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series A-1 Preferred Stock
remain outstanding. 

On
May 6, 2024, the Company issued approximately 11,634 shares of newly designated Series B-1 Preferred Stock. The terms of the Series B-1
Preferred Stock are substantially identical to the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, except that the Series B-1 Preferred Stock
has a conversion price of 0.7228. The aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares in such offering were 11.6 million. 

Private
Placement - Securities Purchase Agreement 

Effective
as of March 13, 2023, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Note SPA with an accredited institutional
investor, pursuant to which we agreed to sell, and the investor agreed to purchase the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note with a
face value principal of 11.1 million. We issued the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note on March 21, 2023 pursuant to the Note SPA.
The March 2023 Senior Convertible Note proceeds were 9.925 million after deducting a 1.186 million lender fee and offering
costs.

and Capital Resources - continued 

The
March 2023 Senior Convertible Note has a 7.875 annual stated interest rate, a contractual conversion price of 5.00 per share of the
Company s common stock (subject to standard adjustments in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization
or other similar transaction), and a contractual maturity date of the two-year anniversary of the date of issuance. The principal of
the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note and accrued interest thereon is convertible at the option of the holder into the Company s
common stock at the contractual conversion price. In addition, the principal of the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note amortizes over
18 months commencing six months after its issuance. The amortization payments and accrued interest on the March 2023 Senior Convertible
Note are payable in shares of the Company s common stock (subject to the satisfaction of certain customary equity conditions and
except for interest payable prior to September 21, 2023), at prices based on the then current market price. 

Under
the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note, the Company is subject to certain customary affirmative and negative covenants regarding the
incurrence of indebtedness, the existence of liens, the repayment of indebtedness and the making of investments, the payment of cash
in respect of dividends, distributions or redemptions, the transfer of assets, the maturity of other indebtedness, and transactions
with affiliates, among other customary matters. Under the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note, the Company is also subject to
financial covenants requiring that (i) the amount of the Company s available cash shall equal or exceed 5.0 million at all
times, (ii) the ratio of (a) the outstanding principal amount of the notes issued under the Note SPA, accrued and unpaid interest
thereon and accrued and unpaid late charges, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter commencing with September 30, 2023 to (b) the
Company s average market capitalization over the prior ten trading days, shall not exceed 30 , and (iii) the Company s
market capitalization shall at no time be less than 30 million (the Financial Tests ). As of September 30, 2024, the
Company was in compliance, and as of the date hereof, the Company is in compliance, with the Financial Tests. 

During
the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, approximately 2.4 million of principal repayments along with approximately 0.8 million
of interest expense thereon, were settled through the issuance of 4,777,898 shares of common stock of the Company, with such shares having
a fair value of approximately 4.3 million (with such fair value measured as the respective conversion date quoted closing price of the
common stock of the Company). 

March 2023 Senior Convertible Note Refinancing 

On November 8, 2024, the
Company gave notice to the holder of the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note that it was exercising its right pursuant to such note
to redeem the same for the Optional Redemption Price specified in such note. Pursuant to the terms of the March 2023 Senior
Convertible Note, the Company has not less than ten business days, and not more than twenty business days, from the date of the
notice (which we sometimes refer to as the Optional Redemption Notice Period to pay the Optional Redemption
Price. 

To finance the payment of
the Optional Redemption Price, the Company has entered into a securities purchase agreement with the 2024 Note Investors. Under the
agreement, subject to customary closing conditions, the Company has agreed to issue, and each 2024 Note Investor has agreed to
purchase, the November 2024 Senior Convertible Notes, which are 12.0 senior secured convertible notes due 2029. As of the date hereof, the aggregate commitments of the 2024 Note Investors
exceed the Lucid Optional Redemption Price. 

The Company expects to complete
the issuance of the November 2024 Senior Convertible Notes and the redemption of the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note on or prior to
the end of the Optional Redemption Notice Period, although there can be no assurance that such issuance and redemption will be completed
during such period, if at all

Liquidity and Capital Resources - continued 

The Company expects to complete
the issuance of the November 2024 Senior Convertible Notes and the redemption of the March 2023 Senior Convertible Note on or prior to
the end of the Optional Redemption Notice Period, although there can be no assurance that such issuance and redemption will be completed
during such period, if at all. 

Committed
Equity Facility and ATM Facility 

In
March 2022, we entered into a committed equity facility with a Cantor affiliate. Under the terms of the committed equity facility, the
Cantor affiliate has committed to purchase up to 50 million of our common stock from time to time at our request. While there are distinct
differences, the committed equity facility is structured similarly to a traditional at-the-market equity facility, insofar as it allows
us to raise primary equity capital on a periodic basis at prices based on the existing market price. Cumulatively, a total of 680,263
shares of common stock of the Company have been issued through our committed equity facility for net proceeds of approximately 1.8 million, after a 4 discount, as of September
30, 2024. 

In
November 2022, Lucid Diagnostics also entered into an at-the-market offering for up to 6.5 million of its common stock
that may be offered and sold under a Controlled Equity Offering Agreement between Lucid Diagnostics and Cantor. Cumulatively, a total
of 230,068 shares of the Company have been issued through our at-the-market equity facility for net proceeds of approximately 0.3 million,
after payment of 3 commissions, as of September 30, 2024. 

Intercompany
Agreements with PAVmed 

From
our inception in May 2018 through our initial public offering in October 2021, our operations were funded by PAVmed providing
working capital cash advances and by PAVmed paying certain operating expenses on our behalf. Additionally, our daily operations have
been and continue to be conducted in part by personnel employed by PAVmed, for which we incur an MSA Fee expense. The MSA Fee is
charged on a monthly basis and is subject to periodic adjustment corresponding with changes in the services provided by PAVmed
personnel to the Company, with any such change in the MSA Fee being subject to approval of the Company and PAVmed boards of
directors. In March 2024, PAVmed and the Company were authorized by their respective boards of directors to enter, and they did
enter, into a eighth amendment to the MSA. Under this amendment, the monthly fee due from the Company to PAVmed was increased from
 750 to 833, effective Janaury 1, 2024. In August 2024, PAVmed and the Company were authorized by their respective boards of
directors to enter, and they did enter, into a ninth amendment to the MSA. Under this amendment, the monthly fee due from the
Company to PAVmed was increased from 833 to 1,050, effective July 1, 2024. Pursuant
to the MSA, as amended, PAVmed may elect to receive payment of the monthly MSA Fee in cash or in shares of our common stock,
with such shares valued at the volume weighted average price VWAP during the final ten trading days of the
applicable month (subject to a floor price of 0.70 per share). However, in no event will PAVmed be entitled to receive under the
MSA, as amended, from and after the date of the eighth amendment to the MSA, more than 9,644,135 shares of our common stock
(representing 19.99 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of immediately prior to the execution of the eighth
amendment). 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a Due To: PAVmed Inc. payment obligation liability of approximately 0.1 million, which liability is primarily
comprised of our obligations under a payroll and benefit expense reimbursement agreement (the PBERA and the MSA, as well
other operating expenses paid by PAVmed on our behalf. See our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements Note
5 , Related Party Transactions. In accordance with the MSA and the PBERA, on January 26, 2024, PAVmed elected to receive payment
of approximately 4.7 million of fees and reimbursements accrued under the MSA and the PBERA through the issuance of 3,331,771 shares
of the Company s common stock.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP ). The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reporting in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing
basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgements. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies are as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on March 25, 2024. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting
policies and estimates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)

including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required

has been no change in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
