million and US million, and continuing cash outflow of US million and US million from operating activities
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had accumulated
a deficit of US million and US million, and as of September 30, 2024, the Company had negative working capital of US million.
The Company s management believes these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern for the next twelve months. In assessing the Company s going concern, the Company s management monitors and analyzes
the Company s cash on-hand and its ability to generate sufficient revenue sources in the future to support its operating and capital
expenditure commitments. The Company s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital
expenditure obligations. Direct offering and debt financing have been utilized to finance the working capital requirements of the Company.
The continuation of the Company as a going concern through the next twelve months is dependent on the continued financial support from
its stockholders. 

Despite
those negative financial trends, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had taken the following actions to enhance the Company s liquidity: 

1) 
 On
 June 20, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain non-U.S. investors (the

Factors
Affecting Financial Performance 

We
believe that the following factors will affect our financial performance: 

Increasing
demand for our products We believe that the increasing demand for our products will have a positive impact on our financial
position. We plan to develop new products and expand our distribution network as well as to grow our business through possible mergers
and acquisitions of similar or synergetic businesses, all aimed at increasing awareness of our brand, developing customer loyalty, meeting
customer demands in various markets and providing solid foundations for our growth. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, however, we
do not have any agreements, undertakings or understandings to acquire any such entities and there can be no guarantee that we ever will. 

Maintaining
effective control of our costs and expenses - Successful cost control depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain adequate
material supplies as required by our operations at competitive prices. We will focus on improving our long-term cost control strategies
including establishing long-term alliances with certain suppliers to ensure adequate supply is maintained. We will carry forward the
economies of scale and advantages from our nationwide distribution network and diversified offerings. 

Economic
and Political Risks 

Our
operations are conducted primarily in the PRC and subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with
companies operating in North America and/or Western Europe. These include risks with, among others, the political, economic and legal
environment and foreign currency exchange. Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and social conditions in
the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversions,
remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP requires
the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity
and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material
impact on financial condition or operating performance. While we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other
factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements require significant judgments and estimates. For additional information relating to these and other accounting policies,
see Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

46 

Use
of Estimates 

Significant
estimates required to be made by management include, but are not limited to, useful lives of property and equipment, and intangible assets,
the recoverability of long-lived assets, assessment of expected credit losses for accounts receivable and other current asset, the valuation
allowance of deferred taxes and inventory reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Credit
Losses 

On
July 1, 2023, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement
of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that
is referred to as the current expected credit loss CECL methodology. The adoption of the credit loss accounting standard
has no material impact on our consolidated financial statements as of July 1, 2023. 

Our
account receivables and other receivables included in other current assets on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets are
within the scope of ASC Topic 326. We make estimates of expected credit and collectability trends for the allowance for credit losses
based upon assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable and other receivables balances,
credit-worthiness of the customers and other debtors, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic
conditions, and other factors that may affect its ability to collect from the customers and other debtors. We also provide specific provisions
for allowance when facts and circumstances indicate that the receivable is unlikely to be collected. 

ASC
Topic 326 is also applicable to loans to third parties that are included in the other current assets on the unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheets. Management estimates the allowance for credit losses on loans that do not share similar risk characteristics on an individual
basis. The key factors considered when determining the above allowances for credit losses include estimated loan collection schedule,
discount rate, and assets and financial performance of the borrowers. 

Expected
credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income (loss)
and comprehensive income (loss). After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance.
In the event we recover amounts previously reserved for, we will reduce the specific allowance for credit losses. 

Inventories,
Net 

Inventories,
which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, consist of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods related
to our products. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business less any costs to complete and
sell products. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. We periodically evaluate our inventory and records an inventory
reserve for certain inventories that may not be saleable or whose cost exceeds net realizable value. As of September 30, 2024 and June
30, 2024, the inventory reserve was nil and US 30,443, respectively. 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
generate our revenue primarily through sales of Luobuma products, other agricultural products, healthy meals and rapid diagnostic and
other products, as well as providing logistic services and other processing services to external customers in accordance with ASC 606.
ASC 606 establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from the entity s contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue
to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled
to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. 

47 

With
the adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenue is recognized when all of the following five steps
are met: (i) identify the contract(s) with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the
transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; (v) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance
obligation is satisfied. The Company has assessed the impact of the guidance by reviewing its existing customer contracts to identify
differences that will result from applying the new requirements, including the evaluation of its performance obligations, transaction
price, customer payments, transfer of control, and principal versus agent considerations. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company evaluates
whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. When
the Company is a principal, that the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customers,
the revenue should be recognized in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified
goods or services transferred. When the Company is an agent and its obligation is to facilitate third parties in fulfilling their performance
obligation for specified goods or services, the revenue should be recognized in the net amount for the amount of commission which the
Company earns in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by other parties. Based on the assessment,
the Company concluded that there was no change to the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for its current revenue streams in scope
of Topic 606 and therefore there was no material changes to the Company s financial statements upon adoption of ASC 606. 

More
specifically, revenue related to our products and services is generally recognized as follows: 

Sales
of products: We recognized revenue from the sale of products at the point in time when the goods were delivered and title to the
goods passed to the customer, provided that there were no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; persuasive evidence of an arrangement
existed; the sales price was fixed or determinable; and collectability was deemed probable. 

Revenue
from provision of services: The Company merely acts as an agent in these types of services transactions. Revenue from domestic air
and overland freight forwarding services was recognized at the point in time upon the performance of services as stipulated in the underlying
contract or when commodities were being released from the customer s warehouse; the service price was fixed or determinable; and
collectability was deemed probable. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

We
follow the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value,
prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value
as follows: 

Level
1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs, other than quoted prices in level, that are observable for the asset or
liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities
in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant
inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 

Level
3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement
of the fair value of the asset or liability. 

The
carrying value of financial instruments included in current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term
nature of these instruments.

innovative rapid diagnostic and other products and related medical devices for the most common diseases; this segment is conducted through
Biowin. Second, producing, processing and distributing silk products, and providing fruit trading business; this segment is conducted

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from sales of rapid diagnostic and other products was US 121,865 and
US 135,127, respectively, representing a decrease of US 13,262, or 9.81 . The decrease was mainly due to a decline in orders we
received from our customers, which resulted from the slow recovery of post pandemic economy in China, as well as a decrease in
selling prices as we tried to clear some of our remaining stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

49 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from sales of other agricultural products was US 2,051,471 and
US 1,510,730, respectively, representing an increase of US 540,741, or 35.79 . The increase was because we had three months of
revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to two months of revenue during the same period last year as we completed the acquisition of Wintus on July 31, 2023. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from sales of healthy meal products was US 949 and nil, respectively, representing
an increase of US 949, or 100.00 . The increase was mainly due to revenue generated by our subsidiary, Fuzhou Meida, which only started
to generate revenue in October 2023.

however, cost of revenue from sales of rapid diagnostic and other products increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024,
which was mainly due to the clearance of our remaining stock, as discussed in Gross Profit below. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue from sales of other agricultural products was US 1,824,720 and
US 1,502,739, respectively, representing an increase of US 321,981, or 21.43 . The increase was because we had three months of cost during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to two months of cost during the same period last year as we completed the acquisition of Wintus on July
31, 2023. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of revenue from sales of healthy meal products was US 249 and nil, respectively,
representing an increase of US 249, or 100.00 . The increase was mainly due to cost of revenue generated by our subsidiary, Fuzhou Meida,
which only started to generate revenue in October 2023.

Gross
profit from sales of rapid diagnostic and other products decreased by US 26,403, or 28.90 , for the three months ended September 30,
2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in gross profit was due to the decrease in sales as well as the decrease
in our selling prices as we tried to clear some of our remaining stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Gross
profit from sales of other agricultural products increased by US 218,589, or 2,874.66 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024

General
and Administrative Expenses 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our general and administrative expenses were US 2,636,575, representing a decrease of US 622,890,
or 19.11 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the decreased professional service fee in relation
to the acquisition of Wintus of approximately US 780,000, as well as a decrease in staff compensation in relation to the issuance of
restricted shares to the management of approximately US 400,000. The decrease was partially offset by the increased allowance for credit
losses and doubtful accounts of approximately US 519,000. 

Selling
Expenses 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our selling expenses were US 32,241, representing a decrease of US 15,592, or 32.60 , as compared
to the same period in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the implementation of cost control measurements, as we reduced the number
of sales personnel and cut down the spending on selling activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our research and development expenses were US 13,418, representing a decrease of US 10,280,
or 43.38 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to less research and development activities towards products
development during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as we tried to control our costs during the three months ended September
30, 2024. 

Amortization
of Debt Issuance and Other Costs 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our amortization of debt issuance and other costs expenses was US 188,712, representing
an increase of US 21,889, or 13.12 , as compared to amortization of debt issuance and other costs expenses of US 166,823 for the
same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to the increased amortization of extension fee as the Company signed certain
extension amendments with the investor to extend the maturity date of the convertible notes for one more year. 

51 

Interest
Expenses, Net 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net interest expenses were US 222,316, representing a decrease of US 146,895, or
39.79 , as compared to net interest expenses of US 369,211 in the same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest expenses was
mainly attributable to the increased interest income generated from loans to third parties, which was partially offset by the
increased interest expenses on short-term and long-term loans borrowed by Wintus. We had three months of interest expenses on loans
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to two months of interest expenses on loans during the same period last
year as we completed the acquisition of Wintus on July 31, 2023. 

Benefit
for Income Taxes 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our benefit for income taxes was US 292,951, representing an increase of US 41,585, or 16.54 ,
as compared to benefit for income taxes of US 251,366 in the same period in 2023. The increase in benefit for income taxes was mainly
due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the amortization of intangible assets, which are trademarks, patents and
land use rights that were revalued upon the acquisition of Wintus. 

Net
Loss from Continuing Operations 

Our
net loss from continuing operations was US 2,558,128 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of US 954,995, or
27.18 , from net loss from continuing operations of US 3,513,123 in the same period in 2023. The decrease in net loss from
continuing operations was primarily a result of the increase in gross profit and a decrease in general and administrative expenses
and interest expenses. 

Net
Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations 

As
mentioned above, due to the acquisition of Wintus mentioned above, the Company s Luobuma, Agricultural Products and Freight Services
business segments, that are operated by the Tenet-Jove Disposal Group, are reclassified as discontinued operations on the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. We had a total net income from discontinued operations of nil and US 8,855,247
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The
summarized operating results of our discontinued operations included in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income (loss)

net loss was US 2,558,128 for the three months ended September 30 , 2024, as compared to a
net income of US 5,342,124 for the same period in 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily a result of the decreased net income from

Comprehensive
Income (Loss) 

The
comprehensive loss was US 2,370,422 for the three months ended September 30 , 2024 , an
increase of US 7,810,511 from a comprehensive income of US 5,440,089 for the three months ended September 30 ,

attributable to us in the amount of US 5,480,633 for the three months ended September 30 ,
2023 . The increase in comprehensive loss was due to the increased net loss discussed above. 

Treasury
Policies 

We
have established treasury policies with the objectives of achieving effective control of treasury operations and of lowering cost of
funds. Therefore, funding for all operations and foreign exchange exposure have been centrally reviewed and monitored from the top level.
To manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates on specific transactions and foreign currency borrowings,
currency structured instruments and other appropriate financial instruments will be used to hedge material exposure, if any. 

Our
policy precludes us from entering into any derivative contracts purely for speculative activities. Through our treasury policies, we
aim to: 

(a)
Minimize interest risk 

This
is accomplished by loan re-financing and negotiation. We will continue to closely monitor the total loan portfolio and compare the loan
margin spread under our existing agreements against the current borrowing interest rates under different currencies and new offers from
banks. 

(b)
Minimize currency risk 

In
view of the current volatile currency market, we will closely monitor the foreign currency borrowings at the company level. As of September
30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, except the above-mentioned convertible note, we did not engage in any foreign currency borrowings or loan
contracts. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
currently finance our business operations primarily through advances from our related parties, short-term and long-term loans, convertible
notes and the sale of our common stock. Our current cash primarily consists of cash on hand and cash in bank, which is unrestricted as
to withdrawal and use and is deposited with banks in China. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had approximately US 13.7 million in short-term bank loans and US 1.8 million in long-term bank loans outstanding.
We expect that we will be able to renew all of the existing bank loans upon their maturity based on our past experience and outstanding
credit history.

of approximately US 6.4 million were received, and the remaining proceeds were fully received in July 2024, and all of the Shares were
issued on July 8, 2024. 

54 

On

relating to the underwritten public offering (the Offering of 77,882 shares of the Common Stock at a public offering price of US 25.68 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately US 2.0 million, prior

On

third party to the Company (collectively, the Purchasers ). Pursuant to the SPA, the Purchasers agree to purchase, and the

per share (the Shares ), at a purchase price of US 13.20 per share, and for an aggregate purchase price of US 8,241,750
(the Offering ). The SPA, the transaction contemplated thereby, and the issuance of the Shares have been approved by the
Company s board of directors. The closing of the transaction contemplated by the SPA took place on September 10, 2024. As of September
30, 2024, proceeds of approximately US 4.4 million were received, and the remaining proceeds are expected to be fully received by December
31, 2024. 

As
disclosed in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had recurring net losses from continuing
operations of US 2.6 million and US 3.5 million, and cash outflow of US 2.1 million and US 1.3 million from operating activities from
continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024,
the Company had accumulated a deficit of US 56.4 million and US 54.3 million, and as of September 30, 2024, the Company had negative
working capital of US 7.3 million. The Company s management believes these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. In assessing the Company s going concern, the Company s
management monitors and analyzes the Company s cash on-hand and its ability to generate sufficient revenue sources in the future
to support its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements,
operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. Direct offering and debt financing have been utilized to finance the working
capital requirements of the Company. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through the next twelve months is dependent on
the continued financial support from its stockholders. The Company s management believes that the Company s current access
to loans, equity financing as well as financial support from its shareholders will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs for
at least the next 12 months. The Company intends to continue to carefully execute its growth plans and manage market risk. If the Company
fails to satisfy the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC s Nasdaq continued listing requirements, such as the corporate governance
requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist its common stock. Any continuing failure to
remain in compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing standards and any subsequent failure to timely resume compliance with Nasdaq s
continued listing standards within the applicable cure period could have adverse consequences and, among other things, substantially
impair the Company s ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer
development opportunities for the Company. 

Working
Capital 

The
following table provides the information about our working capital as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024:

The
working capital decreased slightly by US 646,697, or 9.7 , as of September 30, 2024 from June 30, 2024, primarily as a result of an increase

assets, as well as a decrease in other payables and accrued expenses.

on our review, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report due
to following material weaknesses: 

a
 lack of full-time U.S. GAAP personnel in the accounting department to monitor the recording of the transactions; and 

a
 lack of segregation of duties for accounting personnel who prepared and reviewed the journal entries. 

In
order to address the above material weaknesses, our management has taken the following steps: 

recruiting
 sufficient qualified professionals with appropriate levels of knowledge and experience to assist in reviewing and resolving accounting
 issues in routine or complex transactions. To mitigate the reporting risks, we engaged an outside professional consulting firm to
 supplement our efforts to improve our internal control over financial reporting; 

improving
 the communication between management, board of directors, and the Chief Financial Officer; and 

obtaining
 proper approval for other significant and non-routine transactions from the board of directors. 

We
are committed to monitoring the effectiveness of these measures and making any changes that are necessary and appropriate. 

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Because of its inherent limitations,
a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system
contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

Other
than ordinary routine litigation (of which we are not currently involved), we know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings
against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation, and there are no proceedings in which
any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest
adverse to our company except as set forth below: 

On
May 16, 2017, Ms. Guiqin Li (the Plaintiff commenced a lawsuit against the Company in the People s Court of Chongqing
Pilot Free Trade Zone of China. Plaintiff alleged that due to the misguidance given by the Company s securities trading department,
the Plaintiff did not manage to complete the sales of the Company s common stock on the day of the Company s initial public
offering in the United States. As the price of the Company s common stock continued falling after initial public offering, the
Plaintiff incurred losses and hence is seeking monetary damages against the Company. Based on the judgment of the initial trial, the
Company was required to pay the Plaintiff a settlement payment, including the monetary compensation, interests and other legal fees. 

In
January 2023, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release with the Plaintiff, pursuant to which the Company paid the
Plaintiff a total sum of US 700,645 (approximately RMB 4.8 million) as settlement payment, and upon acceptance of the settlement payment
from the Company, the Plaintiff waived, released, and forever discharged the Company from all past and future claims. As of June 30,
2023, the Company has made the payments in full to the Plaintiff according to the Settlement Agreement and Release. 

On
November 26, 2021, the Company filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County against Lei Zhang and
Yan Li, as defendants, and Transhare Corporation, as a nominal defendant, asserting that defendants had not paid for certain restricted
shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to stock purchase agreements they executed with the Company. In December, defendants
filed an answer and counterclaim against the Company, which they amended on January 27, 2022 after the Company moved to dismiss their
counterclaims. They brought claims for, among others, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and
fraud, asserting that the Company made false and materially misleading statements, specifically regarding the sale of such shares to
Lei Zhang and Yan Li and the removal of their restrictive legends. Defendants are seeking money damages of at least 9 million, punitive
damages of 10 million, plus interest, costs, and fees. In April 2022, the Court granted the Company s motion for a preliminary
injunction to restrain the Company s transfer agent from removing the restrictive legends on the shares, provided that the Company
posts a bond, which the Company declined to do. On June 13, 2022, the restriction imposed on the shares were lifted. 

Nominal
defendant Transhare Corporation moved to dismiss the defendants counterclaim against it for wrongful refusal to remove restrictions
pursuant to 6 Del. C. 8-401, and its motion was fully submitted in April 2022. On September 9, 2022, the Court granted Transhare
Corporation s motion to dismiss defendants counterclaim for wrongful refusal to remove restrictions. Defendants have appealed
the Court s September 9, 2022 order dismissing defendants counterclaim for wrongful refusal to remove restrictions. On October
3, 2022, the parties submitted a stipulation dismissing defendants outstanding counterclaim against Transhare Corporation seeking
declaratory judgment. 

The
Company participated in a formal mediation with the defendants Lei Zhang and Yan Li on September 18, 2023. As a result of the mediation,
the parties were able to reach a settlement agreement in December 2023. The parties executed a Settlement Agreement on December 21, 2023,
and the claims by each side were formally dismissed by the court on December 22, 2023. The subscription receivable amounted to US 3,024,000
was waived by the Company, and the Company will not retrieve the shares that were issued to the defendants.

1A. RISK FACTORS. 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

On
June 20, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the SPA with certain non-U.S. investors (the
 Purchasers ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, and the Purchasers agreed to purchase, severally and not jointly,
an aggregate of 58,333 shares of common stock of the Company (the Shares at an offering price of US 120.00 per share (the
 Offering ). Each Purchaser represented that he or she is not a resident of the United States and is not a U.S.
person as defined in Rule 902(k) of Regulation S under the Securities Act and is not acquiring the Shares for the account or benefit
of any U.S. person. The Company has received gross proceeds of US 7.0 million from the Purchasers, and all of the Shares were issued
on July 8, 2024. 

The
above-mentioned issuance of securities of the Company is deemed to be exempt under the Securities Act by virtue of Section 4(2) thereof
as the transaction does not involve any public offering. In addition, the issuance was deemed not to fall within Section 5 under the
Securities Act and to be further exempt under Rule 901 and 903 of Regulation S promulgated thereunder by virtue of being the issuance
of securities to non-U.S. citizens or residents, conducted outside the United States and not using any element of interstate commerce.
