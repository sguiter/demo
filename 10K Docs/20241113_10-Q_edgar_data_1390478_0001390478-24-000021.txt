million in upfront payments and certain technology transfer and regulatory milestones. There is a total of million in potential future development, regulatory, and sales milestones, not including future royalties, that remains under the 3D Medicines Agreement, which milestones are all variable in nature and not under the Company's control.

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and restricted cash and cash equivalents of million. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern , the Company evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company expects its cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund its current planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The Company will require substantial additional financing to commercially develop any current or future product candidates. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, it will be required to scale back its plans and place certain activities on hold. The Company currently does not have any commitments to obtain additional funds. The Company's management continues to evaluate different strategies to obtain the required funding for future operations. These strategies may include public and private placements of equity and/or debt securities, as well as payments from potential strategic research and development collaborations or licensing and/or marketing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, the Company continues to pursue discussions with global and regional pharmaceutical companies for licensing and/or co-development rights to the Company's product candidates. There can be no assurance that these future funding efforts will be successful.

 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, pre-funded warrants issued in the August 2024 Registered Direct Offering were exercised for shares of common stock. 
 
 Warrants Classified as Equity 
 
 The warrants to acquire shares of common stock issued during the August 2024 Registered Direct Offering, the March 2024 Registered Direct Offering, and the January 2024 Offering were recorded as equity upon issuance. During its evaluation of equity classification of these warrants, the Company considered the conditions as prescribed within ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging, Contracts in an Entity s own Equity ASC 815-40 ). The conditions within ASC 815-40 are not subject to a probability assessment. The warrants to acquire shares of common stock do not fall under the liability criteria within ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , as they are not puttable and do not represent an instrument that has a redeemable underlying security. The warrants do meet the definition of a derivative instrument under ASC 815 but are eligible for the scope exception as they are indexed to the Company s own stock and would be classified in permanent equity if freestanding. 
 
 In connection with the closing of the January 2024 Offering at a combined offering price of , the Company agreed to (i) reduce the exercise price of an aggregate of warrants that were issued to certain purchasers in an underwritten public offering that closed on April 5, 2022 (the "April 2022 Offering") to , (ii) reduce the exercise price of an aggregate of warrants that were issued in the November 2023 Registered

 , and (iii) extend the termination date of the April 2022 Offering warrants and the November 2023 Registered Direct Offering warrants to January 8, 2029. Concurrent with the closing of the January 2024 Offering, the exercise price of an aggregate of warrants issued in the February 2023 Offering were also reduced to an exercise price of per share. The Company accounted for these amendments as a cost to issue equity with the incremental fair value of approximately million recognized as an offset to the proceeds received. However, there was no net impact to the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity (deficit) because the warrants are equity classified.

 million, and (ii) milestone payments totaling up to million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain technology transfer, development and regulatory milestones, as well as sales milestones based on certain net sales thresholds of GPS Licensed Products in the 3DMed Territory in a given calendar year. 3D Medicines also agreed to pay tiered royalties based upon a percentage of annual net sales of GPS Licensed Products in the 3DMed Territory ranging from the high single digits to the low double digits. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 At inception, the Company evaluated the 3D Medicines Agreement under ASC 606 and recognized an initial transaction price of million, which included the million upfront fee as well as million in development milestones that were assessed to be probable of being achieved, while the remaining milestones were variable consideration subject to constraint at inception. In the first quarter of 2022, an additional million in licensing revenue was recognized upon approval by China s National Medical Products Administration NMPA for a small Phase 1 clinical trial investigating safety of GPS in China. 
 
 There is million in potential future development, regulatory, and sales milestones, not including future royalties, remaining under the 3D Medicines Agreement as of September 30, 2024, which milestones are variable in nature and not under the Company's control. At the end of each reporting period, the Company reevaluates the probability of achievement of the future development, regulatory, and sales milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, will adjust its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments will be recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. 
 
 For the sales-based royalties, the Company will recognize revenue when the related sales occur. To date, the Company has not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of its licensing arrangements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 This management s discussion and analysis of financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on March 28, 2024, or our 2023 Annual Report, and our other public reports filed with the SEC. 

Overview 
 
 We are a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutics for a broad range of cancer indications. Our product candidates currently include galinpepimut-S, or GPS, a peptide immunotherapy directed against the Wilms tumor 1, or WT1, antigen, and SLS009 (formerly GFH009), a highly selective small molecule cyclin-dependent kinase 9, or CDK9, inhibitor. 
 
 Galinpepimut-S, or GPS: Highly Novel and Engineered Immunotherapy Targeting the WT1 Antigen 
 
 Our lead product candidate, GPS, is a cancer immunotherapeutic agent licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or MSK, that targets the WT1 protein, which is present in 20 or more cancer types. Based on its mechanism of action as a directly immunizing agent, GPS has potential as a monotherapy or in combination with other immunotherapeutic agents to address a broad spectrum of hematologic, or blood, cancers and solid tumor indications. 
 
 In January 2020, we commenced in the United States an open label randomized Phase 3 clinical trial, the REGAL study, for GPS monotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, in the maintenance setting after achievement of second complete remission, or CR2, following successful completion of second-line antileukemic therapy. Patients are randomized to receive either GPS or best available treatment, or BAT. We expect this study will be used as the basis for submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, subject to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful data outcome and agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. The primary endpoint of the REGAL study is overall survival. We planned to enroll approximately 125 to 140 patients at approximately 95 clinical sites in North America, Europe and Asia with a planned interim safety, efficacy and futility analysis after 60 events (deaths) and final analysis after 80 events. In March 2024, we announced the completion of enrollment. In June 2024, we announced the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, conducted a prespecified risk-benefit assessment of unblinded data from the study and recommended that the trial continue without modifications. Based on a detailed analysis of all unblinded data, the IDMC projects with a high level of confidence that the interim analysis (60 events) will occur by the fourth quarter of 2024. Because these analyses are event driven, they are difficult to predict with any certainty and may occur at a different time than currently expected. 
 
 In December 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or 3D Medicines Agreement, with 3D Medicines Inc., or 3D Medicines, a China-based biopharmaceutical company developing next-generation immuno-oncology drugs, for the development and commercialization of GPS, as well as the Company s next generation heptavalent immunotherapeutic GPS+, which is at preclinical stage, across all therapeutic and diagnostic uses in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, which we collectively refer to as Greater China, or the 3DMed Territory. We have retained sole rights to GPS and GPS+ outside of Greater China. In November 2022, we announced that we had agreed with 3D Medicines for 3D Medicines to participate in the REGAL study through the inclusion of approximately 20 patients from mainland China. In December 2022, we entered into a Side Letter Agreement with 3D Medicines, or Side Letter, which, together with the 3D Medicines Agreement, details the terms and conditions of 3D Medicines' participation in the REGAL study. Although the REGAL study has completed enrollment as announced in March 2024, in accordance with the predetermined statistical analysis plan, 3D Medicines may still enroll patients in mainland China. The timing of such participation and patient enrollment by 3D Medicines, if at all, cannot be predicted with certainty. As of September 30, 2024, we have received an aggregate of 10.5 million in upfront and milestone payments under the 3D Medicines Agreement and a total of 191.5 million in potential future development, regulatory and sales milestones, not including future royalties, remains under the license agreement, which milestones are variable in nature and not under our control. In December 2023, we 
 19 

commenced an arbitration proceeding against 3D Medicines regarding, among other things, the trigger and payment of 13.0 million in milestone payments due to us. See Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings . 
 
 GPS was granted Orphan Drug Product Designations, or ODD, from the FDA, as well as orphan medicines designations from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for GPS in AML, MPM, and multiple myeloma, or MM, as well as Fast Track designation for AML, MPM, and MM from the FDA. In October 2024, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease, or RPD, designation to GPS for the treatment of pediatric AML. 
 
 SLS009: Highly Selective Next Generation CDK9 Inhibitor 
 
 On March 31, 2022, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the GenFleet Agreement, with GenFleet Therapeutics (Shanghai), Inc., or GenFleet, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cutting-edge therapeutics in oncology and immunology, that grants rights to us for the development and commercialization of SLS009, a highly selective small molecule CDK9 inhibitor, across all therapeutic and diagnostic uses worldwide, except for Greater China. 
 
 CDK9 activity has been shown to correlate negatively with overall survival in a number of cancer types, including hematologic cancers, such as AML and lymphomas, as well as solid cancers, such as osteosarcoma, pediatric soft tissue sarcomas, melanoma, endometrial, lung, prostate, breast and ovarian. As demonstrated in preclinical and clinical data, to date, SLS009 s high selectivity has the potential to reduce toxicity as compared to older CDK9 inhibitors and other next-generation CDK9 inhibitors currently in clinical development and to potentially be more efficacious. 
 
 We completed a Phase 1 dose-escalating clinical trial in the United States and China for SLS009 in mid-2023 and reported positive safety and efficacy data for both patient cohorts, that is relapsed and/or refractory AML and refractory lymphoma. We also established in the trial a recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, of 60 mg once weekly for AML and 100 mg once weekly for lymphomas. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2023, we commenced an open label, single arm, multi-center Phase 2a clinical trial with SLS009 in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine, or aza/ven, in patients with AML who failed or did not respond to treatment with venetoclax-based therapies. The trial is evaluating safety, tolerability, and efficacy at two dose levels of SLS009, 45 mg once weekly, and 60 mg once weekly or 30 mg twice a week, in combination with aza/ven. In addition to safety and tolerability of SLS009 in combination with aza/ven, the efficacy endpoints are complete response composite rate and duration of response. Additional endpoints include event free survival, overall survival, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments. 
 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed enrollment in the 45 mg (safety) dose cohort in the Phase 2a study and reported positive initial topline data. At that time, we also commenced enrollment in the 60 mg dose cohort with patients randomized to one of two groups, 60 mg fixed dose once weekly or 30 mg fixed twice weekly. Each group was planned to enroll five to 10 patients. 
 
 In March 2024, we announced positive topline data from the Phase 2a clinical trial of SLS009 in combination with aza/ven in r/r/ AML. A total of 21 patients were enrolled in the study as of March 15, 2024: 10 in the 45 mg safety cohort and 11 in the 60 mg cohort (30 mg twice a week or 60 mg once a week). Response rates observed in the three cohorts were 10 in the 45 mg once a week safety dose cohort (dose level below the RP2D), 20 in the 60 mg once a week dose cohort, and 50 in the 30 mg twice a week dose cohort. Additionally, we observed strong anti-leukemic activity, which is defined as 50 or more bone marrow blast reduction in 67 of patients across all dose levels. At the time of data cutoff, median OS had not been reached in any of the cohorts and the first patient enrolled in the study who achieved a CR continued on the study and remained leukemia-free 9 months after enrollment. 

20 

During the trial, we identified potential biomarkers currently undergoing testing as predictive markers in the most recent portion of the study. In May 2024, we announced additional preliminary data from the Phase 2a trial of SLS009 in r/r AML and successful filing of a provisional patent application around the ASXL1 mutation and SLS009, including all CDK9 inhibitor drugs. ASXL1 mutations are associated with poor prognosis in all myeloid diseases, owing to the reduced response to the current treatment options. We observed a high rate of responses in patients with myelodysplasia-related molecular mutations, as defined by the World Health Organization, and patients with the ASXL1 gene mutation accounted for the most responders across all dose cohorts. As of April 19, 2024, a 100 response rate had been achieved in r/r AML patients with ASXL1 truncating mutations at the optimal dose level (30 mg twice a week), and a 57 response rate in r/r AML patients with ASXL1 truncating mutations across all dose levels. Furthermore, we have clarified the proposed biological basis and mechanism of action for SLS009 activity in patients with these biomarkers. The relevant biomarkers are present in multiple hematologic and solid cancer indications, with a substantial proportion of patients exhibiting them in additional indications, ranging up to ~50 of patients in some indications. We also announced that we have expanded the ongoing study to include two additional cohorts, one with ASXL1 mutated AML patients and one with patients with myelodysplasia-related molecular abnormalities other than ASXL1. 
 
 In June 2024, we announced the completion of enrollment and additional positive data in the Phase 2a clinical trial of SLS009 in r/r AML. SLS009 was generally well-tolerated with no safety issues observed across all dose levels and there were no dose-limiting or high-grade-treatment-related non-hematological malignancies. The hematological malignancy profile was not different from that of venetoclax-based regimens alone. As of the May 25, 2024 data cutoff date, there were 27 patients with at least one efficacy assessment and were considered evaluable for efficacy. The overall response rate (ORR: response defined as leukemia-free status that includes complete response, complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery, and morphologic leukemia-free state) among evaluable patients: 
 
 50 (4 out of 8 patients) in the 30 mg BIW cohort 
 33 (3 out of 9 patients) in the 60 mg QW cohort 
 10 (1 out of 10 patients) in the 45 mg QW safety cohort 
 29.6 across all dose levels 
 
 The data in June 2024 was consistent with the data previously announced in May 2024, and the highest response rates were observed among patients harboring ASXL1 mutations. Notably, responses were highly correlated with mutational status, with 6 out of 8 responding patients having myelodysplasia-related somatic mutations and 5 having specifically ASXL1 mutations. A 100 overall response rate was achieved in evaluable patients with ASXL1 mutations in the 30 mg BIW cohort. Median overall survival was not reached in the 30 mg BIW and 60 mg QW cohorts. Median overall survival in the 45 mg QW safety cohort was 5.4 months. Observed efficacy outcomes exceeded the targeted ORR of 20 and targeted median overall survival of 3 months. 
 
 In November 2024, we announced that data from the Phase 2a trial of SLS009 in r/r AML will be presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting Exposition in December 2024. 
 
 Our partner, GenFleet, is focusing on lymphoma indications with SLS009 in its Greater China market. In March 2024, GenFleet announced that it entered into a collaboration and supply agreement with BeiGene Switzerland GmbH to initiate a study of SLS009 in combination with Zanubrutinib (Brukinsa ), a BTK inhibitor, in r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, and the first patient was dosed in the trial. The study is funded and sponsored by GenFleet and is being conducted in China only. 
 
 SLS009 is also currently being evaluated in pediatric solid tumors and leukemia models through the NCI Pediatric Preclinical in Vivo Testing, or PIVOT, program. Studies are supported through cooperative agreement grants from the NCI to the PIVOT research centers performing the testing in pediatric tumor models and a centralized coordinating center. We expect to report relevant data from the program in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 For SLS009, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Product designations in AML and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, and Fast Track designations for r/r AML and r/r PTCL. The FDA granted RPD designation to SLS009 for the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, in June 2024 and the FDA granted RPD designation to SLS009 for the treatment of pediatric AML in July 2024. Also, the European Medicines Agency granted Orphan Drug Designation for SLS009 in AML and in PTCL in June 2024 and July 2024, respectively.

Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include: 
 
 expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials; 
 
 manufacturing and clinical drug supply expenses; 
 
 outsourced professional scientific development services; 
 
 employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; 
 
 payments made under our license agreements, under which we acquired certain intellectual property; 
 
 expenses relating to certain regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies; 
 
 laboratory materials and supplies used to support our research activities; and 
 
 allocated expenses, utilities, and other facility-related costs. 
 
 The successful development of our current and future product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from, any current or future product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of our clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including: 
 
 the number and geographical location of clinical sites included in the trials; 
 
 the length of time required to enroll suitable patients; 
 
 the number and geographical location of patients that ultimately participate in the trials; 
 
 the number of doses patients receive; 
 
 the duration of patient follow-up; 
 
 the results of clinical trials; 
 
 the expenses associated with manufacturing and clinical drug supply; 
 
 the receipt of marketing approvals; and 
 
 the commercialization of current and future product candidates. 
 
 Research and development activities are central to our business model. Oncology product candidates in the later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in the earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of the later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we conduct and complete our ongoing early and late-stage clinical trials and initiate additional clinical trials. 
 
 22 

Our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our current or future product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or target indications or focus on others. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, administrative, finance and legal functions, including stock-based compensation, travel expenses and recruiting expenses, fees for outside legal counsel, amortization of contract acquisition costs (commissions), and director and officer insurance premiums. Other general and administrative expenses include facility related costs, patent filing and prosecution costs, professional fees for business development, accounting, consulting, legal and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with our Nasdaq listing and SEC reporting requirements, investor relations costs, and other expenses associated with being a public company. 
 
 If and when we believe that regulatory approval of a product candidate appears likely, we anticipate that an increase in general and administrative expenses will occur as a result of our preparation for commercial operations, particularly as it relates to the sales and marketing of such product candidate. Oncology product commercialization may take several years and millions of dollars in development costs. 
 
 Non-Operating Income 
 
 Non-operating income consists of changes in fair value of our warrant liability, and interest income. Interest income primarily reflects interest earned from our cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 In the 2023 Annual Report, we disclosed our critical accounting policies and estimates upon which our consolidated financial statements are derived. There have been no material changes to these policies and estimates since December 31, 2023 that are not included in Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Readers are encouraged to read the 2023 Annual Report in conjunction with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Further analysis of the changes and trends in our operating results are discussed below. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expenses were 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.4 million decrease was primarily attributable to a 0.7 million decrease of clinical drug supply purchases and a 0.4 million decrease in clinical trial related expenses primarily driven by the completion of enrollment in the REGAL study in the first quarter of 2024, as well as a 0.2 million decrease in clinical and regulatory consultants and a 0.1 million decrease in personnel related expenses due to a decrease in headcount. We anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase in the future as we continue to advance the development of GPS and SLS009. 
 
 Research and development expenses were 14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 4.2 million decrease was primarily attributable to a 1.7 million decrease in clinical and regulatory consultants, a 1.5 million decrease of clinical drug supply purchases driven by the completion of enrollment in the REGAL study in the first quarter of 2024, a 0.6 million decrease in personnel related expenses due to a decrease in headcount, a 0.3 million decrease in clinical trial related expenses driven by the completion of enrollment in REGAL, and a 0.1 million decrease in licensing fees. We anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase in the future as we continue to advance the development of GPS and SLS009. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses were 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.5 million decrease was primarily 
 24 

attributable to a 0.6 million decrease in personnel related expenses due to a decrease in headcount, including a 0.2 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation, and a 0.1 million decrease related to insurance premiums, which were partially offset by a 0.2 million increase in legal fees. 
 
 General and administrative expenses were 9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.9 million decrease was primarily attributable to a 1.3 million decrease in personnel related expenses due to a decrease in headcount, including a 0.4 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation, a 0.5 million decrease in outside services and public company costs, and a 0.5 million decrease related to insurance premiums, which were partially offset by the initial recognition of a 1.1 million one-time severance charge during the current period and a 0.3 million increase in legal fees. 
 
 Non-Operating Income 
 
 Non-operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Change in fair value of warrant liability 4 (4) Interest income 221 94 127 451 484 (33) Total non-operating income 221 94 127 451 488 (37) 
 
 Non-operating income of 0.2 million and 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.5 million during each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was primarily related to interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We did not generate any revenue from product sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Through September 30, 2024, we have only generated licensing revenue from the 3DMed License Agreement. Since inception, we have incurred net losses, used net cash in our operations, and have funded substantially all of our operations through proceeds of the sale of equity securities and convertible notes. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 On August 1, 2024, we consummated a registered direct offering with an institutional investor priced at a premium to market, or the August 2024 Registered Direct Offering, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell 6,370,070 shares of common stock and 9,478,986 pre-funded warrants exercisable for shares of common stock, together with accompanying warrants to purchase 15,849,056 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock and accompanying common warrant were sold together at a combined offering price of 1.325, and each pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrant were sold together at a combined offering price of 1.3249. The common warrants have an exercise price of 1.20 per share. The net proceeds to us from the August 2024 Registered Direct Offering were approximately 19.5 million, after deducting the placement agent's fees and related offering expenses. 
 
 On March 19, 2024, we consummated a registered direct offering with two institutional investors priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules, or the March 2024 Registered Direct Offering, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell 11,000,000 shares of its common stock and 2,029,316 pre-funded warrants exercisable for shares of common stock. Each share of common stock was sold at a purchase price of 1.535 and each pre-funded warrant was sold at a purchase price of 1.5349. The net proceeds to us from the March 2024 Registered Direct Offering were approximately 18.5 million, after deducting the placement agent's fees and related offering expenses. In a concurrent private placement, we agreed to issue to the two institutional investors exercisable for up to an aggregate of 13,029,316 shares of common stock warrants at an exercise price of 1.41 per share. Subsequent to the closing of the March 2024 Registered Direct Offering, all of the pre-funded warrants have been exercised for shares of common stock. 
 
 25 

On January 8, 2024, we consummated a public offering on a "reasonable best efforts" basis, or the January 2024 Offering, issuing 10,130,000 shares of common stock and an aggregate of 1,870,000 pre-funded warrants exercisable for shares of common stock, together with accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate of 12,000,000 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock and accompanying common warrant were sold together at a combined offering price of 0.75, and each pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrant were sold together at a combined offering price of 0.7499. The net proceeds to us from the January 2024 Offering were approximately 8.2 million, after deducting the placement agent's fees and related offering expenses. Subsequent to the closing of the January 2024 Offering, all of the pre-funded warrants have been exercised for shares of common stock. 
 
 In December 2020, together with our wholly-owned subsidiary, SLSG Limited, LLC, we entered into the 3D Medicines Agreement pursuant to which we granted 3D Medicines a sublicensable royalty-bearing license under certain intellectual property owned or controlled by us, to develop, manufacture and have manufactured, and commercialize GPS and heptavalent GPS product candidates for all therapeutic and other diagnostic uses in the 3DMed Territory. To date, we have received 10.5 million in upfront payments and certain technology transfer and regulatory milestones. A total of 191.5 million in potential future development, regulatory, and sales milestones, not including future royalties, remains under the 3D Medicines Agreement as of September 30, 2024, which milestones are all variable in nature and not under our control. In December 2023, we commenced a binding arbitration proceeding against 3D Medicines, which involves, among other things, the trigger and payment of certain milestone payments due to us. See Part II, Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. 
 
 Funding Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 241.4 million, cash and cash equivalents of 21.0 million and restricted cash and cash equivalents of 0.1 million. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our current planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. These conditions give rise to a substantial doubt over our ability to continue as a going concern. This going concern assumption is based on management s assessment of the sufficiency of our current and future sources of liquidity and whether it is probable we will be able to meet our obligations as they become due for at least one year from the date our consolidated financial statements are available to be issued, and if not, whether our liquidation is imminent. 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We anticipate incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that we can generate significant sales of any current or future product candidates in development. 
 
 We will require substantial additional financing to develop any current or future product candidates. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we will be required to scale back our plans and place certain activities on hold. We currently do not have any commitments to obtain additional funds. Our management continues to evaluate different strategies to obtain the required funding for future operations. These strategies may include public and private placements of equity and/or debt securities, as well as payments from potential strategic research and development collaborations or licensing and/or marketing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, we continue to pursue discussions with global and regional pharmaceutical companies for licensing and/or co-development rights to our product candidates. There can be no assurance that these future funding efforts will be successful. 
 
 Our future operations are highly dependent on a combination of factors, including (i) the timely and successful completion of any additional financings, (ii) our ability to complete revenue-generating partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, (iii) the success of our research and development activities, (iv) the development of competitive therapies by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and, ultimately, (v) regulatory approval and market acceptance of our product candidates. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

 Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer (the Certifying Officers ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Certifying Officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on these evaluations, the Certifying Officers have concluded, that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q: 
 
 (a) our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and 
 
 (b) our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act was accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Certifying Officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 In December 2020, we entered into the 3D Medicines Agreement. In November 2022, we announced that we had agreed with 3D Medicines for 3D Medicines to participate in the REGAL study through the inclusion of approximately 20 patients from mainland China. 
 
 In accordance with the terms of the 3D Medicines Agreement and the Side Letter, we had expected that 3D Medicines would begin enrolling patients in mainland China in the REGAL study in the second half of 2023 and subsequently make two development milestone payments totaling 13.0 million. Patients were enrolled in the REGAL study in Taiwan, which is part of the 3DMed Territory, prior to the second half of 2023. 
 
 On December 20, 2023, we commenced a binding arbitration proceeding against 3D Medicines, administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre and governed by New York State law as per the 3D Medicines Agreement. The arbitration proceeding involves, among other things, the trigger and payment of the relevant milestone payments due to us as well as 3D Medicines failure to use commercially reasonable best efforts to develop GPS in the 3DMed Territory, and particularly in mainland China. 
 
 We have engaged an international law firm with expertise in mainland China to assist us with the arbitration proceeding. While we are unable at this time to predict with certainty the outcome of the arbitration proceeding, or the timing of the receipt of any milestone payments and other damages it is seeking in the arbitration proceeding, if at all, we believe that our claims are meritorious. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Please refer to our note on forward-looking statements on page 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated into this item by reference. 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in our 2023 Annual Report. The risks described in such 2023 Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 
 None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 Not applicable.
