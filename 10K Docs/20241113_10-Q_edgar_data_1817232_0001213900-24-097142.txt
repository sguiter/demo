and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing by (B) per share and (ii) a number of Holdings Common Units equal
to the number of shares of Class B Common Stock received by such Seller pursuant to clause (i) hereof. 

The
Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, although
Dune acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Global Hydrogen in the Business Combination, Dune was treated as the acquired 
company and Global Hydrogen was treated as the accounting acquirer for financial statement reporting purposes. Accordingly, the Business
Combination was treated as the equivalent of Global Hydrogen issuing stock for the net assets of Dune, accompanied by a recapitalization.
The net assets of Dune were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the
Business Combination were those of Global Hydrogen. See Note 4, Recapitalization. 

In
connection with the Business Combination, on December 1, 2023, Dune and Global Hydrogen entered into a forward purchase agreement
(the Forward Purchase Agreement with each of Meteora Strategic Capital, LLC MSC ), Meteora Capital Partners,
LP MCP and Meteora Select Trading Opportunities Master, LP MSTO and, collectively with MSC and MCP, the
 Meteora Entities for an OTC Equity Prepaid Forward Transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement,
on the Closing Date, the Sellers purchased shares of Dune Class A Common Stock (the Recycled Shares directly from the redeeming stockholders of Dune. Also on the Closing Date, the Company paid to the Sellers a prepayment amount of million
required under the Forward Purchase Agreement directly from the trust account and transferred to the Sellers shares
of Dune Class A Common Stock (the Share Consideration ). See Note 7, Stockholders Equity for more details
about the Forward Purchase Agreement. 

In
connection with the Forward Purchase Agreement, Dune entered into a subscription agreement (the Subscription Agreement with the Meteora Entities. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the Meteora Entities agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and Dune
agreed to issue and sell to the Meteora Entities, on the Closing Date, shares of Class A Common Stock in the aggregate
(the PIPE Shares ). Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the Company gave certain registration rights to the Meteora
Entities with respect to the PIPE Shares. The sale of the PIPE Shares was consummated concurrently with the Closing. 

On
March 4, 2024, Global Gas entered into forfeiture agreements (the Forfeiture Agreements with each of Sergio Martinez,
Barbara Guay Martinez and William Bennett Nance, Jr., pursuant to which such individuals forfeited an aggregate of shares
of Class B Common Stock (collectively, the Forfeitures ). After the Forfeitures, the Sellers continue to hold an aggregate
of shares of Class B Common Stock. 

The
rights of holders of our Class A Common Stock and Warrants are governed by our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation
(the Amended and Restated Charter ), our amended and restated bylaws (the Amended and Restated Bylaws and
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL ), and in the case of the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants,

in cash and cash equivalents, a working capital deficit of , and an accumulated deficit of 
as of September 30, 2024. 

As disclosed in
Note 1, as a result of the Company s failure to satisfy the initial listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market in accordance
with Nasdaq Rule 5101-2 as it relates to the Company s compliance with the Stockholders Equity, Publicly Held Shares, Market Value
of Listed Securities and Market Value of Publicly Held Shares requirements set forth in Nasdaq Rule 5505, on June 21, 2024, the Company
received notice that the Panel had determined to delist the Company s securities from Nasdaq and would suspend trading in its securities
on the exchange effective at the open of business on June 25, 2024. Since the delisting, the Company s common stock and warrants
have been trading on the OTC market. 

The
Company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the Company s revenue growth rate, the timing
and extent of spending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts. In order to finance these opportunities,
the Company will need to raise additional financing. While there can be no assurances, the Company intends to raise such capital through
issuances of additional equity. If additional financing is required from outside sources, the Company may not be able to raise it on
terms acceptable to the Company or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when desired, the Company s business,
results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. 

As
a result of the above, in connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standard Board s FASB ASC Subtopic 205-40, Going Concern, management has determined that
the Company s liquidity condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through
twelve months from the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. These unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification
of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

by eliminating the 180-day period following a Trade Date before Seller may commence selling Recycled Shares and by permitting such sales
without payment by Seller of any Early Termination Obligation until such time as the proceeds from such sales equal (instead of
 as originally provided in the Forward Purchase Agreement) of the Prepayment Shortfall. Finally, the Amendment amends the section
of the Forward Purchase Agreement regarding Share Consideration by amending the holding period to equal the earlier of (i) Seller recovering
 of the first Additional Shortfall Request and (ii) the three-month anniversary of the Business Combination (as defined in the Forward
Purchase Agreement) (instead of just a three-month holding period).

market Recycled Shares prior to the closing of the Business Combination. Seller shall not be required to purchase an
amount of Dune Class A Common Stock such that following such purchase, the Seller s ownership would exceed of the total Dune
Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such purchase, unless Seller, at its sole discretion, waives such
 ownership limitation. The Number of Shares subject to the Forward Purchase Agreement is subject to reduction following a termination
of the Forward Purchase Agreement with respect to such shares of Dune Class A Common Stock as described under Optional Early Termination 
in the Forward Purchase Agreement. Seller intended to purchase Dune Class A Common Stock pursuant to its FPA Funding Amount PIPE Subscription
Agreement (as defined below) and from third parties (other than Counterparty) through a broker in the open market (other than through
Counterparty).

the Trust Account are disbursed in connection with the Business Combination, except that to the extent the Prepayment Amount payable
to a Seller is to be paid from the purchase of Additional Shares by such Seller pursuant to the terms of its FPA Funding Amount PIPE
Subscription Agreement, such amount will be netted against such proceeds, with such Seller being able to reduce the purchase price for
the Additional Shares by the Prepayment Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, any Additional Shares purchased by a Seller will be included
in the Number of Shares for its respective Forward Purchase Agreement for all purposes, including for determining the Prepayment Amount. 

In
addition to the Prepayment Amount, the Counterparty will pay directly from the Trust Account, on the Prepayment Date, an amount equal
to the product of (x) up to (with such final amount to be determined by Seller in its sole discretion via written notice to Counterparty)

modified to equal such reduced price as of such date (subject to certain customary exceptions). 

From
time to time and on any date following the Trade Date (any such date, an OET Date ), Seller may, in its absolute discretion,

Shortfall Sales (which designation can be made only up to the amount of Shortfall Sale proceeds), any Share Consideration sales or any
other Shares, whether or not sold, which shares will not be included in any OET Notice when calculating the number of Terminated Shares.
The effect of an OET Notice shall be to reduce the Number of Shares by the number of Terminated Shares specified in such OET Notice with
effect as of the related OET Date. As of each OET Date, the Counterparty shall be entitled to an amount from the Seller, and the Seller
shall pay to the Counterparty an amount, equal to the product of (x) the number of Terminated Shares and (y) the Reset Price in respect

activity in connection with such agreement has been undertaken, to comply with the requirements of all tender offer regulations applicable
to the Business Combination, including Rule 14e-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Seller cannot tender any shares

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The following Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023
and period from February 8, 2023 to September 30, 2023, our audited consolidated financial statements as of the year ended December 31,
2023, and other information included elsewhere in this report. This discussion includes forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act ). We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future
events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause
our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements
by terminology such as may, should, could, would, expect, plan, 
 anticipate, believe, estimate, continue, or the negative of such terms or other
similar expressions. Such statements include, but are not limited to, possible business combinations and the financing thereof, and related
matters, as well as all other statements other than statements of historical fact included herein. Factors that might cause or contribute
to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings. 

Unless the context otherwise
requires, references in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
to we, us, our and the Company generally refer to Global Hydrogen in in the present
tense or Global Gas from and after the Business Combination. 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This report contains certain
 forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the PSLRA ).
Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as anticipate, believe, continue, 
 could, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, 
 possible, potential, predict, project, should, would, 
 will, shall, seek, result, become, target or other
similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters, but the absence
of these words does not mean a statement is not forward looking. Indications of, and guidance or outlook on, future earnings, dividends
or financial position or performance are also forward looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited
to: (1) references with respect to the anticipated benefits of the proposed Business Combination and anticipated closing timing;
(2) the anticipated capitalization and enterprise value of the combined company following the consummation of the proposed Business
Combination; (3) current and future potential commercial and customer relationships; and (4) anticipated demand for Global Gas 
product and service offerings. 

These forward-looking statements
involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially, and potentially adversely, from
those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements
about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Most
of these factors are outside the Company s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include,
but are not limited to: (i) risks relating to the uncertainty of the projected financial information with respect to Global Hydrogen;
(ii) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination, which may be affected by, among other things,
competition, the ability of Global Hydrogen to grow and manage growth profitably, sell and expand its product and service offerings, implement
its growth strategy and retain its key employees; (iii) risks relating to Global Hydrogen s operations and business, including
the combined company s ability to raise financing, hire employees, secure supplier, customer and other commercial contracts, obtain
licenses and information technology and protect itself against cybersecurity risks; (iv) intense competition and competitive pressures
from other companies worldwide in the industries in which the combined company will operate; (v) litigation and the ability to adequately
protect the combined company s intellectual property rights; (vi) costs related to the Business Combination; (vii) changes
in applicable laws or regulations; and (viii) the possibility that Global Hydrogen may be adversely affected by other economic, business
and/or competitive factors. 

These forward-looking statements
should not be relied upon as representing the Company s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this report. Accordingly,
undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.

Global Gas Corporation is
a nascent pure-play hydrogen and carbon recovery project developer and industrial gas supplier that has commenced initial operations and
is building a growing project development pipeline. Potential projects are added to the project development pipeline only after Global
Hydrogen has met with the potential customer, discussed the scope of the project and discussed the project s feasibility, preliminary
sizing and design. Since its inception, Global Hydrogen has worked to establish relationships in the form of channel checks with non-exclusive
independent equipment suppliers and discussions with vendors, but the Company has not yet generated any revenue or reached final terms
with any paying customers or suppliers. As we expand our operations, we intend to offer potential customers reliable, low-carbon and clean
hydrogen, pure carbon dioxide, and other gases generated from a variety of feedstocks. We intend for our operations to include (i) the
sourcing, identification, evaluation and vetting of offtake customers seeking to purchase industrial gases, (ii) the securing of
local feedstocks, equipment, and utilities, (iii) the planning and management of projects and (iv) the structuring and financing
of our projects. We intend to offer our customers attractive pricing as we select and secure local, often waste, feedstock, and plan to
deploy established industrial gas generation, storage, compression, and dispensing technologies in our projects. On each planned project,
we seek to sell multiple gas products, sourced from a single feedstock, for offtake to customers. We also intend to utilize and bring
to market secondary offtake products such as oxygen. Global Hydrogen is currently a minority-owned business and we are targeting both
privately- and publicly-funded hydrogen development and selected carbon recovery projects, including projects supported by local, county,
state, and national-level governments in North America, Western Europe, and Great Britain. 

In selecting feedstock to
generate industrial gases, we will primarily target renewable waste and will need to seek arrangements with owners of renewable waste
feedstock, such as wastewater treatment plants, landfills, food waste processing facilities, and agricultural farms, to access their renewable
waste feedstock. In addition to generating industrial gases from renewable waste feedstock, we plan to generate gases from non-renewable
sources including pipeline natural gas. We will need to seek arrangement with owners of such non-renewable feedstock. On projects where
a non-renewable, or high greenhouse gas output, energy source is used, as well as on selected other projects where such technology is
required to produce clean hydrogen, we may deploy carbon recovery technology more commonly known as carbon capture technology. 

On the hydrogen side, we
serve traditional industrial gas customers, and are particularly focused on plans to serve the rapidly growing hydrogen-as-energy-carrier
market, comprising heavy duty hauling transportation operators such as transit bus agencies, long haul truck fleet operators, truck leasing
operators, and refuse collection truck operators, many of whom are considering deploying hydrogen fuel cell powertrain vehicles to decarbonize
their fleets which currently runs almost exclusively on diesel. On the carbon dioxide side, we target both traditional industrial users
of the gas, including food beverage grade users such as brewers and beverage bottlers requiring carbonation, as well as emerging
users such as the producers of green building materials. 

Our growth strategy is based
on developing our ability to place modular generation, recovery, storage, and dispensing solutions in closer geographic proximity to our
end customers onsite in many cases and our ability to produce and sell multiple outputs from a single
feedstock input. We hope that these plans, if successfully carried out, will allow us to produce clean hydrogen and carbon dioxide at
a net cost normally seen only in larger scale plants and which supports competitive market prices for our end products. Additionally,
governments at all levels in North America and Western Europe have and are deploying substantial incentives to mitigate the impact of
climate change and to decarbonize their economies. We believe we are well-placed to benefit as a developer of projects eligible for several
of these incentives, such as the hydrogen tax production credits and the investment tax credits made available in the United States
through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. 

Global Gas has not yet
generated any revenue and does not anticipate generating revenue from the sale of systems and equipment to customers in 2024.
Global Hydrogen management actively reviews its project development pipeline and activity with potential customers. Potential
projects are added to the project development pipeline only after Global Hydrogen has met with the potential customer, discussed the
scope of the project and discussed the project s feasibility, preliminary sizing and design. Management has determined that
its projections are reasonable based on its review and status of its potential projects. Global Hydrogen has not yet successfully
closed on any project. 

Global Hydrogen is headquartered
in New York, New York and its corporate website is globalhydrogen.co. Global Hydrogen s website and the information contained
on, or that can be accessed through, such website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this
proxy statement. 

20 

While Global Hydrogen does
not have significant past operating history, Global Hydrogen s management is aware that the future operating results and future
financial condition of Global Hydrogen may be different than our past operating results and financial condition. Major factors that will
have a material impact on future financial results and condition include whether Global Hydrogen will be able to sign contracts with customers
and suppliers necessary to undertake the business plan. Even if such contracts are signed, our business plan is complex and there are
many factors which could impact our operating results and financial condition including delays in projects, volatility in the price of
our raw materials and products, and volatility in the demand for our services and products. 

Recent Developments 

Recent events impacting our business are as follows: 

Business Combination 

On May 14, 2023, the Company,
entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement ), by and among Global Gas Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Dune Holdings ), Dune Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation Dune ). 

In accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, at the closing of the Business Combination (the Closing ), (a) Dune
will contribute to Holdings all of its assets (excluding its interests in Holdings and the aggregate amount of cash proceeds required
to satisfy any redemptions by Dune s public stockholders Dune Stockholder Redemptions )), and in exchange therefore,
Holdings will issue to Dune a number of common equity units of Holdings Holdings Common Units which will equal the number
of total shares of Dune s Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share Dune Class A Common Stock ), issued and
outstanding immediately after the Closing (taking into account any equity financing agreements entered into by Dune between the signing
date of the Purchase Agreement and the Closing and giving effect to all Dune Stockholder Redemptions) (such transactions, the SPAC
Contribution and (b) immediately after the SPAC Contribution, the members of the Company will transfer, convey, assign and deliver
all of the limited liability company equity interests of the Company Company Units to Holdings in exchange for shares
of Dune s Class B voting non-economic common stock, par value 0.0001 per share Dune Class B Common Stock and, together
with Dune Class A Common Stock, Dune Common Stock ), and Holdings Common Units (together with the SPAC Contribution, the
 Combination Transactions ), as a result of which, (i) each issued and outstanding Company Unit immediately prior to the Combination
Transactions will be held by Holdings, (ii) each Seller will receive an aggregate number of Holdings Common Units and shares of Dune Class
B Common Stock equal to the number of Company Units held by such Seller, multiplied by the Company Exchange Ratio (as defined below),
and (iii) Dune will change its name to Global Gas Corporation New Global Hydrogen and New Global Hydrogen will be the
publicly traded reporting company in an Up-C Structure (clauses (i) through (iii) collectively, and together with the Combination
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, being referred to collectively hereafter as the Transactions ). 

On December 21, 2023 (the
 Closing ), the Business Combination was consummated. In connection with the closing of such Business Combination, the Company
changed its name to Global Gas Corporation, and on December 22, 2023, the Company s Class A Common Stock (as defined below) and
warrants began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq under the new trading symbols of HGAS and HGASW, 
respectively. 

In accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby (the Business Combination ),
at the closing of the Business Combination on December 21, 2023, (a) Dune contributed to Holdings all of its assets (excluding its interests
in Holdings and the aggregate amount of cash proceeds required to satisfy redemptions by Dune s public stockholders Stockholder
Redemptions )), and in exchange therefore, Holdings issued to Dune a number of common equity units of Holdings Holdings
Common Units which equal the number of total shares of Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share Class A Common
Stock ), of Dune issued and outstanding immediately after the Closing (giving effect to all Stockholder Redemptions) (such transactions,
the SPAC Contribution and (b) immediately after the SPAC Contribution, the Sellers transferred, conveyed, assigned and
delivered all of the limited liability company equity interests of Global Hydrogen Global Hydrogen Units to Holdings in
exchange for shares of Class B voting non-economic common stock, par value 0.0001 per share Class B Common Stock ), of
Dune and Holdings Common Units (together with the SPAC Contribution, the Combination Transactions ), as a result of which,
(i) each issued and outstanding Global Hydrogen Unit immediately prior to the Combination Transactions is now held by Holdings, (ii) each
Seller received an aggregate number of Holdings Common Units and shares of Class B Common Stock, in each case, equal to the number of
Global Hydrogen Units held by such Seller, multiplied by the applicable exchange ratio, and (iii) Dune changed its name to Global Gas
Corporation and the Company became the publicly traded reporting company. The effective time of the Business Combination on the Closing
Date is referred to as the Effective Time. 

21 

The Business Combination
was accomplished through what is commonly referred to as an Up-C structure, which is often used by partnerships and limited
liability companies undertaking an initial public offering. The Up-C structure allowed the Sellers, who became equity holders
of Holdings upon the consummation of the Combination Transactions, to retain their equity ownership in Holdings, an entity that is classified
as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes, in the form of Holdings Common Units after the Closing, and provides potential
future tax benefits for both the Company and Holdings equity holders (other than the Company) after the Closing when they ultimately
exchange their Holdings Common Units. 

In accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, at the Closing, the issued and outstanding Global Hydrogen Units of each Seller
were transferred, conveyed, assigned and delivered in exchange for (i) a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to the product
of (x) the number of Global Hydrogen Units held by such Seller and (y) the exchange ratio determined by dividing (A) the quotient of 43,000,000
divided by the number of Global Hydrogen Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing by (B) 10.00 per share and (ii)
a number of Holdings Common Units equal to the number of shares of Class B Common Stock received by such Seller pursuant to clause (i)
hereof. 

The Business Combination
was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, although Dune acquired all of
the outstanding equity interests of Global Hydrogen in the Business Combination, Dune was treated as the acquired company
and Global Hydrogen was treated as the accounting acquirer for financial statement reporting purposes. Accordingly, the Business Combination
was treated as the equivalent of Global Hydrogen issuing stock for the net assets of Dune, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net
assets of Dune were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business
Combination were those of Global Hydrogen. 

Employment Agreement 

Effective June 17, 2024,
William Bennet Nance, Jr., the former Chief Executive Officer of Global Hydrogen and a former director of the Company, was terminated
by the Company for Cause (as defined in the employment agreement) and his related employment agreement with Global Hydrogen
was terminated. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Nance s termination as an officer triggered his immediate and automatic
resignation as a director of the Company. 

Forfeiture Agreements 

On March 4, 2024, the Company
entered into Forfeiture Agreements with certain holders of the Company s Class B common stock. Pursuant to the Forfeiture
Agreements, such holders forfeited an aggregate of 1,600,000 Forfeited Shares in exchange for consideration previously received. After
the forfeitures of the Forfeited Shares pursuant to the Forfeiture Agreements, such holders continue to hold an aggregate of 2,700,000
shares of the Company s Class B common stock. 

Delisting of common stock
and warrants 

On December 22, 2023, the
Company received a notice (the Notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that,
unless the Company timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ), the Company s securities
(common stock and warrants) would be subject to suspension and delisting from Nasdaq on January 3, 2024, due to the Company s failure
to satisfy the initial listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market upon closing of the Company s previously announced business
combination in accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5101-2. Specifically, the Company was unable to demonstrate compliance with the Stockholders
Equity, Publicly Held Shares, Market Value of Listed Securities and Market Value of Publicly Held Shares requirements set forth in Nasdaq
Rule 5505. The Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel, which resulted in a stay of any suspension or delisting action pending
the hearing. The Company was granted until June 20, 2024 to demonstrate compliance with the above-referenced listing rules but was unable
to do so by such date. As a result, on June 21, 2024, the Company received notice that the Panel had determined to delist the Company s
securities from Nasdaq and would suspend trading in its securities on the exchange effective at the open of business on June 25, 2024.
Since the delisting, the Company s common stock and warrants have been trading on the OTCQB with trading symbols HGAS 
and HGASW , respectively.

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative
expenses decreased by 11,657 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily
related to a reduction in franchise tax expense and professional fees, partially offset by an increase in legal fees. 

General and administrative
expenses decreased by 115,755 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the period from February 16, 2023 (inception)
to September 30, 2023, primarily related to franchise tax expense and payroll expenses. 

Start-up costs 

Start-up cost of 574 was
incurred at inception of the Company for the period from February 16, 2023 (inception) to September 30, 2023, respectively. 

23 

Interest income 

For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, the Company earned 2,643 and 15,118, respectively, of interest income on cash equivalents. 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and the period from February 16, 2023 (inception) to September 30, 2023, the Company earned 36 and 85, respectively,
of interest income on cash equivalents. 

Change in fair value of warrants liabilities 

The change in fair value
of warrant liabilities of 5,390 and 357,080, respectively, is recognized into other expense and other income, respectively for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since inception, the Company s
primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from contributions from a member and a related party. The Company had 192,444 in cash
and cash equivalents, a working capital deficit of 282,813, and an accumulated deficit of 197,439 as of September 30, 2024. 

The Company intends to operate
with its current cash and cash equivalents on hand. In the future, the Company may borrow money and sell equity to finance its operations.
As the Company has a limited operating history, its liquidity and capital resources may change substantially from past results. 

The Company s future
capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the Company s revenue growth rate, the timing and extent of spending
to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts. In order to finance these opportunities, the Company will
need to raise additional financing. While there can be no assurances, the Company intends to raise such capital through issuances of additional
equity. If additional financing is required from outside sources, the Company may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to the Company
or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when desired, the Company s business, results of operations and
financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. 

As a result of the above,
in connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s FASB ASC Subtopic 205-40, Going Concern, management has determined that the Company s liquidity condition
raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through twelve months from the date these consolidated
financial statements are available to be issued. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern. 

Cash flows for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and the period from February 16, 2023 (inception) to September 30, 2023. 

The following table summarizes cash flows from
operating and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the period from February 16, 2023 (inception) to September
30, 2023:

partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue and net income for the period. 

Net cash and cash equivalents
used in operating activities for the period from February 16, 2023 (inception) to September 30, 2023 was 96,715, primarily related to

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of our consolidated
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts
reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. 

The estimates and underlying
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is
revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current
and future periods. 

A summary of our significant
accounting policies is included in Note 3, Summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies require significant,
difficult or complex judgments by management, often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Our critical policies are summarized in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Fair Value Measurement 

We determine the fair value
of financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy established in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ). ASC 820 identifies fair value as the exchange price, or exit
price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants. The hierarchy describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, as follows: 

Level 1: Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3: Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. 

Management uses valuation
techniques in measuring the fair value of financial instruments, where active market quotes are not available. 

Warrants 

The Company reviews the terms
of warrants to purchase its common stock to determine whether warrants should be classified as liabilities or stockholders deficit
in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. In order for a warrant to be classified in stockholders deficit, the warrant must
be (i) indexed to the Company s equity and (ii) meet the conditions for equity classification. 

If a warrant does not meet
the conditions for stockholders deficit classification, it is carried on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as a warrant
liability measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in the fair value of the warrant recorded in other non-operating losses
(gains) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. If a warrant meets both conditions for equity classification, the warrant
is initially recorded, at its relative fair value on the date of issuance, in stockholders deficit in the consolidated balance
sheets, and the amount initially recorded is not subsequently remeasured at fair value. 

25 

Business Combinations 

The Company evaluates whether
acquired net assets should be accounted for as a business combination or an asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine
whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar
identifiable assets. If so, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If not, the Company applies its judgement to determine
whether the acquired net assets meets the definition of a business by considering if the set includes an acquired input, process, and
the ability to create outputs. 

The Company accounts for
business combinations using the acquisition method when it has obtained control. The Company measures goodwill as the fair value of the
consideration transferred including the fair value of any non-controlling interest recognized, less the net recognized amount of the identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Transaction costs, other than those
associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed
as incurred. 

Any contingent consideration Earnout liabilities is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. For contingent consideration that does not meet
all the criteria for equity classification, such contingent consideration is required to be recorded at its initial fair value at the
acquisition date, and on each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of liability-classified contingent consideration
are recognized on the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change. 

When the initial accounting
for a business combination has not been finalized by the end of the reporting period in which the transaction occurs, the Company reports
provisional amounts. Provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, which does not exceed one year from the acquisition
date. These adjustments, or recognition of additional assets or liabilities, reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances
that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized at that date. 

Income taxes 

The Company follows the asset
and liability method of accounting for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting
and reporting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary,
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

FASB ASC 740 prescribes a
recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and the measurement of tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained
upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as
income tax expense. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals
or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

The Company is expected to
be an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
(the Securities Act ), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ).
The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised
accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would
otherwise apply to private companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or
revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a
result of the accounting standards election, the Company will not be subject to the same implementation timeline for new or revised accounting
standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make comparison of the Company s consolidated
condensed financial statements to those of other public companies more difficult. 

26 

For the impact of recently
issued accounting pronouncements on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, see Note 3 to the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and incorporated herein by
reference. 

Intellectual Property 

Global Hydrogen does not
currently hold material intellectual property beyond certain logos and domain names assigned to the Company by William Bennett Nance,
Jr. 

Government Regulation 

Global Hydrogen plans to
own and operate hydrogen generation plants and to sell the resulting industrial gas. In many jurisdictions, hydrogen, oxygen, and other
gases we will produce and sell, may be classified as fuel or controlled substances, and as such we may be required to obtain relevant
licensing to produce, store, and sell such substances. We intend to acquire such licenses on a project by project and jurisdiction by
jurisdiction basis. 

Some of these gas generation
plants we build or own may be in jurisdictions where CO2 emissions are subject to government regulation. When we produce hydrogen thermochemically,
we will typically deploy carbon recovery systems to significantly reduce below relevant jurisdictional limits or
eliminate the CO2 emissions which otherwise would be released to the atmosphere. 

The construction of facilities
that produce hydrogen will require compliance with government regulation, including local zoning and permitting requirements, such requirements
will depend on the jurisdiction of each project. 

The distribution of hydrogen,
carbon dioxide, and oxygen will require compliance with certain regulatory federal and state regimes and will depend on the relevant jurisdictions. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not required for smaller
reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In designing and evaluating
our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures,
no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired objectives of
the control system. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management
necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Our management, with the
participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
at the reasonable assurance level. 

27 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

We do not consider any claims,
lawsuits, or proceedings that are currently pending against Global Gas, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to our business
or likely to result in a material adverse effect on our future operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. From time to time,
we may be subject to various claims, lawsuits, and other legal and administrative proceedings that may arise in the ordinary course of
business. Some of these claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings may range in complexity and result in substantial uncertainty; it is possible
that they may result in damages, fines, penalties, non-monetary sanctions, or relief. 

Item 5. Other Information 

During the quarter ended
September 30, 2024, (i) no director or officer or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as defined in
Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K intending to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5 1(c) nor non-Rule 10b5-1
trading arrangement, as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K; and (ii) the Company did not adopt or terminate any Rule 10b5-1
