expenses
during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the carrying value of
long-term assets, deferred income tax assets and related valuations, liabilities related to the April 2024 Notes, Earnout
Shares, Private Warrants, and Contingent Consent Warrants (each, as defined below), and share-based compensation. The Company
bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the other sources. The
actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the
extent there are material differences between estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be
affected. 

The Company acquired a federal income tax payable of in connection with the GXII Transaction (as defined below). As a result of post-transaction losses at Elk Creek Resources Corp. ECRC ), a partial release of the valuation allowance attributed to the reduction of the acquired federal income tax payable of was recorded as an income tax benefit in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance against future income tax assets as it is more likely than not that all of the assets will not be realized.

and an accumulated deficit
of as of September 30, 2024. As a development stage issuer, the Company
has not yet commenced its mining operations and accordingly does not generate any revenue. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
had cash of , which will not be sufficient to 

fund normal operations or the repayment of the April 2024 Notes (as further
discussed in Note 5b) for the next twelve months. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

In response to these conditions
and events, the Company plans to obtain additional financing. As disclosed in Note 12, in November 2024 the Company closed an underwritten
public offering (the November 2024 Registered Offering and a non-brokered private placement (the November
2024 Private Offering , and together with the November 2024 Registered Offering, the November Offerings which
resulted in the receipt of net proceeds of , after giving effect to certain fees but before estimated underwriting discounts and offering
expenses. In addition, NioCorp expects to have access to up to 58,577 in net proceeds from the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement,
dated January 26, 2023 (the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement ), between the Company and YA II PN, Ltd.,
an investment fund managed by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP Yorkville ), through April 1, 2026. The Company may pursue
additional sources of financing, and while it has been successful in doing so in the past, there can be no assurance it will be
able to do so in the future. Other than the funds received from the November Offerings, and the potential issuance of Common Shares
under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, the Company did not have any further funding commitments or arrangements
for additional financing as of September 30, 2024. The Company s plans to obtain additional financing have not been finalized,
are subject to market conditions, and are not within the Company s control and therefore cannot be deemed probable. Further,
the Company will be required to raise additional funds for the construction and commencement of operations. As a result, the Company
has concluded that management s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. 

These
interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Company
Overview 

NioCorp
is developing the Elk Creek Project, located in southeast Nebraska. The Elk Creek Project is a development-stage property that
has disclosed niobium, scandium, and titanium reserves and resources and disclosed rare earth mineral resources. The Company is
continuing technical and economic studies around the rare earths contained in the Elk Creek Project s mineral resources
in order to determine whether extraction of rare earth elements can be reasonably justified and economically viable after taking
into account all relevant factors. Niobium has developing applications in the formulation of solid-state lithium-ion batteries,
which may reduce charging times and increase battery safety. Niobium is used to produce various superalloys that are extensively
used in high performance aircraft and jet turbines. It also is used in High-Strength, Low-Alloy steel, a stronger steel used in
automobiles, bridges, structural systems, buildings, pipelines, and other applications that generally increases strength and/or
reduces weight, which can result in environmental benefits, including reduced fuel consumption and material usage and fewer air
emissions. Scandium can be combined with aluminum to make high-performance alloys with increased strength and improved corrosion
resistance. Scandium also is a critical component of advanced solid oxide fuel cells, an environmentally preferred technology
for high-reliability, distributed electricity generation. Titanium is a component of various superalloys and other applications
that are used for aerospace applications, weapons systems, protective armor, medical implants, and many others. It also is used
in pigments for paper, paint, and plastics. Rare earths are critical to electrification and decarbonization initiatives and can
be used to manufacture the strongest permanent magnets commercially available. 

Our
primary business strategy is to advance our Elk Creek Project to commercial production. We are focused on obtaining additional
funds to carry out our near-term planned work programs associated with securing the project financing necessary to complete mine
development and construction of the Elk Creek Project.

over-allotment option to purchase 79,734 additional Series A Public Warrants and 39,867 additional Series B Public Warrants, which
amounts are included in the amounts issued at closing of the November 2024 Registered Offering above. 

On November 13, 2024, the Company
closed a non-brokered private placement (the November 2024 Private Offering and, together with the November 2024
Registered Offering, the November Offerings pursuant to binding subscription agreements with certain accredited
investors (the Private Placement Investors as part of a non-brokered private placement of 2,199,602 units of the
Company (the Units ). Each Unit consists of one Common Share, one Warrant (the Series A Private
Warrants to purchase up to an additional Common Share, and one-half of one Warrant to purchase up to an additional

were approximately 3.5 million before deducting offering expenses. Certain directors and officers of the Company purchased
Units at a price of 1.7675 per Unit, which price includes 0.125 per November Private Warrant and allows such directors and officers
to participate in the November 2024 Private Offering in accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq. The Series A Private Warrants
have an exercise price of 1.75 per underlying Common Share, are exercisable immediately, and will expire on November 13, 2026.
The Series B Private Warrants have an exercise price of 2.07 per underlying Common Share, are exercisable beginning six months

NioCorp currently intends to use the
net proceeds from the November Offerings for working capital and general corporate purposes, including to (i) advance its
efforts to launch construction of the Elk Creek Project and move it to commercial operation and (ii) repay the amount
outstanding under the Company s 2.0 million non-revolving, multiple draw credit facility (the Smith
Loan available pursuant to the Loan Agreement, dated September 11, 2024, by and between the Company and its Chief
Executive Officer CEO ), President, and Executive Chairman, Mark Smith (the Smith Loan Agreement ). The Smith Loan
continues to be available to the Company following the close of the November Offerings.

Elk
Creek Project Update 

On
September 17, 2024, the Advanced Propulsion Center UK announced that an industry consortium, in which NioCorp is participating,
was awarded funding by the UK Government to support a 8.0 million program to design lightweight aluminum alloys and cast automotive
components made of recycled aluminum strengthened by scandium. The consortium, known as Project PIVOT Performance Integrated
Vehicle Optimisation Technology ), includes such companies as Aston Martin (LON:AML), Sarginsons Industries Sarginsons ),
Altair, GESCRAP, and London-based Brunel University. Project PIVOT s Steering Committee includes Jaguar Land Rover, Alcon
Industries, Linamar, Shell Re-Charge, and others. Project PIVOT is led by the Coventry, UK-based aluminum foundry company Sarginsons,
and seeks to revolutionize the global casting industry through overhauling the design, weight, carbon intensity, and production
of cast aluminum automotive parts, with a target of 100 recycled content. 

On
October 30, 2024, the Company announced that it had completed bench-scale testwork at a demonstration-scale processing plant located
in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec built by the Company and L3 Process Development L3 and operated by L3 (the Demonstration
Plant that successfully demonstrated that the process developed for extracting and recovering rare earth oxides found
in the ore at the Elk Creek Project can be used to recycle the rare earth content in rare earth permanent magnets. The L3 team
was able to demagnetize and grind up permanent rare earth magnets and then leach the contained rare earth elements from the magnet.
The successful outcome of this testing opens up the possibility of accepting mixed rare earth concentrate from other mines into
the planned Elk Creek plant once it is constructed and operating to supplement the ore expected to be produced from the Elk Creek
mine. 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company commenced negotiations with landowners in Nebraska to extend the current set
of Option to Purchase agreements for land that is needed for project construction and operation and which the Company does not
already own.

Three-month
period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 

Significant
items affecting operating expenses are noted below: 

Professional
fees decreased for the three-month period in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher costs incurred in 2023 related
to the timing of legal services associated with the Company s SEC registration statements filed in October 2023, as well
as increased audit fees associated with the Company s June 30, 2023 financial statements and increased review fees in connection
with the Company s September 30, 2023 financial statements. 

Exploration
expenditures decreased for the three-month period in 2024 as compared to 2023, as 2023 costs included Demonstration Plant
operation costs. Operation of the Demonstration Plant ended during the prior year. 

Other
operating expenses include costs related to investor relations, general office expenditures, equity offering and proxy expenditures,
board-related expenditures, and other miscellaneous costs. These costs decreased for the three-month period in 2024 as compared
to 2023 primarily due to a decrease in director and officer insurance expense, as well as declines in scandium development initiatives
and non-cash expenses associated with share issuances under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement. 

Other
significant items impacting the change in the Company s net loss are noted below : 

Change
in fair value of Earnout Shares liability represents the changes in fair value related to the shares of Class B common stock
of Elk Creek Resource Corporation ECRC ), an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of NioCorp formerly known as GX
Acquisition Corp. II, the rights of the holders of which to exchange such shares into Common Shares are subject to certain vesting
conditions (such shares of ECRC Class B common stock, the Earnout Shares ). The increase in costs for 2024 represents
the impact of an increase in the Company s Common Share price on the financial modeling used to determine the period end
fair values, whereas 2023 represents the impact of a decline in the Company s Common Share price. 

Change
in fair value of warrant liability represents the changes in period-over-period fair values (based primarily on the impacts
of changing closing Common Share prices) related to the change in fair values of (i) the April 2024 

19 

Warrants; and (ii) the 5,666,667
Warrants (the Private Warrants issued to GX Sponsor II LLC (the Sponsor in connection with the assumption by the Company of
GXII s obligations under the agreement governing the GXII share purchase warrants, as amended by an assignment, assumption
and amendment agreement, in which the Company issued an aggregate of 15,666,626 Warrants (the NioCorp Assumed Warrants consisting of 9,999,959 public NioCorp Assumed Warrants and the Private Warrants, which are discussed in Note 5b to the interim
condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Interest
expense decreased for the three-month period in 2024 as compared to 2023 as 2023 included accretion expense associated with
the unsecured convertible debentures (the Convertible Debentures issued to Yorkville in March 2023. The outstanding balance of the Convertible
Debentures was substantially reduced during fiscal year 2023, resulting in lower accretion during the first quarter of 2024. 

Change
in fair value of convertible debt represents the change in the fair value of the 8.0 million aggregate principal amount of
unsecured notes (the April 2024 Notes ), issued and sold to Yorkville and Lind Global Fund II (together with Yorkville,
the April 2024 Purchasers on April 12, 2024, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, dated April 11, 2024
(the April 2024 Purchase Agreement ), between the Company and each of the April 2024 Purchasers. The Company also
issued to the April 2024 Purchasers, in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of the April 2024 Notes issued to each April
2024 Purchaser, Common Share purchase warrants Warrants to purchase up to 615,385 Common Shares (the April
2024 Warrants ), which are equal to 25 of the aggregate principal amount of April 2024 Notes issued to the April 2024 Purchasers
divided by the exercise price of 3.25, subject to any adjustment to give effect to any stock dividend, stock split or recapitalization. 

Loss
attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the portion of net loss in ECRC not owned by the Company. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
have no revenue generating operations from which we can internally generate funds. To date, our ongoing operations have been financed
by the sale of our equity securities by way of private placements, convertible securities issuances, the exercise of incentive
options to purchase Common Shares Options and Warrants, and related party loans. With respect to currently outstanding
Options and Warrants, we believe that exercise of these instruments, and cash proceeds from such exercises, will not occur unless
and until the market price for our Common Shares equals or exceeds the related exercise price of each instrument. 

The November Offerings are expected
to provide near-term access to capital. The sale of the April 2024 Notes has provided, and The Yorkville Equity Facility Financing
Agreement is expected to provide, near-term and longer-term access to capital. The ability of the Company to draw down on the
Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, at its discretion, is subject to certain limitations and the satisfaction of certain
conditions. When available, the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement provides an opportunity to actively manage the cash
needs of the Company more closely. Historically, cash has generally been available to the Company through private placements of
equity for which the timing did not always coincide with the Company s cash needs. In the near term, the Company intends
to utilize the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement to offset amounts owed under the April 2024 Notes. The Company may
also utilize the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement to potentially generate funds at a time when they are in need.
Alternatively, the Company can also utilize the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement for opportunistic share sales. 

On
July 19, 2024, the Company and Yorkville entered into a make-whole payment agreement under which Yorkville agreed to convert the
remaining principal and accrued interest of 553,767 under the Convertible Debenture into Common Shares in exchange for a 95,000
make-whole payment. 

On September 11, 2024, the Company and
Mark Smith entered into the Smith Loan Agreement, which provides for a 2.0 million non-revolving credit facility. An initial drawdown
under the Smith Loan Agreement of 33,000 was completed on September 11, 2024, and additional drawdowns totaling 471,000 were
received subsequent to September 30, 2024. On November 6, 2024, the Company repaid 250,000 of the interest and principal outstanding under the Smith Loan. 

20 

Pursuant
to the securities purchase agreement, dated January 26, 2023, between the Company and Yorkville, on March 17, 2023, Yorkville
advanced a total amount of 15,360 to NioCorp in consideration of the issuance by NioCorp to Yorkville of (i) the Convertible
Debentures and (ii) Warrants, exercisable for up to 1,789,267 Common Shares for cash or, if at any time there is no effective
registration statement registering, or no current prospectus available for, the resale of the underlying Common Shares, on a cashless
basis, at the option of the holder, at a price per Common Share of approximately 8.9422, subject to adjustment to give effect
to any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar transaction (the Financing Warrants ). On September
17, 2024, all remaining outstanding Financing Warrants expired. 

On September 17, 2024, the Company s Common Share price was below the threshold set forth in the Lind Consent, and accordingly,
the Company issued 2,816,742 Contingent Consent Warrants to Lind. Each Contingent Consent Warrant is exercisable for one Common
Share at an exercise price of 2.308 and may be exercised at any time prior to their expiration on September 17, 2028. The number
of Contingent Consent Warrants issued was based on 5.0 million divided by the five-day volume weighted average price of the Common
Shares on September 16, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company
had cash of 0.15 million and a working capital deficit of 6.9 million, compared to cash of 2.0 million and a working capital
deficit of 9.0 million on June 30, 2024. 

We
expect that the Company will operate at a loss for the foreseeable future. The Company s current planned cash needs are
approximately 25.0 million until June 30, 2025, inclusive of any repayments of principal and interest due on the April 2024 Notes.
On September 4, 2024, NioCorp entered into (i) a consent and waiver (the September Yorkville Consent to the April
2024 Notes issued and sold to Yorkville pursuant to the April 2024 Purchase Agreement and (ii) a consent and waiver (together
with the Yorkville Consent, the September Consents to the April 2024 Notes issued and sold to Lind II. On October
3, 2024, NioCorp entered into (i) a consent and waiver (the October Yorkville Consent to the April 2024 Notes issued
and sold to Yorkville pursuant to the April 2024 Purchase Agreement and (ii) a consent and waiver (together with the October Yorkville
Consent, the October Consents to the April 2024 Notes issued and sold to Lind II pursuant to the April 2024 Purchase
Agreement. See Note 5b to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the terms of the
September Consents and October Consents. Except as modified by the September Consents and the October Consents, the terms of the
April 2024 Notes as previously disclosed are unchanged. 

In
addition to outstanding accounts payable and short-term liabilities, our average monthly planned expenditures through June 30,
2024 are expected to be approximately 1,915,000 per month where approximately 355,000 is for corporate overhead and estimated
costs related to securing financing necessary for advancement of the Elk Creek Project. This includes general overhead costs,
satisfying outstanding accounts payable, and repayment of the April 2024 Notes and the Smith Loan Agreement. This also includes
anticipated financing costs associated with the Elk Creek Project, including an updated mine plan in connection with the EXIM
application process. The scope of these financing costs remains under discussion with EXIM. Approximately 1,560,000 per month
is planned for expenditures relating to the advancement of the Elk Creek Project by NioCorp s majority owned subsidiary,
ECRC. The Company s ability to continue operations and fund our current work plan is dependent on management s ability
to secure additional financing. 

The Company anticipates that it does
not have sufficient cash on hand to continue to fund basic operations for the next twelve months, and additional funds totaling
 24.0 million to 25.0 million, net of funds raised from advances under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, borrowings
under the Smith Loan, and funds raised in the November Offerings, are likely to be necessary to continue advancing the
Elk Creek Project in the areas of financing, permitting, and detailed engineering. While the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing
Agreement and the November Offerings may provide the Company with access to additional capital, the Company will likely require
additional capital to meet its cash needs. Management is actively pursuing such additional sources of debt and equity financing,
and while it has been successful in doing so in the past, there can be no assurance it will be able to do so in the future.

Creek property lease commitments are 13,200 until June 30, 2025. To maintain our currently held properties and fund our currently
anticipated general and administrative costs and planned exploration and development activities at the Elk Creek Project for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, the Company will likely require additional financing during the current fiscal year. Should
such financing not be available in that timeframe, we will be required to reduce our activities and will not be able to carry
out all our presently planned activities at the Elk Creek Project. 

21 

On
June 6, 2023, the Company announced that it had submitted an application to EXIM for debt financing (the EXIM Financing to fund the project costs for the Elk Creek Project, under EXIM s Make More in America initiative. The EXIM
Financing is subject to, among other matters, the satisfactory completion of due diligence, the negotiation and settlement of
final terms, and the negotiation of definitive documentation. There can be no assurance that the EXIM Financing will be completed
on the terms described herein or at all. The Company was informed that its application received approval by the first of three
reviews by the EXIM Transaction Review Committee (the TRC on October 2, 2023. During the quarter, EXIM continued
to process the Company s application for debt financing under EXIM s Make More in America Program. The Company s
application sits at TRC in the second step in EXIM s four-step approval process. The Company continues to meet with EXIM
as well as providing responses to requests for additional information from EXIM and to the consultants that are conducting due
diligence on the Company s application on behalf of EXIM. 

We
are currently unable to estimate how long the application process may take, and there can be no assurances that we will be able
to successfully negotiate a final commitment of debt financing from EXIM. 

Except for the proceeds
from the November Offerings, potential funding from advances under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, and potential
funding under the Smith Loan Agreement, each as discussed above, and the potential exercise of Options and Warrants, we currently
have no further funding commitments or arrangements for additional financing at this time, and there is no assurance that we will
be able to obtain any such additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, dated as of
March 17, 2023 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Exchange Agreement ), by and among NioCorp, ECRC
and the Sponsor, NioCorp is restricted from issuing equity or equity-linked securities (other than Common Shares) or any preferred
equity or non-voting equity if such issuance would adversely impact the rights of the holders of the shares of Class B common
stock of ECRC, without the consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B common stock of ECRC. The April 2024
Purchase Agreement also contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit NioCorp s ability to use the proceeds
from the April 2024 Purchase Agreement to pay related party debt or to enter into any variable rate transaction, including issuances
of equity or debt securities that are convertible into Common Shares at variable rates and any equity line of credit, at-the-market
agreement or other continuous offering of Common Shares, other than with Yorkville, subject to certain exceptions. Notwithstanding
the restrictions set forth in the Exchange Agreement and the April 2024 Purchase Agreement, there is significant uncertainty that
we would be able to secure any additional financing in the current equity or debt markets. The quantity of funds to be raised
and the terms of any proposed equity or debt financing that may be undertaken will be negotiated by management as opportunities
to raise funds arise. Management may pursue funding sources of both debt and equity financing, including but not limited to the
issuance of equity securities in the form of Common Shares, Warrants, subscription receipts, or any combination thereof in units
of the Company pursuant to private placements to accredited investors or pursuant to public offerings in the form of underwritten/brokered
offerings, registered direct offerings, or other forms of equity financing and public or private issuances of debt securities
including secured and unsecured convertible debt instruments or secured debt project financing. Management does not currently
know the terms pursuant to which such financings may be completed in the future, but any such financings will be negotiated at
arm s-length. Future financings involving the issuance of equity securities or derivatives thereof will likely be completed
at a discount to the then-current market price of the Company s securities and will likely be dilutive to current shareholders.
In addition, we could raise funds through the sale of interests in our mineral properties, although current market conditions
and other recent worldwide events have substantially reduced the number of potential buyers/acquirers of any such interests. However,
we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to be successful in raising such funds. 

Based
on the conditions described within, management has concluded, as supported by the notes that accompany our financial statements
for the year ended June 30, 2024, that substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The interim
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared under the assumption
that we will continue as a going concern. As defined under S-K 1300, we are a development stage issuer and we have incurred losses
since our inception. We may not have sufficient cash, including Option and Warrant exercises subsequent to June 30, 2024, to fund
normal operations and meet debt obligations for the next twelve months without deferring payment on certain current liabilities
and raising additional funds. Uncertainty in capital markets, supply chain disruptions, increased interest rates and inflation,
and the potential for geographic recessions have contributed to general global economic uncertainty. During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, these events continued to create uncertainty with respect to overall project funding and timelines. We believe
that the going concern uncertainty cannot be alleviated with confidence until the Company has entered into a business climate
where funding of its planned ongoing operating activities is secured. Therefore, these factors raise substantial doubt as to our
ability to continue as a going concern. 

22 

We
have no exposure to any asset-backed commercial paper. Other than cash held by our subsidiaries for their immediate operating
needs in Colorado and Nebraska, all of our cash reserves are on deposit with major U.S. and Canadian chartered banks. We do not
believe that the credit, liquidity, or market risks with respect thereto have increased as a result of the current market conditions.
However, in order to achieve greater security for the preservation of our capital, we have, of necessity, been required to accept
lower rates of interest, which has also lowered our potential interest income. 

Operating
Activities 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s operating activities consumed 0.6 million of cash (2023:
 2.7 million). The cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflects the
Company s funding of losses of 2.1 million and increased fair value related to the Earnout Shares liability and other
non-cash transactions. Overall, operational outflows during the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased from the
corresponding period of 2023 due to costs and expenditures incurred in connection with the Company s Demonstration
Plant. Going forward, the Company s working capital requirements are expected to increase substantially in connection
with the development of the Elk Creek Project. 

Financing
Activities 

Financing
outflows were 1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 (2023 inflows: 1.5 million), with 2024 inflows reflecting
the gross receipts of 0.7 million from Common Share issuances under the Yorkville Equity Facility Financing Agreement, offset
by 1.9 million of convertible debt repayments. 

Cash
Flow Considerations 

The Company has historically relied
upon debt and equity financings to finance its activities. Subject to the restrictions set forth in the Exchange Agreement and
the April 2024 Purchase Agreement, the Company may pursue additional debt and/or equity financing in the medium term; however,
there can be no assurance the Company will be able to obtain any required financing in the future on acceptable terms. 

The
Company has limited financial resources compared to its proposed expenditures, no source of operating income, and no assurance
that additional funding will be available to it for current or future projects, although the Company has been successful in the
past in financing its activities through the sale of equity securities. 

The
ability of the Company to arrange additional financing in the future will depend, in part, on the prevailing capital market conditions,
and its success in developing the Elk Creek Project. Any quoted market for the Common Shares may be subject to market trends generally,
notwithstanding any potential success of the Company in creating revenue, cash flows, or earnings, and any depression of the trading
price of the Common Shares could impact its ability to obtain equity financing on acceptable terms. 

Historically,
the Company has used net proceeds from issuances of Common Shares to provide sufficient funds to meet its near-term exploration
and development plans and other contractual obligations when due. However, development and construction of the Elk Creek Project
will require substantial additional capital resources. This includes near-term funding and, ultimately, funding for Elk Creek
Project construction and other costs. See Liquidity and Capital Resources above for the Company s discussion
of arrangements related to possible future financings. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

There
have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading Critical Accounting Estimates and Recent Accounting
Pronouncements as of June 30, 2024, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Certain
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 

If
NioCorp (or a subsidiary) is a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S.
holder of Common Shares or other NioCorp securities (as determined under applicable U.S. federal income tax law), then certain
significant adverse tax consequences could apply to such U.S. holder, including requirements to treat any gain realized upon a
disposition of Common Shares (or other securities) as ordinary income, to include certain excess 

23 

distributions on
Common Shares in income, and to pay an interest charge on a portion of any such gain or distribution. NioCorp believes that it
was classified as a PFIC during the taxable years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and, based on the current composition of its income
and assets, as well as current business plans and financial expectations, that it may be classified as a PFIC for its current
taxable year or in future taxable years. No opinion of legal counsel or ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS concerning the PFIC status of NioCorp or any subsidiary has been obtained or is currently planned to be requested. The determination
of whether any corporation was, or will be, a PFIC for a taxable year depends, in part, on the application of complex U.S. federal
income tax rules, which are subject to differing interpretations. In addition, whether any corporation will be a PFIC for any
taxable year depends on the assets and income of such corporation over the course of each such taxable year and, as a result,
cannot be predicted with certainty as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, even if NioCorp concluded
that it or any subsidiary was not classified as a PFIC, the IRS could challenge such determination and a court could sustain the
challenge. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that NioCorp or any subsidiary will not be classified as a PFIC for any taxable
year. Each holder of Common Shares or other NioCorp securities should consult its own tax advisors regarding the PFIC status of
NioCorp and each subsidiary thereof and the resulting tax consequences to the holder, as well as any potential to mitigate such
tax consequences through a QEF or mark-to-market election. See the Risk Factors section
of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest
rate risk 

The
Company s exposure to changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company s earned interest income on
cash deposits and short-term investments. The Company maintains a balance between the liquidity of cash assets and the interest
rate return thereon. The carrying amount of financial assets, net of any provisions for losses, represents the Company s
maximum exposure to credit risk. 

Foreign
currency exchange risk 

The
Company incurs expenditures in both U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars. Canadian dollar expenditures are primarily related to certain
Common Share-related costs and corporate professional services. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs
of our operating activities. To reduce this risk, we maintain sufficient cash balances in Canadian dollars to fund expected near-term
expenditures. 

24 

Commodity
price risk 

The
Company is exposed to commodity price risk related to the elements associated with the Elk Creek Project. A significant decrease
in the global demand for these elements may have a material adverse effect on our business. The Elk Creek Project is not in production,
and the Company does not currently hold any commodity derivative positions. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
management of NioCorp Developments Ltd. has evaluated, under the supervision of and with the participation of our management,
including the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer CFO ), the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that, as of September 30,
2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting described below. 

Notwithstanding
the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our CEO and CFO have concluded that the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Existing as of September 30, 2024 

The
management of NioCorp Developments Ltd. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the
criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (the COSO Framework ). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that,
as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting described below. 

Material
Weaknesses 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Management
concluded that the material weaknesses disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2024, continued to exist as of September 30, 2024. Specifically, management identified deficiencies in the principles associated
with the control environment, risk assessment, control activities, and monitoring components of internal control, based on the
criteria established by the COSO Framework, that constitute material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate. 

Control
 Environment : The Company does not have sufficient personnel with the appropriate
 levels of knowledge, experience, and training in accounting and internal control over
 financial reporting commensurate with the complexity of the Company s financing
 transactions and associated reporting requirements. This material weakness contributed
 to additional material weaknesses further described below. 

Risk
 Assessment : The Company does not have a formal process to identify, update, and assess
 financial reporting risks due to changes in the Company s business practices, including
 entering into increasingly complex transactions that could significantly impact the design
 and operation of the Company s control activities. 

Control
 Activities : Management did not maintain effective controls over: 

monitoring
 and assessing the work of third-party specialists, including the evaluation of the appropriateness
 of accounting conclusions, and 

25 

the
 evaluation of certain inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of instruments
 and features associated with complex debt and equity transactions. 

Monitoring
 Activities : Management did not appropriately: 

select,
 develop, and perform ongoing evaluation to ascertain whether the components of internal
 controls are present and functioning, and 

evaluate
 and communicate internal control deficiencies in a timely manner to those parties responsible
 for taking corrective action. 

As
previously disclosed, these material weaknesses resulted in errors that required the restatement of Company s consolidated
financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, as well as the restatement of the Company s
condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the interim periods ended September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021, March
31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. Additionally, these material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of
the account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial
statements that would not be prevented or timely detected. 

Remediation
Plan for the Material Weaknesses 

To
address our material weaknesses existing as of September 30, 2024, we have implemented a detailed plan to address each individual
material weakness identified, including the following: 

We
 have, and will continue, to engage outside accounting and internal control consultants
 with subject matter expertise to supplement our level of knowledge, experience, and training
 in accounting and internal control over financial reporting. 

We
 plan to develop a formal risk assessment process to ensure that it is robust and frequent
 enough for the Company s business, including the identification of risks, the level
 of detail in our risk assessment, and the clarity of the linkage between risks and internal
 controls associated with the material weaknesses. The results of this effort are expected
 to enable us to effectively identify, develop, evolve and implement controls and procedures
 to address risks. 

We
 plan to develop and provide incremental training to the accounting and financial reporting
 team regarding accounting for and valuation of complex financial instruments. 

Management
 will develop a monitoring program to periodically evaluate and assess whether those responsible
 for controls are conducting their activities in accordance with their design, such that
 there is contemporaneous evidence that the controls are present and functioning and will
 communicate internal control deficiencies in a timely manner to those parties responsible
 for taking corrective action. 

The
process of designing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is a continuous effort that requires
management to anticipate and react to changes in our business, economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant
resources. As we continue to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional actions to remediate
the material weaknesses or modify the remediation actions described above. 

While
we continue to devote significant time and attention to these remediation efforts, the material weaknesses will not be considered
remediated until management completes the design and implementation of the actions described above and the controls operate for
a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than as discussed above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September
30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Pursuant
to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal
or other mine in the United States are required to disclose specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic
reports. These reporting requirements are based on the safety and health requirements applicable to mines under the Federal Mine
Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor s Mine
Safety and Health Administration MSHA ). During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company and
its subsidiaries and their properties or operations were not subject to regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act and thus no disclosure
is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

ITEM
5. OTHER INFORMATION 

November
2024 Private Placement 

On
November 13, 2024, the Company closed the November 2024 Private Offering with the Private Placement Investors of an aggregate
of 2,199,602 Units. Each Unit consists of one Common Share, one Series A Private Warrant to purchase one Common Share and one-half
of one Series B Private Warrant to purchase one-half of one Common Share. Each Series A Private Warrant is exercisable for one
Common Share at a price per Common Share of 1.75. The Series A Private Warrants may be exercised at any time on or after the
date of issuance and will expire on November 13, 2026. Each Series B Private Warrant is exercisable for one Common Share at a
price per Common Share of 2.07. The Series B Private Warrants may be exercised at any time beginning six months and one day from
the date of issuance and will expire on November 13, 2029. 

The
November Private Warrants contain provisions that prohibit the exercise if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially
own more than 4.99 of the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. A holder of November
Private Warrants may increase or decrease this percentage to a percentage not in excess of 9.99 by providing notice to the Company,
which increase will not be effective until at least 61 days following such notice. November Private Warrant holders will not have
the rights or privileges of a holder of Common Shares with respect to the Common Shares underlying such November Private Warrants,
including any voting rights, until the holder exercises such November Private Warrants. There is no established trading market
for any of the November Private Warrants and the Company does not expect a market to develop. In addition, the Company does not
intend to apply for the listing of any of the November Private Warrants on any national securities exchange or other trading market. 

27 

In
connection with the November 2024 Private Offering, the Company entered into subscription agreements (the Subscription
Agreements by and between the Company and the Private Placement Investors. The Subscription Agreements contain the terms
of the Private Placement and typical representations and warranties from the Private Placement Investors to the Company and the
Company to the Private Placement Investors. 

Certain
of the Company s officers and directors purchased an aggregate of 239,999 Units in the November 2024 Private Offering.
Each officer and director of the Company who purchased Units in the November 2024 Private Offering paid a purchase price of 1.7675
per unit (the Insider Unit Price ), which is equal to the consolidated closing bid price for the Common Shares as
reported by the Nasdaq on November 1, 2024 plus 0.125 per associated November Private Warrant. The remaining investors in the
November 2024 Private Offering, who are not affiliated with the Company (but with whom the Company has a pre-existing relationship),
purchased an aggregate of 1,959,603 Units at a purchase price per Unit of 1.57, which is equal to 90 of the volume weight average
price of the Common Shares on Nasdaq for the five-day period ended November 1, 2024. Gross proceeds to the Company from the November
2024 Private Offering are expected to be approximately 3.5 million. 

The
foregoing description of the Subscription Agreements is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Subscription Agreements,
a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.8 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing descriptions of
the November Private Warrants are qualified in their entirety by the full text of the Form of Series A Private Warrant and Form
of Series B Private Warrant, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 4.9 and 4.10, respectively, to this Report and are incorporated
herein by reference. 

This
Report does not constitute an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell, the Units or any other securities. The
Units and the underlying securities have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered
or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements 

The
Units were issued on a private offering basis to the Private Placement Investors with whom the Company had a pre-existing relationship pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 506(b) of Regulation D thereunder
and Section 4(a)(2) thereof, in each case, pursuant to the representations and covenants the Private Placement Investors made
to the Company in connection with their purchase of the Units. 

Rule
10b5-1 Trading Arrangements 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act)

 the Offering at a price of US 1.7675 per Unit. However, such directors and officers are

 be granted to such directors and officers or their affiliates, the Issuer could determine
 to sell to such directors and officers or their affiliates fewer Units than they indicated
 an interest in purchasing.

that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together
with the Holder s Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s
Affiliates (such Persons, Attribution Parties )), would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of 

the foregoing sentence, the number of Common Shares beneficially owned by the Holder
and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with
respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of Common Shares which would be issuable upon (i)
exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution
Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including,
without limitation, any other Common Share Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation
contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding
sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company is not representing
to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible

applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together
with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion
of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder s determination of whether this
Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties)
and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company
shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group
status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding Common Shares, a Holder may
rely on the number of outstanding Common Shares as reflected in (A) the Company s most recent periodic or annual report filed
with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice
by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of Common Shares outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of
a Holder, the Company shall within three (3) Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of Common Shares
then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding Common Shares shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion
or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since
the date as of which such number of outstanding Common Shares was reported. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation 
shall be 4.99 of the number of 

Common Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of Common Shares issuable
upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation
provisions of this Section 2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99 of the number of Common
Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of Common Shares upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder
and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply. Any increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be
effective until the 61 st day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be
construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this paragraph
(or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained
or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained
in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant. 

ii. Issuance
Limitation . Notwithstanding anything in this Warrant to the contrary, unless approval from the shareholders of the Company
with respect to the Transactions has been obtained, the Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant
hereunder to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, the number of Common Shares issued pursuant to such exercise,
together with the number of Common Shares issued pursuant to any prior exercise(s) of this Warrant, plus the number of Other Securities
previously issued in the Transactions, would exceed 19.99 of the Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to November 6, 2024. 

Section 3 . Certain
Adjustments . 

a) Share
Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a share dividend or otherwise
makes a distribution or distributions on its Common Shares or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in Common
Shares (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Common Shares issued by the Company upon exercise of this Warrant),
(ii) subdivides outstanding Common Shares into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse share split)
outstanding Common Shares into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification of Common Shares any securities of
the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number
of Common Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall
be the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this
Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment
made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders 

entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of
a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

b) Subsequent
Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3(a) above, if at any time the Company grants, issues
or sells any Common Share Equivalents or rights to purchase shares, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record
holders of any class of Common Shares (the Purchase Rights ), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire,
upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder
had held the number of Common Shares acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on exercise
hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is taken
for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders
of Common Shares are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, that, to the extent
that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership
of such Common Shares as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in
abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation). 

c) Pro
Rata Distributions . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of Common
Shares (and not to the Holder) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash and cash dividends) or rights or warrants
to subscribe for or purchase any security other than the Common Shares, then in each such case the Exercise Price shall be adjusted
by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled
to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the VWAP determined as of the record date mentioned
above, and of which the numerator shall be such VWAP on such record date less the then per share fair market value at such record
date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one outstanding Common Share as determined
by the Board of Directors in good faith. In either case the adjustments shall be described in a statement provided to the Holder
of the portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or such subscription rights applicable to one Common Share.
Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date
mentioned above. 

d) Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related
transactions effects any merger, amalgamation, arrangement or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any,
direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant
to which holders of Common Shares are permitted to sell, 

tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property
and has been accepted by the holders of greater than 50 of the outstanding Common Shares or greater than 50 of the voting power
of the common equity of the Company, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any
reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Shares or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the
Common Shares are effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly
or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a share purchase agreement or other business combination (including,
without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, merger, amalgamation or arrangement) with another Person or group
of Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires greater than 50 of the outstanding Common Shares or greater than 50 of
the voting power of the common equity of the Company (each a Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent
exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon
such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, the same amount and kind of securities, cash
or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately
prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant
without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant (the Alternate Consideration ).
For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate
Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one Common Share in such Fundamental Transaction,
and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative
value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Shares are given any choice as to the securities,
cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate
Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction, the Company or any Successor Entity (as defined below) shall, at the Holder s
option, exercisable at any time concurrently with, or within 30 days after, the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction (or,
if later, the date of the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction), purchase this Warrant from the Holder
by paying to the Holder an amount of cash equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined below) of the remaining unexercised portion
of this Warrant on the date of the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction; provided , however , that, if the
Fundamental Transaction is not within the Company s control, including not approved by the Company s Board of Directors,
the Holder shall only be entitled to receive from the Company or any Successor Entity the same type or form of consideration (and
in the same proportion), at the Black Scholes Value of the unexercised portion of this Warrant, that is being offered and paid
to the holders of Common Shares of the Company in connection with the Fundamental Transaction, whether that consideration be in
the form of cash, shares or any combination thereof, or whether the holders of Common Shares are given the choice to receive from
among alternative forms of consideration in connection with the Fundamental Transaction; provided , further , that
if holders of Common Shares of the Company are not offered or paid any consideration in 

such Fundamental Transaction, such holders
of Common Shares will be deemed to have received common shares of the Successor Entity (which Successor Entity may be the Company
following such Fundamental Transaction) in such Fundamental Transaction. Black Scholes Value means the value
of this Warrant based on the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model obtained from the OV function on Bloomberg determined
as of the day of consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction for pricing purposes and reflecting (A) a risk-free interest
rate corresponding to the U.S. Treasury rate for a period equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of the
applicable contemplated Fundamental Transaction and the Termination Date, (B) an expected volatility equal to the 100 day volatility
obtained from the HVT function on Bloomberg (determined utilizing a 365-day annualization factor) as of the Trading Day immediately
following the public announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental Transaction, (C) the underlying price per share used
in such calculation shall be the greater of (i) the sum of the price per share being offered in cash, if any, plus the value of
any non-cash consideration, if any, being offered in such Fundamental Transaction and (ii) the VWAP immediately preceding the public
announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental Transaction (or the consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction,
if earlier), (D) a remaining option time equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental
Transaction and the Termination Date and (E) a zero cost of borrow. The payment of the Black Scholes Value will be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (or such other consideration) within the later of (i) five Business Days of the Holder s
election and (ii) the date of consummation of the Fundamental Transaction. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental
Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the Successor Entity to assume in writing all of the
obligations of the Company under this Warrant in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3(d) pursuant to written agreements
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such
Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant a security of
the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant which is exercisable
for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the Common
Shares acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant)
prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder to such shares of
capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the Common Shares pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the
value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price being for the purpose of
protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which
is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor
Entity shall be added to the term Company under this Warrant (so that from and after the occurrence or consummation
of such Fundamental Transaction, each and every provision of this Warrant referring to the Company shall refer instead
to each of the Company and the Successor Entity or Successor Entities, jointly and severally), and the Successor Entity or Successor
Entities, jointly and severally with the Company, may exercise every right and power of the 

Company prior thereto and the Successor
Entity or Successor Entities shall assume all of the obligations of the Company prior thereto under this Warrant with the same
effect as if the Company and such Successor Entity or Successor Entities, jointly and severally, had been named as the Company
herein. 

e) Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Section 3, the number of Common Shares deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the
sum of the number of Common Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

f) Notice
to Holder . 

i. Adjustment
to Exercise Price . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the Company shall promptly
deliver to the Holder by email a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to
the number of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

ii. Notice
to Allow Exercise by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the
Common Shares, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Shares, (C)
the Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Shares rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any
securities of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any shareholders of the Company shall be required in connection with
any reclassification of the Common Shares, any consolidation or merger to which the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) is a party,
any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Shares are
converted into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be delivered by email to
the Holder at its last email address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register (as defined below) of the Company, at least ten
(10) calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which
a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to
be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Shares of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption,
rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or
share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Shares
of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Shares for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale, transfer 

or share exchange; provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein
or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the
extent that any notice provided in this Warrant constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report
on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled to exercise this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice
to the effective date of the event triggering such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein. 

g) Voluntary
Adjustment By Company . Subject to the rules and regulations of the Trading Market, the Company may at any time during the term
of this Warrant reduce the then current Exercise Price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the board
of directors of the Company. 

Section 4 . Transfer

a) Transferability .
This Warrant and all rights hereunder (including, without limitation, any registration rights) are transferable, in whole or in
part, upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its designated agent, together with a written assignment
of this Warrant substantially in the form attached hereto properly completed and duly executed by the Holder or its agent or attorney

and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly

division or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants
to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the initial
issuance date of this Warrant and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant
thereto. 

c) Warrant
Register . The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the Warrant
Register ), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The 

Company may deem and treat the registered
Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution to the Holder, and
for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary. 

d) Transfer
Restrictions . This Warrant may only be disposed of in compliance with state and U.S. federal securities laws and shall not
be transferred unless the Warrant is (i) registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and
under applicable state securities or blue sky laws or (ii) eligible for resale without volume or manner of sale restrictions or
current public information requirements pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, this Warrant may only be transferred
in compliance with applicable Canadian securities laws. 

e) Representation
by the Holder . The Holder, by the acceptance hereof, represents and warrants that it is acquiring this Warrant and, upon any
exercise hereof, will acquire the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, for its own account and not with a view to or for
distributing or reselling this Warrant or such Warrant Shares or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable
state securities laws, except pursuant to sales registered under, or exempt from the registration requirements of, the Securities
Act. 

Section 5 . Miscellaneous . 

a) No
Rights as Shareholder Until Exercise; No Settlement in Cash . This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights,
dividends or other rights as a shareholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in Section 2(d)(i), except
as expressly set forth in Section 3. Without limiting any rights of a Holder to receive cash payments pursuant to Section 2(d)(i)
and Section 2(d)(iv) herein, in no event shall the Company be required to net cash settle an exercise of this Warrant. 

b) Loss,
Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any share certificate relating to the Warrant
Shares, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it, and upon surrender and
cancellation of such Warrant or share certificate, if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or share certificate
of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant or share certificate. 

c) Saturdays,
Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or
granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding
Business Day. 

d) Authorized
Shares . 

The Company covenants
that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Shares a sufficient
number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights under this Warrant.
The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers who are charged
with the duty of issuing the necessary Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company
will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without
violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Trading Market upon which the Common Shares may be
listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented
by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant and payment for such Warrant Shares in accordance
herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges created by
the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such
issue). 

Except and
to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending
its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or
sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this
Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions
as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above the amount payable
therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate
in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant
and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory
body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform its obligations under this Warrant. 

Before taking
any action which would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the
Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary
from any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof. 

e) Governing
Law . All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be governed
by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts
of law principles that would result in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction. Each party agrees 

that
all legal proceedings concerning the interpretations, enforcement and defense of the transactions contemplated by this Warrant
(whether brought against a party hereto or their respective affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, employees
or agents) shall be commenced exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York. Each party hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan for
the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein,
and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is improper or is an inconvenient venue for
such proceeding. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such
suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery)
to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Warrant and agrees that such service shall constitute good
and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to
serve process in any other manner permitted by law. If either party shall commence an action, suit or proceeding to enforce any
provisions of this Warrant, the prevailing party in such action, suit or proceeding shall be reimbursed by the other party for
their reasonable attorneys fees and other costs and expenses incurred with the investigation, preparation and prosecution
of such action or proceeding. 

f) Restrictions .
The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered, will have restrictions
upon resale imposed by provincial, state and federal securities laws. 

g) Nonwaiver
and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate
as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers or remedies. Without limiting any other provision
of this Warrant, if the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant, which results in any
material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and
expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees, excluding those of appellate proceedings, incurred by
the Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder. 

h) Notices .
Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries to be provided by the Holders hereunder including, without limitation,
any Notice of Exercise, shall be in writing and delivered personally, by e-mail, or sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier
service, addressed to the Company, at 7000 South Yosemite Street, Suite 115, Centennial, Colorado, 80112, Attention: Neal Shah,

constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously
file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

i) Limitation
of Liability . No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase
Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the Holder
for the purchase price of any Common Shares or as a shareholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company
or by creditors of the Company. 

j) Remedies .
The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled
to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation
for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert
the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

k) Successors
and Assigns . Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns
of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant and
shall be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares. 

l) Amendment .
This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company, on the one hand,
and the Holder, on the other hand. 

m) Severability .
Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions
of this Warrant. 

n) Headings .
The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed a part of
this Warrant.

e) 
 Holder s Exercise Limitations . 

i. 
 Beneficial Ownership . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not effect any exercise
of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise,
to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the
Holder (together with the Holder s Affiliates, and any other Persons 

acting
as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s Affiliates (such Persons, Attribution Parties )),
would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing
sentence, the number of Common Shares beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include
the number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but
shall exclude the number of Common Shares which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of
this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion
of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Common
Share Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially
owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for
purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company is not representing to
the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible
for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section 2(e)
applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together
with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion
of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder s determination of whether this
Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties)
and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company
shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group
status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding Common Shares, a Holder may
rely on the number of outstanding Common Shares as reflected in (A) the Company s most recent periodic or annual report
filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written
notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of Common Shares outstanding. Upon the written or oral
request of a Holder, the Company shall within three (3) Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of
Common Shares then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding Common Shares shall be determined after giving effect
to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including 

this
Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding Common Shares
was reported. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall be 4.99 of the number of Common Shares outstanding
immediately after giving effect to the issuance of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon notice
to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2(e), provided that the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99 of the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after giving
effect to the issuance of Common Shares upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e)
shall continue to apply. Any increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61 st day
after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner
otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which
may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements
necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to
a successor holder of this Warrant. 

ii. 
 Issuance Limitation . Notwithstanding anything in this Warrant to the contrary, unless approval from the shareholders of
the Company with respect to the Transactions has been obtained, the Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion of
this Warrant hereunder to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, the number of Common Shares issued pursuant to
such exercise, together with the number of Common Shares issued pursuant to any prior exercise(s) of this Warrant, plus the number
of Other Securities previously issued in the Transactions, would exceed 19.99 of the Common Shares outstanding immediately prior
to November 6, 2024. 

Section
3 . Certain Adjustments . 

a) 
 Share Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a share dividend or
otherwise makes a distribution or distributions on its Common Shares or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable
in Common Shares (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Common Shares issued by the Company upon exercise of this
Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding Common Shares into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse
share split) outstanding Common Shares into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification of Common Shares any
securities of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall
be the number of Common Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the
denominator shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this 

Warrant
shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become effective immediately after the record
date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately
after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

b) 
 Subsequent Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3(a) above, if at any time the Company
grants, issues or sells any Common Share Equivalents or rights to purchase shares, warrants, securities or other property pro
rata to the record holders of any class of Common Shares (the Purchase Rights ), then the Holder will be entitled
to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired
if the Holder had held the number of Common Shares acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations
on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a
record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which
the record holders of Common Shares are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however,
that, to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding
the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent
(or beneficial ownership of such Common Shares as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such
extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder
exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). 

c) 
 Pro Rata Distributions . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall distribute to all holders
of Common Shares (and not to the Holder) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash and cash dividends) or rights
or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any security other than the Common Shares, then in each such case the Exercise Price
shall be adjusted by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed for determination of
shareholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the VWAP determined as of the
record date mentioned above, and of which the numerator shall be such VWAP on such record date less the then per share fair market
value at such record date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one outstanding
Common Share as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. In either case the adjustments shall be described in a statement
provided to the Holder of the portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or such subscription rights applicable
to one Common Share. Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately
after the record date mentioned above. 

d) 
 Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in
one or more related transactions effects any merger, amalgamation, arrangement or consolidation of the Company with or into another
Person, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions,
(iii) any, direct or 

indirect,
purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders
of Common Shares are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted
by the holders of greater than 50 of the outstanding Common Shares or greater than 50 of the voting power of the common equity
of the Company, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization
or recapitalization of the Common Shares or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Shares are effectively
converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more
related transactions consummates a share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization,
recapitalization, spin-off, merger, amalgamation or arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person
or group acquires greater than 50 of the outstanding Common Shares or greater than 50 of the voting power of the common equity
of the Company (each a Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the
Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior
to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as it would have been
entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to such Fundamental
Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant without regard to
any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant (the Alternate Consideration ). For purposes
of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration
based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one Common Share in such Fundamental Transaction, and the
Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value
of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Shares are given any choice as to the securities,
cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate
Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction, the Company or any Successor Entity (as defined below) shall, at the
Holder s option, exercisable at any time concurrently with, or within 30 days after, the consummation of the Fundamental
Transaction (or, if later, the date of the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction), purchase this Warrant
from the Holder by paying to the Holder an amount of cash equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined below) of the remaining
unexercised portion of this Warrant on the date of the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction; provided , however ,
that, if the Fundamental Transaction is not within the Company's control, including not approved by the Company's Board of Directors,
the Holder shall only be entitled to receive from the Company or any Successor Entity the same type or form of consideration (and
in the same proportion), at the Black Scholes Value of the unexercised portion of this Warrant, that is being offered and paid
to the holders of Common Shares of the Company in connection with the Fundamental Transaction, whether that consideration be in
the form of cash, shares or any combination thereof, or whether the holders of Common Shares are given the choice to receive from
among alternative forms of 

consideration
in connection with the Fundamental Transaction; provided , further , that if holders of Common Shares of the Company
are not offered or paid any consideration in such Fundamental Transaction, such holders of Common Shares will be deemed to have
received common shares of the Successor Entity (which Successor Entity may be the Company following such Fundamental Transaction)
in such Fundamental Transaction. Black Scholes Value means the value of this Warrant based on the Black-Scholes
Option Pricing Model obtained from the OV function on Bloomberg determined as of the day of consummation of the
applicable Fundamental Transaction for pricing purposes and reflecting (A) a risk-free interest rate corresponding to the U.S.
Treasury rate for a period equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental
Transaction and the Termination Date, (B) an expected volatility equal to the 100 day volatility obtained from the HVT function
on Bloomberg (determined utilizing a 365-day annualization factor) as of the Trading Day immediately following the public announcement
of the applicable contemplated Fundamental Transaction, (C) the underlying price per share used in such calculation shall be the
greater of (i) the sum of the price per share being offered in cash, if any, plus the value of any non-cash consideration, if
any, being offered in such Fundamental Transaction and (ii) the VWAP immediately preceding the public announcement of the applicable
contemplated Fundamental Transaction (or the consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, if earlier), (D) a remaining
option time equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction and the Termination
Date and (E) a zero cost of borrow. The payment of the Black Scholes Value will be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds (or such other consideration) within the later of (i) five Business Days of the Holder s election and (ii) the date
of consummation of the Fundamental Transaction. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which
the Company is not the survivor (the Successor Entity to assume in writing all of the obligations of the
Company under this Warrant in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3(d) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction
and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant a security of the Successor Entity
evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding
number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the Common Shares acquirable and
receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental
Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking
into account the relative value of the Common Shares pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of
capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic
value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall be added
to the term Company under this Warrant (so that from and after the occurrence or consummation of such Fundamental
Transaction, each and every provision of this Warrant referring to the Company shall refer instead to each of the
Company and the Successor Entity or 

Successor
Entities, jointly and severally), and the Successor Entity or Successor Entities, jointly and severally with the Company, may
exercise every right and power of the Company prior thereto and the Successor Entity or Successor Entities shall assume all of
the obligations of the Company prior thereto under this Warrant with the same effect as if the Company and such Successor Entity
or Successor Entities, jointly and severally, had been named as the Company herein. 

e) 
 Calculations . All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share,
as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 3, the number of Common Shares deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given
date shall be the sum of the number of Common Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

f) 
 Notice to Holder . 

i. 
 Adjustment to Exercise Price . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the
Company shall promptly deliver to the Holder by email a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any
resulting adjustment to the number of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

ii. 
 Notice to Allow Exercise by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever
form) on the Common Shares, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common
Shares, (C) the Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Shares rights or warrants to subscribe for or
purchase any securities of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any shareholders of the Company shall be required in
connection with any reclassification of the Common Shares, any consolidation or merger to which the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries)
is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common
Shares are converted into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be delivered
by email to the Holder at its last email address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register (as defined below) of the Company,
at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the
date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a
record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Shares of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions,
redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,
transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the
Common Shares of record shall be entitled to 

exchange
their Common Shares for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,
transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof
shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided
in this Warrant constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the
Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain
entitled to exercise this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering
such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.

in such division or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or
Warrants to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated
the initial issuance date of this Warrant and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable
pursuant thereto. 

c) 
 Warrant Register . The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose
(the Warrant Register ), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The Company may deem and
treat the registered Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution
to the Holder, and for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary. 

d) 
 Transfer Restrictions . This Warrant may only be disposed of in compliance with state and U.S. federal securities laws and
shall not be transferred unless the Warrant is (i) registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act and under applicable state securities or blue sky laws or (ii) eligible for resale without volume or manner of sale restrictions
or current public information requirements pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, this Warrant may only be
transferred in compliance with applicable Canadian securities laws. 

e) 
 Representation by the Holder . The Holder, by the acceptance hereof, represents and warrants that it is acquiring this Warrant
and, upon any exercise hereof, will acquire the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, for its own account and not with a
view to or for distributing or reselling this Warrant or such Warrant Shares or any part thereof in violation of the Securities
Act or any applicable state securities laws, except pursuant to sales registered under, or exempt from the registration requirements
of, the Securities Act. 

Section
5 . Miscellaneous . 

a) 
 No Rights as Shareholder Until Exercise; No Settlement in Cash . This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting
rights, dividends or other rights as a shareholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in Section 2(d)(i),
except as expressly set forth in Section 3. Without limiting any rights of a Holder to receive cash payments pursuant to Section
2(d)(i) and Section 2(d)(iv) herein, in no event shall the Company be required to net cash settle an exercise of this Warrant. 

b) 
 Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any share certificate relating to the Warrant
Shares, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it, and upon surrender
and cancellation of such Warrant or share certificate, if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or share
certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant or share certificate. 

c) 
 Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right
required or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next
succeeding Business Day. 

d) 
 Authorized Shares . 

The
Company covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common
Shares a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights
under this Warrant. The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers
who are charged with the duty of issuing the necessary Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant.
The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided
herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Trading Market upon which the Common
Shares may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights
represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant and payment for such Warrant
Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens
and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously
with such issue). 

Except
and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation,
amending its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms of this Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above
the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares
upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions
or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform
its obligations under this Warrant. 

Before
taking any action which would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or
in the Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be
necessary from any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof. 

e) Governing
Law . All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be governed
by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New 

York,
without giving effect to conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction.
Each party agrees that all legal proceedings concerning the interpretations, enforcement and defense of the transactions contemplated
by this Warrant (whether brought against a party hereto or their respective affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, partners,
members, employees or agents) shall be commenced exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York.
Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New
York, Borough of Manhattan for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated
hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is improper or is
an inconvenient venue for such proceeding. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process
being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery
(with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Warrant and agrees that such service
shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit
in any way any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. If either party shall commence an action, suit or
proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Warrant, the prevailing party in such action, suit or proceeding shall be reimbursed
by the other party for their reasonable attorneys fees and other costs and expenses incurred with the investigation, preparation
and prosecution of such action or proceeding. 

f) 
 Restrictions . The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered,
will have restrictions upon resale imposed by provincial, state and federal securities laws. 

g) 
 Nonwaiver and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder
shall operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers or remedies. Without limiting
any other provision of this Warrant, if the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant,
which results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to
cover any costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees, excluding those of appellate proceedings,
incurred by the Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies
hereunder. 

h) 
 Notices . Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries to be provided by the Holders hereunder including, without
limitation, any Notice of Exercise, shall be in writing and delivered personally, by e-mail, or sent by a nationally recognized
overnight courier service, addressed to the

the e-mail address set forth in this Section prior to 5:30 p.m. (New York City time) on any date, (ii) the next Trading Day after

material, non-public information regarding the Company or any Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice
with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

i) 
 Limitation of Liability . No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant
to purchase Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability
of the Holder for the purchase price of any Common Shares or as a shareholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted
by the Company or by creditors of the Company. 

j) 
 Remedies . The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages,
will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not
be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees
to waive and not to assert the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

k) 
 Successors and Assigns . Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby
shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted
assigns of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant

 Amendment . This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company,
on the one hand, and the Holder, on the other hand. 

m) 
 Severability . Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective
and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such
provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions
or the remaining provisions of this Warrant. 

n) 
 Headings . The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be
deemed a part of this Warrant.
