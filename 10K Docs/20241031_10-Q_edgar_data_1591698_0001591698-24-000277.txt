days notice or less, the Company also offers term agreements to its clients, which are generally in length. Recurring fees are derived from cloud-based payroll and HCM software solutions which includes payroll processing and related services such as payroll reporting and tax filing services, time and labor services, time clock rentals, and HR-related software solutions, including employee management and benefits enrollment and administration, substantially all of which are delivered on a monthly basis. Substantially all of the Company s recurring fees are satisfied over time as services are provided. The performance obligations related to recurring services are generally satisfied monthly as services are provided, with fees charged and collected based on a per-employee-per-month fee. The Company has certain optional performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time including the sales of time clocks and W-2 services. Implementation services and other consist mainly of nonrefundable implementation fees, which involve setting the client up in, and loading data into, the Company s cloud-based modules. These implementation activities are considered set-up activities. The Company has determined that the nonrefundable upfront fees provide certain clients with a material right to renew the contract. 
 Disaggregation of revenue 
 Implementation services and other Total revenues from contracts 
 Deferred revenue 
 The timing of revenue recognition for recurring revenue is consistent with the timing of invoicing as they occur monthly as services are provided based on a per-employee-per-month fee. As such, the Company does not generally recognize contract assets or liabilities related to recurring revenue.

 Deferral of revenue Revenue recognized ) ) Balance at end of the period 
 Deferred revenue related to these nonrefundable upfront fees are recorded within Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities on the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company expects to recognize these deferred revenue balances of in fiscal 2025, in fiscal 2026 and in fiscal 2027 and thereafter. 
 Deferred contract costs 
 The Company defers certain selling and commission costs that meet the capitalization criteria under ASC 340-40. The Company also capitalizes certain costs to fulfill a contract related to its proprietary products if they are identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations and are expected to be recovered under ASC 340-40. Implementation fees are treated as nonrefundable upfront fees and the related implementation costs are required to be capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit, which is the period in which the Company expects to recover the costs and enhance its ability to satisfy future performance obligations. 
 The Company utilizes the portfolio approach to account for both the cost of obtaining a contract and the cost of fulfilling a contract. These capitalized costs are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which has been determined to be over years based on the Company s average client life and other qualitative factors, including rate of technological changes. The Company does not incur any additional costs to obtain or fulfill contracts upon renewal. The Company recognizes additional selling and commission costs and fulfillment costs when an existing client purchases additional services. These additional costs only relate to the additional services purchased and do not relate to the renewal of previous services.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The statements included herein that are not based solely on historical facts are forward looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by us in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including items discussed below and under Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 filed with the SEC on August 2, 2024. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a leading cloud-based provider of human capital management, or HCM, and payroll software solutions that deliver a comprehensive platform for the modern workforce. Our HCM and payroll platform offers an intuitive, easy-to-use product suite that helps businesses attract and retain talent, build culture and connection with their employees, and streamline and automate HR and payroll processes. 
 Effective management of human capital is a core function in all organizations and requires a significant commitment of resources. Our cloud-based software solutions, combined with our unified database architecture, are highly flexible and configurable and feature a modern, intuitive user experience. Our platform offers automated data integration with hundreds of third-party partner systems, such as 401(k), benefits and insurance provider systems. We plan to continue to invest in research and development efforts that will allow us to offer a broader selection of products to new and existing clients focused on experiences that solve our clients challenges. 
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business by increasing our number of clients, and we intend to invest in our business to achieve this purpose. We market and sell our solutions through our direct sales force. Our sales and marketing expenses have increased as we have added sales representatives and related sales and marketing personnel. We intend to continue to grow our sales and marketing organization across new and existing geographic territories. In addition to growing our number of clients, we intend to grow our revenue over the long term by increasing the number of solutions that clients purchase from us. To do so, we must continue to enhance and grow the number of solutions we offer to advance our platform. 
 We also believe that delivering a positive service experience is an essential element of our ability to sell our solutions and retain our clients. We supplement our comprehensive software solutions with an integrated implementation and client service organization, all of which are designed to meet the needs of our clients and sales prospects. We expect to continue to invest in and grow our implementation and client service organization as our client base grows. 
 We continue to invest across our entire organization as we continue to grow our business over the long term. These investments include increasing the number of personnel across all functional areas, along with improving our solutions and infrastructure to support our growth. The timing and amount of these investments will vary based on the rate at which we add new clients and personnel and scale our application development and other activities. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them, which will make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. We expect these investments to increase our costs on an absolute basis, but as we grow our number of clients and our related revenues, we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale and increased operating leverage. As a result, we expect our gross and operating margins will improve over the long term. 
 Paylocity Holding Corporation is a Delaware corporation, which was formed in November 2013. Our business operations are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiaries. 
 
 Key Metrics 
 We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. 
 Revenue Growth 
 Our recurring revenue model and high annual revenue retention rates provide significant visibility into our future operating results and cash flow from operations. This visibility enables us to better manage and invest in our business. Total revenues increased from 317.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 363.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 14 year-over-year increase. The increase in year-over-year revenue growth was driven by the strong performance by our sales team. Uncertainties around market and economic conditions may impact revenue growth, which we have recently experienced and may continue to experience, through

 fluctuations in client employee counts, elongated sales cycles, client losses, and a changing interest rate environment, among other factors. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA 
 We disclose Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures, because we use them to evaluate our performance, and we believe Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA assist in the comparison of our performance across reporting periods by excluding certain items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We believe these metrics are commonly used in the financial community, and we present them to enhance investors understanding of our operating performance and cash flows. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), and you should not consider Adjusted Gross Profit as an alternative to gross profit or Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to net income, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our definition of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA may be different than the definition utilized for similarly-titled measures used by other companies. 
 We define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit before amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, amortization of certain acquired intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises, and other items as defined below. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and other items as defined below.

 Basis of Presentation 
 Revenues 
 Recurring and other revenue 
 We generate substantially all of our recurring and other revenue from ongoing subscriptions to our cloud-based HCM and payroll software solutions, which are recurring in nature. Recurring fees for each client generally include a base fee in addition to a fee based on the number of client employees and the number of products a client uses. We also charge fees attributable to our preparation of W-2 documents and annual required filings on behalf of our clients. We charge implementation fees for professional services provided to implement our HCM and payroll solutions. 
 The number of client employees on our platform and the mix of products purchased by a client as well as the timing of services provided with respect to those client employees can vary each period. As such, the number of client employees on our system is not necessarily a good indicator of our financial results in any given period. Recurring and other revenue accounted for 92 of our total revenues for both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. 
 While the majority of our agreements with clients are generally cancellable by the client on 60 days notice or less, we also have term agreements, which are generally two years in length. Our agreements do not include general rights of return and do not provide clients with the right to take possession of the software supporting the services being provided. We recognize recurring fees in the period in which services are provided and the related performance obligations have been satisfied. We defer implementation fees related to our proprietary products over a period generally up to 24 months. 
 Interest Income on Funds Held for Clients 
 We earn interest income on funds held for clients. We collect funds for employee payroll payments and related taxes in advance of remittance to employees and taxing authorities. Prior to remittance to employees and taxing authorities, we earn interest on these funds through demand deposit accounts with financial institutions with which we have automated clearing house, or ACH, arrangements. We also earn interest by investing a portion of funds held for clients in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues includes costs to provide our HCM and payroll solutions which primarily consists of employee-related expenses, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, relating to the provision of ongoing client support and implementation activities, payroll tax filing, distribution of printed checks and other materials as well as delivery costs, computing costs, amortization of certain acquired intangibles and bank fees associated with client fund transfers. Costs related to recurring support are generally expensed as incurred. Implementation costs related to our proprietary products are capitalized and amortized over a period of 7 years. Our cost of revenues is expected to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we increase our client base. However, we expect to realize cost efficiencies over the long term as our business scales, resulting in improved operating leverage and increased margins. 
 We also capitalize a portion of our internal-use software costs, which are then primarily amortized as Cost of revenues. We amortized 9.5 million and 13.8 million of capitalized internal-use software costs during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff, including wages, commissions, stock-based compensation, bonuses, benefits, marketing expenses and other related costs. Our sales personnel earn commissions and bonuses for attainment of certain performance criteria based on new sales throughout the fiscal year. We capitalize certain selling and commission costs related to new contracts or purchases of additional services by our existing clients and amortize them over a period of 7 years. 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 We will seek to grow our number of clients for the foreseeable future, and therefore our sales and marketing expense is expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our sales organization and expand our marketing activities. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our research and development and product management teams, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, maintenance, quality assurance and testing of new technologies and ongoing refinement of our existing solutions. Research and development expenses, other than internal-use software costs qualifying for capitalization, are expensed as incurred. 
 We capitalize a portion of our development costs related to internal-use software. The timing of our capitalized development projects may affect the amount of development costs expensed in any given period. The table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.

 We expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our product offerings and extend our technological leadership by investing in the development of new technologies and introducing them to new and existing clients. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but to vary as a percentage of total revenue on a period-to-period basis. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits for our finance and accounting, legal, information systems, human resources and other administrative departments. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, occupancy costs, insurance and other corporate expenses. While we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as our company continues to grow, we expect to realize cost efficiencies as our business scales. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income (expense) generally consists of interest income related to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, net of losses on disposals of property and equipment and interest expense related to our revolving credit facility.

Table of Contents 

 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.5 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in other income was primarily due to higher interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents as a result of higher average daily balances of those corporate cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate was 22.3 and 28.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to state and local income taxes, partially offset by federal research and development credits. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to state and local income taxes. 
 
 Quarterly Trends and Seasonality 
 Our overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Our historical results should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future results of operations. 
 We experience fluctuations in revenues and related costs on a seasonal basis, which are primarily seen in our fiscal third quarter, which ends on March 31 of each year. Specifically, our recurring revenue is positively impacted in our fiscal third quarter as a result of our preparation of W-2 documents for our clients employees in advance of tax filing requirements. Our interest income earned on funds held for clients is also positively impacted during our fiscal third quarter as a result of our increased collection of funds held for clients. Certain payroll taxes are primarily collected during our fiscal third quarter and subsequently remitted. The seasonal fluctuations in revenues also positively impact gross profits during our fiscal third quarter. Our historical results for our fiscal third quarter should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future results of operations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions and, to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. 
 Accounting estimates used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the operating environment changes. Our critical accounting policies and use of estimates are disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2024 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 2, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary liquidity needs are related to the funding of general business requirements, including working capital requirements, research and development, and capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2024, our principal source of liquidity was 453.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding the proceeds drawn from our credit facility further described below. We maintain a credit agreement that provides for a 550.0 million revolving credit facility, which may be increased up to 825.0 million. In September 2024, we borrowed 325.0 million under this credit facility to fund the acquisition of Airbase Inc. in October 2024, which remained outstanding at September 30, 2024. Refer to Notes 8 and 13 of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the credit agreement and Airbase acquisition, respectively. 
 In April 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500.0 million of our common stock (the "Repurchase Program"). The extent to which we repurchase shares, the number and price of any shares repurchased and the timing of any repurchases depends on the market price of our common stock, trading volume, general market conditions and other corporate and economic considerations. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 350.0 million remains 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 authorized for repurchases under the Repurchase Program, and there were no repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We may invest portions of our excess cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. These investments may consist of commercial paper, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury securities, and other securities with credit quality ratings of A-1 or higher as well as in money market funds. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any corporate investments classified as available-for-sale securities. 
 In order to grow our business, we intend to increase our personnel and related expenses and to make investments in our platform, data centers and general infrastructure, some of which may be significant. The timing and amount of these investments will vary based on our financial condition, the rate at which we add new clients and new personnel and the scale of our module development, data centers and other activities. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them, which could negatively impact our liquidity and cash flows during any particular period and may make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. However, we expect to fund our operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and other investments principally with cash flows from operations, and to the extent that our liquidity needs exceed our cash from operations, we would look to our cash on hand or utilize the remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility to satisfy those needs. 
 Funds held for clients and client fund obligations vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of payroll and tax obligations due. Our payroll processing activities involve the movement of significant funds from accounts of employers to employees and relevant taxing authorities. Though we debit a client s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf, there is a delay between our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities and when the incoming funds from the client to cover these amounts payable actually clear into our operating accounts. We currently have agreements with various major U.S. banks to execute ACH and wire transfers to support our client payroll and tax services. We believe we have sufficient capacity under these ACH arrangements to handle all transaction volumes for the foreseeable future. We primarily collect fees for our services via ACH transactions at the same time we debit the client s account for payroll and tax obligations and thus are able to reduce collectability and accounts receivable risks. 
 We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, future cash flow from operations, and access to our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing working capital, capital expenditure and other liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter, for the foreseeable future. 
 The following table sets forth data regarding cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 2024 Net cash provided by operating activities 62,142 91,455 Cash flows from investing activities: Purchases of available-for-sale securities (92,567) (20,174) Proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities 101,216 25,022 Capitalized internal-use software costs (14,193) (15,210) Purchases of property and equipment (3,454) (2,328) Other investing activities (406) (638) Net cash used in investing activities (9,404) (13,328) Cash flows from financing activities: Net change in client fund obligations (93,566) (621,746) Borrowings under credit facility 325,000 Taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards (28,825) (21,536) Other financing activities (11) (11) Net cash used in financing activities (122,402) (318,293) Net change in cash, cash equivalents and funds held for clients' cash and cash equivalents (69,664) (240,166)

Table of Contents 

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 62.1 million and 91.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The change in net cash provided by operating activities from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities, accompanied by improved operating results after adjusting for non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense and deferred income tax expense (benefit) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 9.4 million and 13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The net cash used in investing activities is significantly impacted by the timing of purchases and sales and maturities of investments as we invest portions of funds held for clients in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. The amount of funds held for clients invested will vary based on timing of client funds collected and payments due to client employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities. 
 The change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to 76.2 million in less proceeds from the sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a 72.4 million decrease in purchases of available-for-sale securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 122.4 million and 318.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The change in net cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of an increase in the net change in client fund obligations of 528.2 million due to the timing of client funds collected and related remittance of those funds to client employees and taxing authorities, partially offset by 325.0 million in borrowings under our credit facility during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 At September 30, 2024, our principal commitments consisted of 325.0 million in borrowings on our revolving credit facility, which is contractually not due in the next twelve months, and related interest payments, as well as 62.5 million in operating lease obligations, of which 9.8 million is due in the next twelve months. We also had 70.9 million in purchase obligations, of which 41.7 million is due in the next twelve months. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We expect to continue to invest in capital spending as we continue to grow our business and expand and enhance our operating facilities, data centers and technical infrastructure. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth. In the event that our sales growth or other factors do not meet our expectations, we may eliminate or curtail capital projects in order to mitigate the impact on our use of cash. Capital expenditures were 3.5 million and 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, exclusive of capitalized internal-use software costs of 14.2 million and 15.2 million for the same periods, respectively.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We have operations primarily in the United States and are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate and certain other exposures including risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the United States. Refer to Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 2, 2024 for risks related to our business. 
 We have not used, nor do we intend to use, derivatives to mitigate the impact of interest rate or other exposure or for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 778.5 million and funds held for clients of 2,340.4 million. We deposit our cash and cash equivalents and significant portions of our funds held for clients in demand deposit accounts with various financial institutions. We may invest portions of our excess cash and cash equivalents and funds held for clients in marketable securities including commercial paper, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury securities, and other securities, as well as in money market funds. Our investment policy is focused on generating higher yields from these investments while preserving liquidity and capital. However, as a result of our investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our financial statements. 
 In a falling rate environment, a decline in interest rates would decrease our interest income earned on both cash and cash equivalents and funds held for clients. An increase in the overall interest rate environment may cause the market value of our investments in fixed rate available-for-sale securities to decline. If we are forced to sell some or all of these securities at lower market values, we may incur investment losses. However, because we classify all marketable securities as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates until such securities are sold or decreases in fair value are deemed due to expected credit losses. We have not recorded any credit impairment losses on our portfolio to date. 
 Based upon a sensitivity model that measures market value changes caused by interest rate fluctuations, an immediate 100-basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the market value of our available-for-sale securities by 10.3 million as of September 30, 2024. An immediate 100-basis point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the market value of our available-for-sale securities by 10.3 million as of September 30, 2024. Fluctuations in the value of our available-for-sale securities caused by changes in interest rates are recorded in other comprehensive income and are only realized if we sell the underlying securities. 
 Additionally, as described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, we maintain a credit agreement that provides for a revolving credit facility credit facility in the aggregate amount of 550.0 million, which may be increased up to 825.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at a rate based upon the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment or an adjusted base rate plus an applicable margin based on our then-applicable net total leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024 , we had 325.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. Because interest rates applicable to the credit facility are variable, we are exposed to market risk from changes in the underlying index rates, which affects our interest expense. A hypothetical change of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have had a significant impact on our results of operations. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as effected without receipt of consideration by the Company. Any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than regular, periodic cash dividends paid on Stock pursuant to the Company s dividend policy) to which the Participant is entitled by reason of ownership of Units acquired pursuant to this Award will be immediately subject to the provisions of this Award on the same basis as all Units originally acquired hereunder. Any fractional Unit or share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Instead, unless the Committee determines that Section 9 is applicable, the number of Earned Units and Vested Units shall be determined as follows

system upon which the Stock may then be listed.

The Award has been granted pursuant to the Paylocity Holding Corporation 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ), as amended to the Grant Date, the provisions of which are incorporated herein by reference. This Award is intended to constitute an Award of Performance Shares described in Section 10 of the Plan. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the determination of the number of Units which vest and or are to be settled in Shares shall be determined based on the provisions contained in the Grant Notice and this Agreement, and the provisions set forth in Section 10.7(a) of the Plan (relating to certain Terminations of Service) shall not apply. 
 
 Unless otherwise defined herein or in the Grant Notice, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned by the Plan. 
 
 1. THE AWARD . 
 
 The Company has granted to the Participant the Award set forth in the Grant Notice, which, depending on the extent to which the Performance Measure is attained during the Performance Period, may result in the Participant earning as little as zero (0) Units or as many as the Maximum Number of Units. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, each Unit, to the extent it is earned and becomes a Vested Unit, represents a right to receive on the Settlement Date one (1) Share. Unless and until a Unit has been determined to be an Earned Unit and has vested and become a Vested Unit as set forth in the Grant Notice, the Participant will have no right to settlement of such Units. Prior to settlement of Vested Units, such Units will represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. 
 
 2. COMMITTEE DETERMINATION OF EARNED UNITS . 
 
 2.1 Level of Performance Measure Attained. As soon as practicable following completion of the Performance Period, but in any event no later than the first scheduled Vesting Date, the Committee shall determine the level of attainment of the Performance Measure during the Performance Period, the resulting Relative TSR Multiplier and the number of Units which have become Earned Units. 
 
 2.2 Adjustment for Leave of Absence or Part-Time Work. Unless otherwise required by law or Company policy, if the Participant takes one or more unpaid leaves of absence, the Committee may, in its discretion, make such modifications to the Award as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise required by law or Company policy, if the Participant commences working on a part-time basis during the Performance Period, the Committee may, in its discretion, make such modifications to the Award as it deems appropriate. 
 
 3. VESTING OF EARNED UNITS . 
 
 3.1 Normal Vesting. Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, Earned Units shall vest and become Vested Units as provided in the Grant Notice. 
 
 3.2 Vesting Upon a Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, the vesting of Earned Units shall be determined in accordance with Section 9. 

4. TERMINATION OF SERVICE . 
 
 4.1 Death or Disability. If the Participant s Service terminates by reason of the death or Disability of the Participant either (a) before completion of the Performance Period or (b) after completion of the Performance Period but before the Vesting Date, the Participant shall not forfeit the Award. Instead, unless the Committee determines that Section 9 is applicable, the number of Earned Units and Vested Units shall be determined as follows 
 
 (a) If such termination of Service occurs before completion of the Performance Period, then a number of Earned Units shall be determined for a special Performance Period ending on the day of such termination of Service (the Special Performance Period ). The applicable level of performance for the Special Performance Period shall be determined as provided by Appendix A , except that performance shall be determined for portion of the Performance Period ending with the last day of the Special Performance Period. The number of Vested Units shall be determined by multiplying such number of Earned Units by the ratio of the number of days of the Participant s Service during the Special Performance Period to the number of days contained in the original Performance Period. The number of Vested Units so determined shall be settled in accordance with Section 5. The Participant shall forfeit all Units not determined to be Vested Units in accordance with this Section, and the Participant shall not be entitled to any payment therefor. 
 
 (b) If such termination of Service occurs after completion of the Performance Period but before the Vesting Date, then the number of Earned Units shall be determined for the Performance Period in accordance with Section 2, and all such Earned Units be deemed Vested Units upon such determination by the Committee and settled in accordance with Section 5 as if the Participant s Service had continued through the Vesting Date. 
 
 4.2 Other Termination of Service. In the event that the Participant s Service terminates for any reason, with or without cause, other than by reason of the death or Disability of the Participant, the Participant shall forfeit and the Company shall automatically reacquire all Units which are not, as of the time of such termination, Vested Units, and the Participant shall not be entitled to any payment therefor. 
 
 5. SETTLEMENT OF THE AWARD . 
 
 5.1 Issuance of Shares . Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3 and Section 6 below, the Company shall issue to the Participant on the Settlement Date with respect to each Vested Unit to be settled on such date one (1) Share.

 5.2 Beneficial Ownership of Shares Certificate Registration . The Participant hereby authorizes the Company, in its sole discretion, to deposit any or all Shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to the settlement of the Award with the Company s transfer agent, including any successor transfer agent, to be held in book entry form, or to deposit such Shares for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship of which the Company has notice.

 5.3 Restrictions on Grant of the Award and Issuance of Shares . The grant of the Award and issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Award shall be subject to compliance with all 

applicable requirements of U.S. federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities. No Shares may be issued hereunder if the issuance of such Shares would constitute a violation of any applicable U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws or other laws or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any Shares subject to the Award shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the settlement of the Award, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company. Further, regardless of whether the transfer or issuance of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Units has been registered under the Securities Act or has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any State, the Company may impose additional restrictions upon the sale, pledge, or other transfer of the Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on share certificates and the issuance of stop-transfer instructions to the Company s transfer agent) if, in the judgment of the Company and the Company s counsel, such restrictions are necessary in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, the securities laws of any State, or any other law. 
 
 5.4 Fractional Shares . The Company shall not be required to issue fractional Shares upon the settlement of the Award. 
 
 6. TAX WITHHOLDING ADVICE .

The Company shall have no obligation to deliver Shares until the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company have been satisfied by the Participant. 
 
 6.2 Assignment of Sale Proceeds. Subject to compliance with applicable law and the Company s Trading Compliance Policy, if permitted by the Company, the Participant may satisfy the Participating Company s tax withholding obligations in accordance with procedures established by the Company providing for delivery by the Participant to the Company or a broker approved by the Company of properly executed instructions, in a form approved by the Company, providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale with respect to some or all of the Shares being acquired upon settlement of Units. 
 
 6.3 Withholding in Shares. The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to require the Participant to satisfy all or any portion of a Participating Company s tax withholding obligations by deducting from the Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant in settlement of the Award a number of whole Shares having a fair market value, as determined by the Company as of the date on which the tax withholding obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such tax withholding obligations determined by the applicable statutory withholding rates. 
 
 6.4 Tax Advice . The Participant represents, warrants and acknowledges that the Company has made no warranties or representations to the Participant with respect to the income tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Participant is in no manner relying on the Company or the Company s representatives for an assessment of such tax consequences.

APPENDIX A 
 Performance Measure and Performance Multiplier 
 Applicable to Market Stock Unit Award Granted on 
 _________ 
 1. Relative TSR Percentile means the percentile (rounded to the nearest whole percentile) of the Company s TSR ranking relative to the TSRs of the Comparator Companies, determined in accordance with the following formula 
 
 Where, 
 R is an integer equal to the Company s ranking when the TSRs of the Company and the Comparator Companies are ranked from the highest to the lowest TSR, with the highest being one (1) and 
 N is equal to the number of Comparator Companies plus the Company. 
 For example, if there are 2999 Comparator Companies and the Company s TSR ranked 500 th highest among the TSRs of a group of 3000 Index Companies (i.e., the Comparator Companies plus the Company), the Relative TSR Percentile of the Company would be 83 , which is the result of (1 ((500 1) (3000-1))) x 100 (rounded to the nearest whole percentile). 
 2. TSR or Total Stockholder Return means, for the Company and each Comparator Company, the growth rate for the applicable Performance Period, expressed as a percentage (rounded to the nearest 1 100 of 1 ), in the value of one share of such company s common stock during the Performance Period due to the appreciation in the price per share and dividends paid during such period with respect to such share, assuming dividends are reinvested, calculated as follows 
 
 Where, 
 Ending Price is the Ending Average Per Share Closing Price of such company 
 Dividends are the aggregate values of all dividends paid to a stockholder of record of such company with respect to one share of common stock during the Performance Period and 
 Beginning Price is the Beginning Average Per Share Closing Price of such company. 
 3. Beginning Average Per Share Closing Price means, for the Company and each Comparator Company, the Average Per Share Closing Price for the 30 calendar days ending with the calendar day immediately preceding the first day of the Performance Period. 

4. Comparator Companies means each of the companies, other than the Company, included in the Russell 3000 Index and determined in accordance with Appendix B . 
 5. Earned Units means, with respect to each Performance Period, the number of Units (rounded up to the nearest whole Unit), if any (not to exceed the Maximum Number of Units for such Performance Period) shall be equal to the product of (i) the Target Number of Units for such Performance Period multiplied by (ii) the Relative TSR Multiplier provided, however, that if the Company s TSR for the Performance Period is a negative number, then the number of Earned Units shall not exceed 100 of the Target Number of Units. 
 6. Ending Average Per Share Closing Price means, for the Company and each Comparator Company, the Average Per Share Closing Price for the 30 calendar days ending with the last calendar day of the applicable Performance Period. 
 7. Average Per Share Closing Price means, for the Company and each Comparator Company, the volume weighted average of the daily closing prices per share of common stock of such company as reported on the national or regional securities exchange or quotation system constituting the primary market for such common stock for all trading days falling within the applicable averaging period. 
 8. Relative TSR Multiplier means a ratio determined as set forth on Appendix C . 
 The Relative TSR Percentiles serve as cliffs. For example, if Relative TSR Percentile was 59 , the Relative TSR Multiplier would be 95 . 
 
 9. Negative Company TSR . If the Company s TSR for the Performance Period is a negative number, then the number of Earned Units shall not exceed 100 of the Target Units (i.e., the Relative TSR Multiplier may not exceed 1.00), regardless of the Company s Relative TSR Percentile for the Performance Period. 

APPENDIX B 
 COMPARATOR COMPANIES 
 The Comparator Companies consist of the companies (other than the Company) included in the Russell 3000 Index as of the Grant Date. 
 If applicable during a Performane Period, a Comparator Company s TSR shall be modified during the Performance Period as follows 
 If a Comparator Company becomes bankrupt during the Performance Period, then its TSR for the Performance Period will be deemed to equal negative 100 . 
 If a Comparator Company ceases to be publicly traded for a reason other than bankruptcy during the Performance Period, then its TSR will be determined on the date immediately prior to its ceasing to be publicly traded. 
 If a Comparator Company merges during the Performance Period with another entity that is not a Comparator Company, then its TSR will be determined on the date immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. 
 If two Comparator Companies merge during the Performance Period, then (a) with respect to the acquired company, its TSR will be determined on the date immediately prior the effective time of the merger and (b) with respect to the acquiring company, its TSR will be determined as if the merger did not occur. 
 If a Comparator Company distributes a portion of its business in a spin-off transaction during the Performance Period, then in determining its TSR for the Performance Period the market capitalization per share of the spun off entity will be treated as a dividend paid by the distributing company.

 MARKET STOCK UNITS 
 AWARD AGREEMENT

The Award has been granted pursuant to the Paylocity Holding Corporation 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ), as amended to the Grant Date, the provisions of which are incorporated herein by reference. This Award is intended to constitute an Award of Performance Shares described in Section 10 of the Plan. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the determination of the number of Units which vest and or are to be settled in Shares shall be determined based on the provisions contained in the Grant Notice and this Agreement, and the provisions set forth in Section 10.7(a) of the Plan (relating to certain Terminations of Service) shall not apply. 
 Unless otherwise defined herein or in the Grant Notice, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned by the Plan. 
 1. THE AWARD . 
 The Company has granted to the Participant the Award set forth in the Grant Notice, which, depending on the extent to which the Performance Measure is attained during the Performance Period, may result in the Participant earning as little as zero (0) Units or as many as the Maximum Number of Units. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, each Unit, to the extent it is earned and becomes a Vested Unit, represents a right to receive on the Settlement Date one (1) Share. Unless and until a Unit has been determined to be an Earned Unit and has vested and become a Vested Unit as set forth in the Grant Notice, the Participant will have no right to settlement of such Units. Prior to settlement of Vested Units, such Units will represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. 
 2. COMMITTEE DETERMINATION OF EARNED UNITS . 
 2.1 Level of Performance Measure Attained. As soon as practicable following completion of the Performance Period, but in any event no later than the Vesting Date, the Committee shall determine the level of attainment of the Performance Measure during the Performance Period, the resulting Relative TSR Multiplier and the number of Units which have become Earned Units. 
 2.2 Adjustment for Leave of Absence or Part-Time Work. Unless otherwise required by law or Company policy, if the Participant takes one or more unpaid leaves of absence, the Committee may, in its discretion, make such modifications to the Award as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise required by law or Company policy, if the Participant commences working on a part-time basis during the Performance Period, the Committee may, in its discretion, make such modifications to the Award as it deems appropriate. 
 3. VESTING OF EARNED UNITS . 
 3.1 Normal Vesting. Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, Earned Units shall vest and become Vested Units as provided in the Grant Notice. 
 3.2 Vesting Upon a Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, the vesting of Earned Units shall be determined in accordance with Section 9. 

4. TERMINATION OF SERVICE . 
 4.1 Death or Disability. If the Participant s Service terminates by reason of the death or Disability of the Participant either (a) before completion of the Performance Period or (b) after completion of the Performance Period but before the Vesting Date, the Participant shall not forfeit the Award. Instead, unless the Committee determines that Section 9 is applicable, the number of Earned Units and Vested Units shall be determined as follows 
 (a) If such termination of Service occurs before completion of the Performance Period, then a number of Earned Units shall be determined for a special Performance Period ending on the day of such termination of Service (the Special Performance Period ). The TSR for the Company and each Comparator Company for the Special Performance Period shall be determined as provided by Appendix A , except that the Ending Average Per Share Closing Price shall be determined for the 30 calendar days ending with the last day of the Special Performance Period. The number of Vested Units shall be determined by multiplying such number of Earned Units by the ratio of the number of days of the Participant s Service during the Special Performance Period to the number of days contained in the original Performance Period. The number of Vested Units so determined shall be settled in accordance with Section 5. The Participant shall forfeit all Units not determined to be Vested Units in accordance with this Section, and the Participant shall not be entitled to any payment therefor. 
 (b) If such termination of Service occurs after completion of the Performance Period but before the Vesting Date, then the number of Earned Units shall be determined for the Performance Period in accordance with Section 2, and all such Earned Units be deemed Vested Units upon such determination by the Committee and settled in accordance with Section 5 as if the Participant s Service had continued through the Vesting Date. 
 4.2 Other Termination of Service. In the event that the Participant s Service terminates for any reason, with or without cause, other than by reason of the death or Disability of the Participant, the Participant shall forfeit and the Company shall automatically reacquire all Units which are not, as of the time of such termination, Vested Units, and the Participant shall not be entitled to any payment therefor.

 5.1 Issuance of Shares . Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3 and Section 6 below, the Company shall issue to the Participant on the Settlement Date with respect to each Vested Unit to be settled on such date one (1) Share.

 5.2 Beneficial Ownership of Shares Certificate Registration . The Participant hereby authorizes the Company, in its sole discretion, to deposit any or all Shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to the settlement of the Award with the Company s transfer agent, including any successor transfer agent, to be held in book entry form, or to deposit such Shares for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship of which the Company has notice.

No Shares may be issued hereunder if the issuance of such Shares would constitute a violation of any applicable U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws or other laws or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any Shares subject to the Award shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the settlement of the Award, the Company may require 

the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company. Further, regardless of whether the transfer or issuance of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Units has been registered under the Securities Act or has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any State, the Company may impose additional restrictions upon the sale, pledge, or other transfer of the Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on share certificates and the issuance of stop-transfer instructions to the Company s transfer agent) if, in the judgment of the Company and the Company s counsel, such restrictions are necessary in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, the securities laws of any State, or any other law.

APPENDIX A 
 Performance Measure and Performance Multiplier 
 Applicable to Market Stock Unit Award Granted on 
 _________ 
 1. Relative TSR Percentile means the percentile (rounded to the nearest whole percentile) of the Company s TSR ranking relative to the TSRs of the Comparator Companies, determined in accordance with the following formula 
 
 Where, 
 R is an integer equal to the Company s ranking when the TSRs of the Company and the Comparator Companies are ranked from the highest to the lowest TSR, with the highest being one (1) and 
 N is equal to the number of Comparator Companies plus the Company. 
 For example, if there are 2999 Comparator Companies and the Company s TSR ranked 500 th highest among the TSRs of a group of 3000 Index Companies (i.e., the Comparator Companies plus the Company), the Relative TSR Percentile of the Company would be 83 , which is the result of (1 ((500 1) (3000-1))) x 100 (rounded to the nearest whole percentile). 
 2. TSR or Total Stockholder Return means, for the Company and each Comparator Company, the growth rate for the applicable Performance Period, expressed as a percentage (rounded to the nearest 1 100 of 1 ), in the value of one share of such company s common stock during the Performance Period due to the appreciation in the price per share and dividends paid during such period with respect to such share, assuming dividends are reinvested, calculated as follows 
 
 Where, 
 Ending Price is the Ending Average Per Share Closing Price of such company 
 Dividends are the aggregate values of all dividends paid to a stockholder of record of such company with respect to one share of common stock during the Performance Period and 
 Beginning Price is the Beginning Average Per Share Closing Price of such company. 
 3. Beginning Average Per Share Closing Price means, for the Company and each Comparator Company, the Average Per Share Closing Price for the 30 calendar days ending with the calendar day immediately preceding the first day of the Performance Period. 

4. Comparator Companies means each of the companies, other than the Company, included in the Russell 3000 Index and determined in accordance with Appendix B . 
 5. Earned Units means, with respect to each Performance Period, the number of Units (rounded up to the nearest whole Unit), if any (not to exceed the Maximum Number of Units for such Performance Period) shall be equal to the product of (i) the Target Number of Units for such Performance Period multiplied by (ii) the Relative TSR Multiplier provided, however, that if the Company s TSR for the Performance Period is a negative number, then the number of Earned Units shall not exceed 100 of the Target Number of Units. 
 6. Ending Average Per Share Closing Price means, for the Company and each Comparator Company, the Average Per Share Closing Price for the 30 calendar days ending with the last calendar day of the applicable Performance Period. 
 7. Average Per Share Closing Price means, for the Company and each Comparator Company, the volume weighted average of the daily closing prices per share of common stock of such company as reported on the national or regional securities exchange or quotation system constituting the primary market for such common stock for all trading days falling within the applicable averaging period. 
 8. Relative TSR Multiplier means a ratio determined as set forth on Appendix C . 
 The Relative TSR Percentiles serve as cliffs. For example, if Relative TSR Percentile was 59 , the Relative TSR Multiplier would be 95 . 
 
 9. Negative Company TSR . If the Company s TSR for the Performance Period is a negative number, then the number of Earned Units shall not exceed 100 of the Target Units (i.e., the Relative TSR Multiplier may not exceed 1.00), regardless of the Company s Relative TSR Percentile for the Performance Period. 

APPENDIX B 
 COMPARATOR COMPANIES 
 The Comparator Companies consist of the companies (other than the Company) included in the Russell 3000 Index as of the Grant Date. 
 If applicable during a Performane Period, a Comparator Company s TSR shall be modified during the Performance Period as follows 
 If a Comparator Company becomes bankrupt during the Performance Period, then its TSR for the Performance Period will be deemed to equal negative 100 . 
 If a Comparator Company ceases to be publicly traded for a reason other than bankruptcy during the Performance Period, then its TSR will be determined on the date immediately prior to its ceasing to be publicly traded. 
 If a Comparator Company merges during the Performance Period with another entity that is not a Comparator Company, then its TSR will be determined on the date immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. 
 If two Comparator Companies merge during the Performance Period, then (a) with respect to the acquired company, its TSR will be determined on the date immediately prior the effective time of the merger and (b) with respect to the acquiring company, its TSR will be determined as if the merger did not occur. 
 If a Comparator Company distributes a portion of its business in a spin-off transaction during the Performance Period, then in determining its TSR for the Performance Period the market capitalization per share of the spun off entity will be treated as a dividend paid by the distributing company.

 1. THE AWARD . 
 
 The Company has granted to the Participant the Award set forth in the Grant Notice, which, depending on the extent to which the Performance Measure is attained during the Performance Period, may result in the Participant earning as little as zero (0) Units or as many as the Maximum Number of Units. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, each Unit, to the extent it is earned and becomes a Vested Unit, represents a right to receive on the Settlement Date one (1) Share. Unless and until a Unit has been determined to be an Earned Unit and has vested and become a Vested Unit as set forth in the Grant Notice, the Participant will have no right to settlement of such Units. Prior to settlement of Vested Units, such Units will represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. 
 
 2. COMMITTEE DETERMINATION OF EARNED UNITS . 
 
 2.1 Level of Performance Measure Attained. As soon as practicable following completion of the Performance Period, but in any event no later than the Vesting Date, the Committee shall determine the level of attainment of the Performance Measure during the Performance Period, the resulting Relative TSR Multiplier and the number of Units which have become Earned Units. 
 
 2.2 Adjustment for Leave of Absence or Part-Time Work. Unless otherwise required by law or Company policy, if the Participant takes one or more unpaid leaves of absence, the Committee may, in its discretion, make such modifications to the Award as it deems appropriate. Unless otherwise required by law or Company policy, if the Participant commences working on a part-time basis during the Performance Period, the Committee may, in its discretion, make such modifications to the Award as it deems appropriate. 
 
 3. VESTING OF EARNED UNITS . 
 
 3.1 Normal Vesting. Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, Earned Units shall vest and become Vested Units as provided in the Grant Notice. 
 
 3.2 Vesting Upon a Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, the vesting of Earned Units shall be determined in accordance with Section 9. 

4. TERMINATION OF SERVICE . 
 
 4.1 Death or Disability. If the Participant s Service terminates by reason of the death or Disability of the Participant either (a) before completion of the Performance Period or (b) after completion of the Performance Period but before the Vesting Date, the Participant shall not forfeit the Award. Instead, unless the Committee determines that Section 9 is applicable, the number of Earned Units and Vested Units shall be determined as follows 
 
 (a) If such termination of Service occurs before completion of the Performance Period, then a number of Earned Units shall be determined for a special Performance Period ending on the day of such termination of Service (the Special Performance Period ). The TSR for the Company and each Comparator Company for the Special Performance Period shall be determined as provided by Appendix A , except that the Ending Average Per Share Closing Price shall be determined for the 30 calendar days ending with the last day of the Special Performance Period. The number of Vested Units shall be determined by multiplying such number of Earned Units by the ratio of the number of days of the Participant s Service during the Special Performance Period to the number of days contained in the original Performance Period. The number of Vested Units so determined shall be settled in accordance with Section 5. The Participant shall forfeit all Units not determined to be Vested Units in accordance with this Section, and the Participant shall not be entitled to any payment therefor. 
 
 (b) If such termination of Service occurs after completion of the Performance Period but before the Vesting Date, then the number of Earned Units shall be determined for the Performance Period in accordance with Section 2, and all such Earned Units be deemed Vested Units upon such determination by the Committee and settled in accordance with Section 5 as if the Participant s Service had continued through the Vesting Date. 
 
 4.2 Other Termination of Service. In the event that the Participant s Service terminates for any reason, with or without cause, other than by reason of the death or Disability of the Participant, the Participant shall forfeit and the Company shall automatically reacquire all Units which are not, as of the time of such termination, Vested Units, and the Participant shall not be entitled to any payment therefor. 
 
 5. SETTLEMENT OF THE AWARD . 
 
 5.1 Issuance of Shares . Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3 and Section 6 below, the Company shall issue to the Participant on the Settlement Date with respect to each Vested Unit to be settled on such date one (1) Share. Shares issued in settlement of Vested Units shall not be subject to any restriction on transfer other than any such restriction as may be required pursuant to Section 5.3. 
 
 5.2 Beneficial Ownership of Shares Certificate Registration . The Participant hereby authorizes the Company, in its sole discretion, to deposit any or all Shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to the settlement of the Award with the Company s transfer agent, including any successor transfer agent, to be held in book entry form, or to deposit such Shares for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship of which the Company has notice. Except as provided by the foregoing, a certificate for the Shares acquired by the Participant shall be registered in the name of the Participant, or, if applicable, in the names of the heirs of the Participant. 
 
 5.3 Restrictions on Grant of the Award and Issuance of Shares . The grant of the Award and issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Award shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of U.S. federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities. No Shares may be issued hereunder if the issuance of such Shares would constitute a violation of any applicable U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws or other laws or regulations or the requirements of any stock 

exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any Shares subject to the Award shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the settlement of the Award, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company. Further, regardless of whether the transfer or issuance of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Units has been registered under the Securities Act or has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any State, the Company may impose additional restrictions upon the sale, pledge, or other transfer of the Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on share certificates and the issuance of stop-transfer instructions to the Company s transfer agent) if, in the judgment of the Company and the Company s counsel, such restrictions are necessary in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, the securities laws of any State, or any other law. 
 
 5.4 Fractional Shares . The Company shall not be required to issue fractional Shares upon the settlement of the Award. 
 
 6. TAX WITHHOLDING AND ADVICE .

The Company shall have no obligation to deliver Shares until the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company have been satisfied by the Participant. 
 
 6.2 Assignment of Sale Proceeds. Subject to compliance with applicable law and the Company s Trading Compliance Policy, if permitted by the Company, the Participant may satisfy the Participating Company s tax withholding obligations in accordance with procedures established by the Company providing for delivery by the Participant to the Company or a broker approved by the Company of properly executed instructions, in a form approved by the Company, providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale with respect to some or all of the Shares being acquired upon settlement of Units. 
 
 6.3 Withholding in Shares. The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to require the Participant to satisfy all or any portion of a Participating Company s tax withholding obligations by deducting from the Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant in settlement of the Award a number of whole Shares having a fair market value, as determined by the Company as of the date on which the tax withholding obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such tax withholding obligations determined by the applicable statutory withholding rates. 
 
 6.4 Tax Advice . The Participant represents, warrants and acknowledges that the Company has made no warranties or representations to the Participant with respect to the income tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Participant is in no manner relying on the Company or the Company s representatives for an assessment of such tax consequences. THE PARTICIPANT UNDERSTANDS THAT THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. THE PARTICIPANT SHOULD CONSULT HIS OR HER OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE UNITS.
