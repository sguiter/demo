 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

subsidiary, Puma Biotechnology, B.V., a Netherlands company. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
 
 The Company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception. While the Company has previously reported net income, we cannot assure that we will continue to do so and will need to continue to generate significant revenue to sustain operations and successfully commercialize neratinib. In 2017 , the Company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approval for its first product, NERLYNX (neratinib), formerly known as PB272 (neratinib, oral), for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage HER2 -overexpressed/amplified breast cancer following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. Following FDA approval in July 2017 , NERLYNX became available by prescription in the United States, and the Company commenced commercialization. 
 
 In February 2020, NERLYNX was also approved by the FDA in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti- HER2 -based regimens in the metastatic setting. 
 
 In 2018, the European Commission EC granted marketing authorization for NERLYNX in the EU for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage hormone receptor positive HER2 -overexpressed/amplified breast cancer and who are less than one year from the completion of prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. 
 
 The Company is required to make substantial payments to Pfizer upon the achievement of certain milestones and has contractual obligations for clinical trial contracts. 
 
 The Company has entered into other exclusive sub-license agreements with various parties to pursue regulatory approval, if necessary, and commercialize NERLYNX, if approved, in many regions outside the United States, including Europe (excluding Russia and Ukraine), Australia, Canada, China, Southeast Asia, Israel, South Korea, and various countries and territories in Central America, South America, Africa and the Middle East. The Company plans to continue to pursue commercialization of NERLYNX in other countries outside the United States, if approved. 
 
 In September 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited Takeda to license the worldwide research and development and commercial rights to alisertib, a selective, small-molecule, orally administered inhibitor of aurora kinase A. 
 
 The Company has reported net income of approximately million and cash provided by operations of approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The Company s commercialization, research and development or marketing efforts may require funding in addition to the cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately million at September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and proceeds that will become available to the Company through product sales and sub-license payments are sufficient to satisfy its operating cash needs, including amounts due under the Company s Note Purchase Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities IV Co-Invest 1 LP Athyrium (see Note 9 Debt ), for at least one year after the filing of the Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q in which these financial statements are included. The Company continues to remain dependent on its ability to obtain sufficient funding to sustain operations and continue to successfully commercialize neratinib in the United States. While the Company has been successful in raising capital in the past, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future. The Company s ability to obtain funding may be adversely impacted by uncertain market and economic condition s, including th e Company s success in commercializing neratinib and unfavorable decisions of regulatory authorities or adverse clinical trial results. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time. Additionally, the terms of the Company s Note Purchase Agreement place restrictions on the Company s ability to operate the business and on the Company s financial flexibility, and the Company may be unable to achieve the revenue necessary to satisfy the minimum revenue and cash balance covenants as specified in the agreement. 
 
 Since its inception through September 30, 2024, the Company s financing has primarily consisted of proceeds from product, royalty and license revenue, public offerings of its common stock, private equity placements, and various debt instruments. 
 
 In the opinion of management, the included disclosures are adequate, and the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of our consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024 . Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from audited annual financial statements but does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the audited annual financial statements. The condensed consolidated results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 .

Product Revenue, Net: 
 
 The Company sells NERLYNX to a limited number of specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors in the United States. These customers subsequently resell the Company s products to patients and certain medical centers or hospitals. In addition to distribution agreements with these customers, the Company enters into arrangements with health care providers and payors that provide for government mandated and/or privately negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of the Company s products. 
 
 The Company recognizes revenue on product sales when the specialty pharmacy or specialty distributor, as applicable, obtains control of the Company s product, which occurs at a point in time (upon delivery). Product revenue is recorded net of applicable reserves for variable consideration, including discounts and allowances. The Company s payment terms range between 10 and 68 days. 
 
 Product revenue also consists of product sales under sub-license agreements to our sub-licensees, who then sell into their respective international territories. 
 
 Shipping and handling costs for product shipments occur prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods and are recorded in cost of sales. 
 
 If taxes should be collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities, they will be excluded from revenue. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that the Company would have recognized is one year or less. However, no such costs were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Reserves for Variable Consideration: 
 
 Revenue from product sales is recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established. Components of variable consideration include trade discounts and allowances, product returns, provider chargebacks and discounts, government rebates, payor rebates, and other incentives, such as voluntary patient assistance, and other allowances that are offered within contracts between the Company and its customers, payors, and other indirect customers relating to the Company s sale of its products. These reserves, as detailed below, are based on the related sales, and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable, net when the right of offset exists in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU ASU 2013 - 1, Balance Sheet (Topic 210 ): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, or as a current liability. These estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted in accordance with the expected value method in ASC 606 for relevant factors such as current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect the Company s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the respective underlying contracts. 
 
 The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur in a future period. The Company s analyses also contemplated application of the constraint in accordance with the guidance, under which it determined a significant reversal of revenue would not be probable to occur in a future period for the estimates detailed below as of September 30, 2024 , and, therefore, the transaction price was not reduced further during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 . Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company s estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the Company s estimates, the Company will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. 
 
 Trade Discounts and Allowances: 
 
 The Company generally provides customers with discounts, which include incentive fees that are explicitly stated in the Company s contracts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. The reserve for discounts is established in the same period that the related revenue is recognized, together with reductions to accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company compensates its customers for sales order management, data, and distribution services. The Company has determined such services received to date are not distinct from the Company s sale of products to its customers and, therefore, these payments have been recorded as a reduction of revenue within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Product Returns: 
 
 Consistent with industry practice, the Company offers the specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors that are its customers limited product return rights for damaged and expiring product, provided it is within a specified period around the product expiration date as set forth in the applicable individual distribution agreement. The Company estimates the amount of its product sales that may be returned by its customers and records this estimate as a reduction of product revenue, net in the period the related product revenue is recognized, as well as a reduction to accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company currently estimates product returns using its own sales information, including its visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel. The Company has an insignificant amount of returns to date and believes that returns of its products will continue to be minimal. 
 
 Provider Chargebacks and Discounts: 
 
 Chargebacks for fees and discounts to providers represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to its customers who directly purchase the product from the Company. Customers charge the Company for the difference between what they pay for the product and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. The reserve for chargebacks is established in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue, net and a reduction to accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider by customers, and the Company generally issues credits for such amounts within a few weeks of the customer s notification to the Company of the resale. Chargebacks consist of credits the Company expects to issue for units that remain in the distribution channel at each reporting period-end that the Company expects will be sold to qualified healthcare providers and chargebacks that customers have claimed, but for which the Company has not yet issued a payment. 

Government Rebates: 
 
 The Company is subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and Medicare. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue, net and the establishment of a current liability, which is included in accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company s liability for these rebates consists of invoices received for claims from prior quarters that have not been paid or for which an invoice has not yet been received, estimates of claims for the current quarter, and estimates of future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue, but which remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. 
 
 Payor Rebates: 
 
 The Company contracts with certain private payor organizations, primarily insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of its products. The Company estimates these rebates and records such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue, net and the establishment of a current liability, which is included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Other Incentives: 
 
 Other incentives the Company offers include voluntary patient assistance programs, such as the co-pay assistance program, which are intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payors. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that the Company expects to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. The adjustments are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability, which is included as a component of accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 License Revenue: 
 
 The Company also recognizes license revenue under certain of the Company s sub-license agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606. The terms of these agreements may contain multiple performance obligations, which may include licenses and research and development activities. The Company evaluates these agreements under ASC 606 to determine the distinct performance obligations. Non-refundable, upfront fees that are not contingent on any future performance and require no consequential continuing involvement by the Company, are recognized as revenue when the license term commences and the licensed data, technology or product is delivered. The Company defers recognition of non-refundable upfront license fees if the performance obligations are not satisfied. 
 
 Prior to recognizing revenue, the Company makes estimates of the transaction price, including variable consideration that is subject to a constraint. Amounts of variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. 
 
 If there are multiple distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price is generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost-plus margin. Revenue is recognized by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligations using an input measure. 
 
 Since 2018, the Company has entered into sub-license agreements with certain sub-licensees in territories outside of the United States. These sub-licensing agreements grant certain intellectual property rights and set forth various obligations with respect to actions such as development, pursuit and maintenance of regulatory approvals, commercialization and supply of NERLYNX in the sub-licensees respective territories. 
 
 License fees under the sub-license agreements include one -time upfront payments when each sub-license agreement was executed and potential additional one -time milestone payments due to the Company upon successful completion of certain performance obligations, such as achieving regulatory approvals or sales target thresholds, and potential double-digit royalties on sales of the licensed product, calculated as a percentage of net sales of the licensed product throughout each sub-licensee s respective territory. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 the total potential milestone payments that would be due to the Company upon achievement of all respective performance obligations under the sub-license agreements is approximately million. A t this time, the Company cannot estimate if or when these milestone-related performance obligations might be achieved. 
 
 In September 2024, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee approved a change in existing post approval requirements for overall results and a reduction in sample size for the Pierre Fabre NERLYFE post-marketing study in Europe . As of September 30, 2024, there is a post-marketing liability of million, and the final costs of the study are being assessed. Any adjustment to the liability will be recorded as license revenue as the original million estimate in study costs were recorded as a reduction to license revenue. 
 
 Royalty Revenue: 
 
 For sub-license agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when the related sales occur in accordance with the sales-based royalty exception under ASC 606 - 10 - 55 - 65. 
 
 Royalty revenue consists of consideration earned related to international sales of NERLYNX made by the Company s sub-licensees in their respective territories. The Company recognizes royalty revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. Royalty revenue was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Royalty Expenses: 
 
 Royalties incurred in connection with the Company s license agreement with Pfizer, as disclosed in Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies, are expensed to cost of sales as revenue from product sales is recognized. 

Warrants : 
 
 Warrants (see Note 10 Stockhol ders Eq uity) granted to employees and nonemployees are valued at the fair value of the instrument on the grant date and are recognized in the condensed statement of operations over the requisite service period. When the requisite service period precedes the grant date and a market condition exists in the warrant, the Company values the warrant using the Monte Carlo Simulation Method. When the terms of the warrant become fixed, the Company values the warrant using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Method. As allowed by ASC 718, the Company s estimate of expected volatility is based on its average volatilities using its publicly traded history. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the warrant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant valuation. In determining the value of the warrant until the terms are fixed, the Company factors in the probability of the market condition occurring and several possible scenarios. When the requisite service period precedes the grant date and is deemed to be complete, the Company records the fair value of the warrant at the time of issuance as an equity stock-based compensation transaction. The grant date is determined when all pertinent information, such as exercise price and quantity are known. Compensation expense related to warrant modification is measured based on the fair value of the warrant as of the modification date. Any incremental compensation expense arising from the excess of the fair value of the warrant on the modification date compared to the fair value of the warrant immediately before the modification date is recognized at the modification date or ratably over the requisite service period, as appropriate.

million. The Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk due to the nature of the financial instruments in which the money is held. Pursuant to the Company s internal investment policy, investments must be rated A- 1/P - 1 or better by Standard and Poor s Rating Service and Moody s Investors Service at the time of purchase. 

The Company sells its products in the United States primarily through specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors. Therefore, wholesale distributors and large pharmacy chains account for a large portion of its accounts receivables, net and product revenues, net. The creditworthiness of its customers is continuously monitored, and the Company has internal policies regarding customer credit limits. The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on the creditworthiness of its customers, historical payment patterns, aging of receivable balances and general economic conditions. 
 
 The Company also sells its products to international customers through sub-licensees. Royalty revenue consists of consideration earned related to international sales of NERLYNX made by the Company s sub-licensees in their respective territories. A majority of the Company's royalty revenue is generated from sales into the China market. 
 
 The Company s success depends on its ability to successfully commercialize NERLYNX. The Company currently has a single product and limited commercial sales experience, which makes it difficult to evaluate its current business, predict its future prospects and forecast financial performance and growth. The Company has invested a significant portion of its efforts and financial resources in the development and commercialization of the lead product, NERLYNX, and expects NERLYNX to constitute the vast majority of product revenue for the foreseeable future. 
 
 The Company relies exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture NERLYNX and its drug candidates. The commercialization of NERLYNX and any other drug candidates, if approved, could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to provide sufficient quantities of product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices. The Company has no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and does not intend to establish its own manufacturing facilities. While the drug candidates were being developed by Pfizer, both the drug substance and drug product were manufactured by third -party contractors. The Company is using the same third -party contractors to manufacture, supply, store and distribute drug supplies for clinical trials and the commercialization of NERLYNX and intends to use third party contractors to manufacture, supply, store and distribute drug supplies for its clinical trials of alisertib. If the Company is unable to continue its relationships with one or more of these third -party contractors, it could experience delays in the development or commercialization efforts as it locates and qualifies new manufacturers.

Leases will be classified as financing or operating, which will drive the expense recognition pattern. The Company elects to exclude short-term leases if and when the Company has them. For additional information, see Note 5 Leases. 
 
 The Company leases office space and copy machines, all of which are operating leases. Most leases include the option to renew, and the exercise of the renewal options is at the Company s sole discretion. Options to extend or terminate a lease are considered in the lease term to the extent that the option is reasonably certain of exercise. The leases do not include options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term. Covenants imposed by the leases include letters of credit required to be obtained by the lessee. 
 
 The incremental borrowing rate IBR represents the rate of interest the Company would expect to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. When determinable, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to determine the present value of lease payments. As the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company s average IBR for existing leases as of September 30, 2024 is .

 The Company assesses its intangible assets for impairment if indicators are present or changes in circumstance suggest that impairment may exist. Events that could result in an impairment, or trigger an interim impairment assessment, include the receipt of additional clinical or nonclinical data regarding one of the Company s drug candidates or a potentially competitive drug candidate, changes in the clinical development program for a drug candidate, or new information regarding potential sales for the drug. If impairment indicators are present or changes in circumstance suggest that impairment may exist, the Company performs a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows of each intangible asset to its carrying value on the consolidated balance sheet. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the carrying value, the Company would determine the fair value of the intangible asset and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. In connection with the FDA approval of NERLYNX in July 2017, the Company triggered a one -time milestone payment pursuant to its license agreement with Pfizer. In June 2020, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Pfizer relating to the method of payment associated with a milestone payment under the Company s license agreement with Pfizer (see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies). In addition, the Company reached a commercial milestone by achieving aggregate worldwide net sales of 2 50.0 million in calendar year 2022, resulting in a payment to Pfizer of million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The Company capitalized the milestones as intangible assets and is amortizing the assets to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the licensed patent through 2030. The Company recorded amortization expense related to its intangible assets of approximately million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 estimated future amortization expense related to the Company s intangible assets is approximately million for the remainder of 2024 and 9.7 million for each year starting 2025 through 2029, and million for 2030.

Total rent expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately million and million, respectively. Total rent expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately million and million, respectively. For purposes of determining straight-line rent expense, the lease term is calculated from the date the Company first takes possession of the facility, including any periods of free rent and any renewal option periods that the Company is reasonably certain of exercising. The Company s office leases generally have contractually specified minimum rent and annual rent increases that are included in the measurement of the ROU asset and related lease liability. Additionally, under these lease arrangements, the Company may be required to pay directly, or reimburse the lessors, for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs. Such amounts are generally variable and therefore not included in the measurement of the ROU asset and related lease liability but are instead recognized as variable lease expense in selling, general and administrative costs in the condensed consolidated statements of operations when they are incurred.

Athyrium Note Purchase Agreement: 
 
 The Company issued senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of million pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated July 23, 2021 by the Company, and its subsidiaries, and Athyrium, as Administrative Agent, and certain other investor parties (the Note Purchase Agreement ), with an initial maturity date of July 23, 2026 the Athyrium Notes ). The Athyrium Notes were issued for face amount of million net of an original issue discount of million. The Athyrium Notes also require a exit payment to be made on each payment of principal. The borrowings under the Athyrium Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the Company s outstanding indebtedness, including the applicable exit and prepayment fees owed to lenders under its Oxford Credit Facility. The Athyrium Notes are secured by substantially all of the Company s assets. The Company incurred million of deferred financing costs with the borrowing. 
 
 Interest on the Athyrium Notes is calculated in part based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), which replaced the London Interbank Offering Rate as the floating benchmark for interest rate calculations applicable to the Athyrium Notes pursuant to the terms of the Third Amendment to Note Purchase Agreement dated as of September 16, 2022 the Third Amendment ). The modification of the Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to the Third Amendment did not meet the requirements of a debt extinguishment under ASC Topic 470 - 50 - Debt Modifications and Exchanges and no gain or loss was recognized. The Company performed a quantitative analysis and determined that the terms of the new debt and original debt instrument were not substantially different. Accordingly, the Third Amendment is accounted for as a debt modification. 
 
 Following the effectiveness of the Third Amendment, the Athyrium Notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) eight percent plus (b) the lesser of (i) the sum of x three -month term SOFR for an interest period of three months plus (y) basis points) and (ii) three and one -half of one percent per annum.

The Company capitalized the milestones as intangible assets and is amortizing the assets to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the licensed patent through 2030. Should the Company commercialize any more of the compounds licensed from Pfizer or any products containing any of these compounds, the Company will be obligated to pay to Pfizer annual royalties at a fixed rate in the low-to-mid teens of net sales of all such products, subject to certain reductions and offsets in some circumstances. The Company s royalty obligation continues, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the later of 1 the last to expire licensed patent covering the applicable licensed product in such country, or 2 the earlier of generic competition for such licensed product reaching a certain level in such country or expiration of a certain time period after first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. In the event that the Company sub-licenses the rights granted to the Company under the license agreement with Pfizer to a third party, the same milestone and royalty payments are required. The Company can terminate the license agreement at will, or for safety concerns, in each case upon specified advance notice.

 Patent-Related Proceedings 
 
 AstraZeneca Litigation 
 
 On September 22, 2021, the Company filed suit against AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP, AstraZeneca AB, and AstraZeneca PLC for infringement of United States Patent Nos. 10,603,314 the 314 patent and 10,596,162 the 162 patent ( Puma Biotechnology, Inc. et al. v. AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP et al ., 1:21CV01338 (D. Del. Sep. 22, 2021)). The Company s complaint alleges that AstraZeneca s commercial manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale, distribution, and/or importation of Tagrisso (osimertinib) products for the treatment of gefitinib and/or erlotinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer infringes the 314 and 162 patents. The Company is an exclusive licensee of the 314 and 162 patents under the Pfizer Agreement. Wyeth is a co-plaintiff. Plaintiffs seek a judgment that AstraZeneca s product infringes the asserted patents and an award of monetary damages in an amount to be proven at trial. AstraZeneca AB and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP filed an answer and counterclaims on November 5, 2021, including claims challenging the asserted patents as not infringed and/or invalid, and accusing plaintiffs of unclean hands and patent misuse. The parties stipulated to dismiss AstraZeneca PLC as a defendant and Pfizer as a Counterclaim Defendant on December 10, 2021, which the Court so ordered on December 13, 2021. The Company filed its answer to AstraZeneca s counterclaims on December 17, 2021, denying those claims. The case was reassigned to visiting Judge Matthew Kennelly of the Northern District of Illinois. A Markman Hearing was conducted on March 17, 2023, and the Court issued its claim construction decision on March 29, 2023. Fact discovery closed on May 19, 2023, and expert discovery closed on November 17, 2023. The Court denied the parties respective motions for summary judgment and Daubert motions, other than to clarify that Plaintiffs damages cannot extend to any time period before the asserted patents were issued. The Court granted AstraZeneca s motion to dismiss the Company as a Plaintiff on constitutional standing grounds but denied the motion to dismiss Wyeth as a Plaintiff on constitutional standing grounds. On April 29, 2024, the Court granted AstraZeneca s motion to dismiss AstraZeneca s counterclaims against the Company, which removed the Company from the case. Wyeth remained in the case as a Plaintiff and counterclaim-defendant. Under the Company s worldwide exclusive license agreement with Pfizer, Inc. (the parent of Wyeth) as amended, the Company also maintains contractual rights to recover monetary damages in the AstraZeneca litigation, and those contractual rights are unaffected by the court s March 18, 2024 and April 29, 2024 orders. A jury trial was held May 13- 17, 2024. The jury found in favor of Wyeth and against AstraZeneca. In particular, the jury found that use of Tagrisso according to each of the three FDA-approved indications infringes the asserted claims of the 314 and 162 patents, and that AstraZeneca induces that infringement. The jury further rejected AstraZeneca s challenges to the validity of the patents, finding that they are not invalid. The jury awarded damages to Wyeth for past acts of infringement through December 31, 2023, in the amount of . A separate bench trial related to certain equitable claims and defenses raised by AstraZeneca was held before Judge Kennelly on June 20 and 25, 2024. On August 6, 2024, Judge Kennelly issued his ruling on the issues that were tried in the bench trial, finding for Wyeth and against AstraZeneca on all claims and defenses. The Court found that AstraZeneca had not proved its claim that Wyeth s asserted patents were invalid as indefinite, or that Wyeth had committed acts that would give rise to findings of unclean hands, implied waiver, or patent misuse. AstraZeneca has filed a motion challenging the jury s verdict and requesting a new trial. Wyeth has filed a motion requesting supplemental damages for past infringement from January 1, 2024, through the date of judgment; pre-and-post judgment interest, and ongoing royalties through the remaining term of the patents. Briefing on these motions from both sides was completed on July 16, 2024. On August 14, 2024, Judge Kennelly ruled on AstraZeneca s motion challenging the jury s verdict, granting it in part and denying it in part. The Court granted AstraZeneca s motion for judgment as a matter of law that the '314 and '162 patents are invalid under 35 U.S.C. 112 for lacking enablement and adequate written description as to a particular claim limitation. In all other respects, the Court denied AstraZeneca s motion. The Court entered its final and appealable judgment accordingly. The Company respectfully disagrees with the Court s ruling regarding invalidity with respect to the particular claim limitation. Wyeth filed a notice of appeal on September 12, 2024 appealing the District Court s judgment as a matter of law, as well as other rulings and opinions of the Court adverse to Wyeth.

Item 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, (this Quarterly Report ). The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Unless otherwise provided in this Quarterly Report, references to the Company, we, us, and our refer to Puma Biotechnology, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its wholly owned subsidiary. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes innovative products to enhance cancer care and improve treatment outcomes for patients. We are currently commercializing NERLYNX , an oral version of neratinib, for the treatment of certain HER2-positive breast cancers. Additionally, in 2022, we in-licensed and became responsible for the global development and commercialization of alisertib. Alisertib is a selective, small-molecule inhibitor of aurora kinase A that is designed to disrupt mitosis leading to apoptosis of rapidly proliferating tumor cells that are dependent on aurora kinase A. Prior to our licensing alisertib from Takeda, alisertib was tested in over 1,300 patients who were treated across 22 company-sponsored trials resulting in a large, well-characterized clinical safety database. Based on information in this database, we believe alisertib has potential application in the treatment of a range of different cancer types, including hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and small cell lung cancer. We intend to pursue development of alisertib initially in small cell lung cancer and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. 
 
 NERLYNX is currently approved in the United States for two indications: the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy and for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. 
 
 We currently market NERLYNX in the United States using our direct specialty sales force consisting of approximately 38 sales specialists. Our sales specialists are supported by an experienced sales leadership team consisting of several regional business leaders and a VP of sales as well as experienced professionals in marketing, managed markets, access and reimbursement, market research, and sales planning and operations. Outside the United States, we seek to enter into exclusive sub-license agreements with third parties to pursue regulatory approval, if necessary, and commercialize NERLYNX, if approved. As of September 30, 2024, N ERLYNX has received approval for the treatment of certain patients with extended adjuvant or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in over 40 countries outside the United States. We are currently party to several sub-licenses in various regions outside the United States, including Europe (excluding Russia and Ukraine), Australia, Canada, China, Southeast Asia, Israel, South Korea, and various countries and territories in Central America, South America, Africa and the Middle East. 
 
 In September 2022, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda to license the worldwide research and development and commercial rights to alisertib. Alisertib is an investigational, reversible, ATP-competitive inhibitor that is designed to be highly selective for aurora kinase A. Inhibition of aurora kinase A can lead to disruption of mitotic spindle apparatus assembly, disruption of chromosome segregation, and inhibition of cell proliferation. In clinical trials to date, alisertib has shown single agent activity and activity in combination with other cancer drugs in the treatment of many different types of cancers, including hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer. We initiated the ALISertib in CAncer (ALISCA -Lung1) Phase II trial (PUMA-ALI-4201) of alisertib monotherapy for the treatment of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer in February 2024, and we plan to commence the ALISCA -Breast1 Phase II trial (PUMA-ALI-1201) in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 . 
 Under the terms of the exclusive license agreement, we assumed sole responsibility for the global development and commercialization of alisertib. We paid Takeda an upfront license fee of 7.0 million in October 2022, and it is eligible to receive potential future milestone payments of up to 287.3 million upon our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones over the course of the exclusive license agreement, as well as tiered royalty payments for any net sales of alisertib. We recorded in-process research and development expense of 7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 in connection with the up-front payment related to the asset acquisition. As of September 30, 2024, no milestones had been accrued as the underlying contingencies were not probable or estimable. 
 
 Our expenses to date have been related to hiring staff, commencing company-sponsored clinical trials and the build out of our corporate infrastructure and, since 2017, the commercial launch of NERLYNX. Accordingly, our success depends not only on the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, but also on our ability to finance product development. To date, our major sources of working capital have been proceeds from product and license revenue, public offerings of our common stock, proceeds from our credit facility and sales of our common stock in private placements. We intend to satisfy our near-term liquidity requirements through a combination of our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, and proceeds that will become available to us through product sales, royalties and sub-license milestone payments. However, this intention is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. Changes may occur that would consume our available capital faster than anticipated, including changes in and progress of our development activities, the impact of commercialization efforts, acquisitions of additional drug candidates and changes in regulation. Some of these developments have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our revenue and thus could have an adverse effect on our ability to satisfy the minimum revenue and cash balance covenants contained in the Athyrium Notes. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 As of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report, we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from our accounting policies at December 31, 2023, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 Total revenue: 
 
 Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 171.4 million, compared to 163.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in total revenue was primarily due to an increase of 17.1 million in royalty revenue offset by a decrease of 9.1 million in product revenue, net. 
 
 Product revenue, net: 
 
 Product revenue, net was approximately 140.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 149.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in product revenue, net was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately 12.5 in bottles of NERLYNX sold compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and an increase of approximately 2.1 in related dedu ctions to gross revenue for variable consideration compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by an increase in net selling price and an increase in product sales to our China sub-licensee compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Royalty revenue: 
 
 Royalty revenue was approximately 30.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to approximately 13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in royalty revenue related to the timing of sales made to China by our sub-licensee. In 2024, the sales made to China by our sub-licensee were primarily in the third quarter, while such sales in 2023 were primarily made in the fourth quarter. 
 
 Cost of sales: 
 
 Cost of sales was approximately 50.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to approximately 38.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in royalty expense and other product costs related to the timing of sales made to China by our sub-licensee.

On October 26, 2023, we implemented a reduction in our workforce of approximately 5 across the Company. We incurred approximately 0.4 million in related costs, which include severance payments and insurance premiums. These costs were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. All payments related to this plan were paid as of March 31, 2024. 
 
 Operating Activities: 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.3 million and consisted of net income of approximately 11.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items of approximately 15.1 million , including stock-based compensation of 6.5 million, depreciation and amortization of 8.7 million and provision for credit loss of 0.1 million. Total changes in cash flows from operations were due to a decrease in working capital, primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable of approximately 6.7 million (primarily sales to China) and a decrease in accrued expenses and other of approximately 2.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in inventory of 4.4 million (primarily sales to China) and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other of 2.4 million. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 16.6 million and consisted of net income of approximately 9.3 million, offset by a decrease of approximately 17.6 million of non-cash items. These non-cash items included stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, provision for credit loss and loss on impairment of asset. In addition, there were decreases in cash flows from operations due to a decrease in accrued expenses and other of approximately 18.9 million, which included an 8.0 million payment related to the Eshelman litigation settlement, net, a decrease of 3.3 million in variable consideration and 2.5 million in the employee bonus accrual, and a net decrease of 4.0 million in our Pfizer royalty accrual. Additional decreases in cash flows were due to a decrease in our post-marketing commitment liability of approximately 0.7 million, a decrease of 1.4 million in accounts payable and an increase of 1.2 million in inventory. These decreases in cash flows were partially offset by increases in cash flows due to a decrease of 10.9 million in accounts receivable from collections and a decrease of 1.4 million in prepaid and other expenses. The decrease of 0.4 million in other current assets was due to receipt of CARES Act funds, partially offset by an increase of a 1.7 million receivable from a vendor related to damaged inventory. 
 
 Investing Activities: 
 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 18.1 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of approximately 11.0 million for the same period in 2023 . Cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of available-for-sale securities of approximately 61.0 million, offset by the maturity of available-for-sale securities of approximately 42.9 million. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 11.0 million. Cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of the intangible asset of 12.5 million, and the purchase of available-for-sale securities of approximately 12.5 million, offset by the maturity of available-for-sale securities of approximately 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities: 
 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 22.5 million. Of this amount, 22.7 million related to the payment of principal, as well as exit fees, on our debt with Athyrium, partially offset by approximately 0.2 million of proceeds from employee stock options exercised. 
 
 There was no cash provided by or used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Athyrium Note Purchase Agreement: 
 
 We issued senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of 100.0 million pursuant to the note purchase agreement dated July 23, 2021, by us, and our subsidiaries, and Athyrium, as Administrative Agent, and certain other investor parties (the Note Purchase Agreement ), with an initial maturity date of July 23, 2026 (the Athyrium Notes ). The Athyrium Notes were issued for face amount of 100.0 million net of an original issue discount of 1.5 million. The Athyrium Notes also require a 2.0 exit payment to be made on each payment of principal. The borrowings under the Athyrium Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay our outstanding indebtedness, including the applicable exit and prepayment fees owed to lenders under our prior Oxford Credit Facility. The Athyrium Notes are secured by substantially all of our assets. We incurred 1.9 million of deferred financing costs with the initial borrowing of the Athyrium Notes.

Table of Contents 

Interest on the Athyrium Notes is calculated in part based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), which replaced the London Interbank Offering Rate as the floating benchmark for interest rate calculations applicable to the Athyrium Notes pursuant to the terms of the Third Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement dated as of September 16, 2022 (the Third Amendment ). The modification of the Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to the Third Amendment did not meet the requirements of a debt extinguishment under ASC 470-50 - Debt Modifications and Exchanges and no gain or loss was recognized. We performed a quantitative analysis and determined that the terms of the new debt and original debt instrument are not substantially different. Accordingly, the Third Amendment is accounted for as a debt modification. 
 
 Following the effectiveness of the Third Amendment, the Athyrium Notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) eight percent (8.00 plus (b) the lesser of (i) the sum of (x) three-month term SOFR for an interest period of three months plus (y) 0.26161 (26.161 basis points) and (ii) three and one-half of one percent (3.50 per annum. Interest is payable quarterly on the last business day of March, June, September and December each year. In the second quarter of 2024, we began paying the principal payments required to be made quarterly at 11.11 of the original face amount. The remaining balance will be paid at maturity. Each principal payment also includes a 2.0 exit payment. Each quarterly principal payment approximates 11.1 million, and each quarterly exit fee payment approximates 0.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate for the loan was 12.99 . 
 
 At our option, we may prepay the outstanding principal balance of the notes in whole or in part, subject to a prepayment fee of 2.0 of the amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs on or prior to the second anniversary of the issuance date of such notes, plus the present value of remaining interest that would have accrued through and including the second anniversary date, and 2.0 of the amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs after the second anniversary but on or prior to the third anniversary of the issuance date of such notes. 
 
 The Athyrium Notes include affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports, maintain insurance coverage, and satisfy certain requirements regarding deposit accounts. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on our transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, selling assets and suffering a change in control, in each case subject to certain exceptions. We are also required to maintain minimum cash balances and ach ieve certain minimum product revenue targets, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter on a trailing year-to-date basis. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the principal balance outstanding under the Athyrium Notes was 77.8 million representing all of our debt. We are in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Athyrium Notes. 
 
 Current and Future Financing Needs: 
 
 We did not receive or record any product revenue until the third quarter of 2017. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development efforts, our clinical trials, our R D efforts and our commercialization efforts. 
 
 We may choose to begin new R D efforts, or we may choose to launch additional marketing efforts. For example, we in-licensed alisertib from Takeda in 2022 and assumed sole responsibility for its global development and commercialization. These efforts will require funding in addition to the cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately 67.3 million and approximately 29.5 million in marketable securities available at September 30, 2024. While our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, we may incur significant losses in the future and will need to generate significant revenue to sustain operations and successfully commercialize neratinib and develop alisertib. While we have been successful in raising financing in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. Our ability to obtain funding may be adversely impacted by uncertain market conditions, our success in commercializing neratinib, our success in developing alisertib, unfavorable decisions of regulatory authorities or adverse clinical trial results. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, and proceeds that will become available to us through product sales and sub-license payments are sufficient to satisfy our operating cash and capital needs for at least one year after the filing of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 In addition, we have based our estimate of capital needs on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. Changes may occur that would consume our available capital faster than anticipated , including changes in and progress of our development activities, the impact of commercialization efforts, acquisitions of additional drug candidates and changes in regulation. Po tential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of equity or debt and other sources of funds. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements. If we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able to obtain financing when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan. As a result, we may have to significantly limit our operations, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed. In such an event, we will be required to undertake a thorough review of our programs, and the opportunities presented by such programs, and allocate our resources in the manner most prudent. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to our operating results, as calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP we use certain non-GAAP financial measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our operational performance. The following table presents our net (loss) income and net (loss) income per share, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, as adjusted to remove the impact of stock-based compensation. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation represented approximately 7.0 and 6.3 of our operating expenses, respectively, compared to 7.4 and 7.3 for the same respective periods in 2023, in each case excluding cost of sales. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to enhance understanding of our financial performance, are more indicative of our operational performance and facilitate a better comparison among fiscal periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP reporting measures.

Item 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Some of the securities that we invest in have market risk in that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the cash equivalents to fluctuate. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. We invested our excess cash primarily in cash equivalents such as money market investments as of September 30, 2024. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to ensure liquidity and to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our cash and cash equivalents without significantly increasing risk. Additionally, we established guidelines regarding approved investments and maturities of investments, which are designed to maintain safety and liquidity. 
 
 Because of the short-term maturities of our cash equivalents, we do not believe that a 10 increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the realized value of our cash equivalents. 
 
 We also have interest rate exposure as a result of borrowings outstanding under the Athyrium Notes. As of September 30, 2024 the aggregate outstanding principal amounts of the Athyrium Notes was 77.8 million. The Athyrium Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 8.00 plus the adjusted three-month term SOFR and the lesser of (a) the sum of (i) three-month term SOFR and (ii) 0.26161 (26.161 basis points) and (b) three and one-half of one percent (3.50 per annum. If overall interest rates had increased by one hundred basis points during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , our interest expense would have increased by 0.8 million. 

Item 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)), as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et al . in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.

The Company is seeking recovery of the entire amount awarded in Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et al . and all legal fees and expenses incurred in appealing from the judgment and retrying the damages phase of the trial. On November 23, 2020, the defendant filed an answer to the complaint denying the allegations of negligence. On August 19, 2022, the Company filed a voluntary dismissal of the legal malpractice action, without prejudice, to allow the Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et al . to conclude before proceedings. On June 2, 2023, the Company re-filed the lawsuit against Hedrick Gardner Kincheloe Garofalo, L.L.P. and David L. Levy, the attorneys who previously represented the Company in Eshelman v. Puma Biotechnology, Inc., et al. in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. On August 22, 2023, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the case. These motions were presented at a hearing on February 20, 2024. The Superior Court Judge granted the motions to dismiss on March 20, 2024. The Company appealed this ruling to the North Carolina Court of Appeals. 
 
 Patent-Related Proceedings 
 
 AstraZeneca Litigation 
 
 On September 22, 2021, the Company filed suit against AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP, AstraZeneca AB, and AstraZeneca PLC for infringement of United States Patent Nos. 10,603,314 the 314 patent and 10,596,162 the 162 patent ( Puma Biotechnology, Inc. et al. v. AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP et al ., 1:21CV01338 (D. Del. Sep. 22, 2021)). The Company s complaint alleges that AstraZeneca s commercial manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale, distribution, and/or importation of Tagrisso (osimertinib) products for the treatment of gefitinib and/or erlotinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer infringes the 314 and 162 patents. The Company is an exclusive licensee of the 314 and 162 patents under the Pfizer Agreement. Wyeth is a co-plaintiff. Plaintiffs seek a judgment that AstraZeneca s product infringes the asserted patents and an award of monetary damages in an amount to be proven at trial. AstraZeneca AB and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP filed an answer and counterclaims on November 5, 2021, including claims challenging the asserted patents as not infringed and/or invalid, and accusing plaintiffs of unclean hands and patent misuse. The parties stipulated to dismiss AstraZeneca PLC as a defendant and Pfizer as a Counterclaim Defendant on December 10, 2021, which the Court so ordered on December 13, 2021. The Company filed its answer to AstraZeneca s counterclaims on December 17, 2021, denying those claims. The case was reassigned to visiting Judge Matthew Kennelly of the Northern District of Illinois. A Markman Hearing was conducted on March 17, 2023, and the Court issued its claim construction decision on March 29, 2023. Fact discovery closed on May 19, 2023, and expert discovery closed on November 17, 2023. The Court denied the parties respective motions for summary judgment and Daubert motions, other than to clarify that Plaintiffs damages cannot extend to any time period before the asserted patents were issued. The Court granted AstraZeneca s motion to dismiss the Company as a Plaintiff on constitutional standing grounds but denied the motion to dismiss Wyeth as a Plaintiff on constitutional standing grounds. On April 29, 2024, the Court granted AstraZeneca s motion to dismiss AstraZeneca s counterclaims against the Company, which removed the Company from the case. Wyeth remained in the case as a Plaintiff and counterclaim-defendant. Under the Company s worldwide exclusive license agreement with Pfizer, Inc. (the parent of Wyeth) as amended, the Company also maintains contractual rights to recover monetary damages in the AstraZeneca litigation, and those contractual rights are unaffected by the court s March 18, 2024 and April 29, 2024 orders. A jury trial was held May 13-17, 2024. The jury found in favor of Wyeth and against AstraZeneca. In particular, the jury found that use of Tagrisso according to each of the three FDA-approved indications infringes the asserted claims of the 314 and 162 patents, and that AstraZeneca induces that infringement. The jury further rejected AstraZeneca s challenges to the validity of the patents, finding that they are not invalid. The jury awarded damages to Wyeth for past acts of infringement through December 31, 2023, in the amount of 107,500,000. A separate bench trial related to certain equitable claims and defenses raised by AstraZeneca was held before Judge Kennelly on June 20 and 25, 2024. On August 6, 2024, Judge Kennelly issued his ruling on the issues that were tried in the bench trial, finding for Wyeth and against AstraZeneca on all claims and defenses. The Court found that AstraZeneca had not proved its claim that Wyeth s asserted patents were invalid as indefinite, or that Wyeth had committed acts that would give rise to findings of unclean hands, implied waiver, or patent misuse. AstraZeneca has filed a motion challenging the jury s verdict and requesting a new trial. Wyeth has filed a motion requesting supplemental damages for past infringement from January 1, 2024, through the date of judgment; pre-and-post judgment interest, and ongoing royalties through the remaining term of the patents. Briefing on these motions from both sides was completed on July 16, 2024. On August 14, 2024, Judge Kennelly ruled on AstraZeneca s motion challenging the jury s verdict, granting it in part and denying it in part. The Court granted AstraZeneca s motion for judgment as a matter of law that the '314 and '162 patents are invalid under 35 U.S.C. 112 for lacking enablement and adequate written description as to a particular claim limitation. In all other respects, the Court denied AstraZeneca s motion. The Court entered its final and appealable judgment accordingly. The Company respectfully disagrees with the Court s ruling regarding invalidity with respect to the particular claim limitation. Wyeth filed a notice of appeal on September 12, 2024 appealing the District Court s judgment as a matter of law, as well as other rulings and opinions of the Court adverse to Wyeth.

On July 11, 2022, CNIPA decided that claims 5 and 6 of Patent No. ZL200880118789.3 are not eligible for registration in the Chinese Orange Book on the ground that these two pharmaceutical method-of-use claims fall within the scope of patents of crystalline forms, which are not eligible for listing in the Chinese Orange Book.

The Company seeks a judgment that Acebright s product infringes the 789 patent and Acebright s act of offer for sale shall be enjoined. On January 2, 2024, Jiangsu Nanjing Intermediate People s Court accepted the civil complaint. An oral hearing was held on June 19, 2024, during which the Company amended its complaint to allege that Acebright making, selling and offering to sell the generic version of NERLYNX infringes the 789 patent. On July 24, 2024, the Company submitted a request to withdraw the lawsuit. On August 8, 2024, Jiangsu Nanjing Intermediate People s Court accepted the withdrawal request.
