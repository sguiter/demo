Executive Summary For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had total revenue of 3,883,237 compared to 7,700,123 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had total revenue of 17,819,042 compared to 20,954,960 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Volume was similar year to year; however, lower raw material costs was the key factor that contributed to the decrease in total revenue. Gross profit was 1,089,293 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,386,663 for the same three months in 2023. Gross profit was 3,883,348, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,964,870 for the same nine months in 2023. Lower total revenue due to lower raw material costs was the main factor which contributed to the gross profit decrease. Operating expenses were 730,182, and 676,454 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively and 2,320,771 and 2,015,617 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Income from operations was 359,111, and 710,209 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and 1,562,577 and 1,949,253 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Lower gross profit and higher operating expenses contributed to the decrease. Consistent with our growth strategy, we have identified niche markets that can benefit from our expertise in custom powder solutions, such as near-infrared doped phosphors and near infrared applications. These applications enable extended life of phosphors for specific nighttime identification needs of defense personnel and first responders. On June 4, 2024, we announced a five-year manufacturing agreement with Battle Sight Technologies to produce ColdFIRE powder for defense applications. New initiatives are also being pursued that utilize our vacuum hot presses, cold isostatic press, and kilns for increased production and development projects, including diffusion bonding. We continue to invest in developing new products for all

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) our markets including specialty bonding processes for Aerospace customers and innovative applications for Architectural Glass and Thin Film Solar customers. Those products continue to involve research and development expense to enable customer evaluation and accelerate time to market. Several issues continue to affect national and global market conditions. First, inflation continues to impact labor, certain raw material costs and transportation expenses. We seek to pass these increases on to customers but are unable to predict how future or sustained inflationary pressure may impact our results. Second, supply chain disruptions continue to impact customers businesses in certain markets. We are monitoring the impact of the three-day International Longshoreman Association s (ILA) strike on October 1-3, 2024 and further developments to be resolved prior to the ILA extended contract date of January 15, 2025. Thus far, we have not experienced material adverse effects regarding sourcing of raw materials or product shipments; however, timely deliveries and sourcing of certain materials is of increased concern. Third, increased political uncertainties continue to affect global markets. Although we currently have no customers or suppliers in Russia, Ukraine, or the Middle East, we continue to monitor the situations as some raw material comes from Russia for the PVD industry. We are actively maintaining contact with our suppliers and customers, identifying additional suppliers, and adapting to our customers specific circumstances and forecasts. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited) compared to three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (unaudited): Revenue For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had total revenue of 3,883,237 compared to 7,700,123 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Working capital At September 30, 2024, working capital was 8,551,154 compared to 7,633,016 at December 31, 2023, an increase of 918,138, or 12.0 . Cash increased 1,982,052, accounts receivable-trade increased 91,721, inventories decreased 2,864,189, prepaid purchase orders decreased 633,122 and customer deposits decreased 3,135,784. In addition, a short-term investment matured which was reinvested and appeared as long term on the balance sheet at September 30, 2024. Cash from operations Net cash provided by operating activities was 2,410,129, and 2,328,558 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. In addition to the net income generated in each period, this included depreciation and amortization of 366,945 and 347,602, and noncash stock-based compensation costs of 43,980 and 45,485 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The changes in inventories, prepaid purchase orders and customer deposits compared to December 31, 2023, were related to lower raw material costs during the first nine months of 2024. Orders remain solid as customers continue to monitor their inventory very closely with continued emphasis on intra-quarter shipments while also attempting to minimize their inventory at quarter end. Cash from investing activities Cash of 378,928 was used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, for the acquisition of production equipment. Cash of 402,573 was used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Included was 398,360 for the acquisition of production equipment as well as the enclosure of our ceramic machining area. Continued reinvestments in marketable securities has been based on free cash flow and opportunities to earn higher returns. Cash from financing activities Cash of 49,149 and 75,338 was used in financing activities for principal payments to third parties for finance lease obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Debt outstanding Total debt outstanding was 0 at September 30, 2024. The final finance lease payment was made during the third quarter of 2024. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including special purpose entities. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and current

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) expected credit losses, inventory allowances, property and equipment depreciable lives, patents and licenses useful lives, revenue recognition, income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and assessing changes in which impairment of certain long-lived assets may occur. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable. If there is a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected. Inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts. If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory allowances, and our gross margin could be adversely affected. The tax valuation allowance is based on our consideration of new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect our view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. If we were to determine not to be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be necessary which would reduce our net income for that period. Depreciable and useful lives estimated for property and equipment, licenses and patents are based on initial expectations of the period of time these assets and intangibles will benefit us. Changes in circumstances related to a change in our business, change in technology or other factors could result in these assets becoming impaired, which could adversely affect the value of these assets. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and implemented, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management is responsible for the consistency, integrity, and presentation of information. We fulfill our responsibility by maintaining systems of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, and transactions are executed in accordance with established procedures. The concept of reasonable assurance is based upon recognition that 

 19 

Table of Contents 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures (continued) the cost of the controls should not exceed the benefit derived. We believe our systems of internal control provide this reasonable assurance. The Board of Directors exercises its oversight role with respect to our systems of internal control primarily through its Audit Committee, which is comprised of independent directors. The Committee oversees our financial reporting, quarterly reviews, and audits to assess whether their quality, integrity, and objectivity are sufficient to protect shareholders investments. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting for the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected or were reasonably likely to materially affect our disclosure controls and procedures. Additionally, there were no changes in our internal controls that could materially affect our disclosure controls and procedures after the date of their evaluation.

Exhibit 99.1 Contact: Robert Lentz (614) 439-6006 SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. Reports 2024 Third Quarter and Year-to-Date Results COLUMBUS, Ohio (November 1, 2024) SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. SCI (SCIA: OTCQB), today reported financial results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Jeremy Young, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented We achieved stable order volume throughout the first nine months of this year despite signs of slower economic activity. The 2024 third quarter revenue was impacted by a decline in the cost of a key raw material before it began to recover during late September. As the Company adapted to these developments, we also added new customers in our target markets. SCI s financial condition remains strong including 7.6 million of cash and equivalents plus approximately 2 million of investment in marketable securities on September 30, 2024. Revenue Volume was similar for the 2024 year-to-date period compared to 2023. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 17,819,042 versus 20,954,960 in 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, revenue decreased to 3,883,237 compared to 7,700,123 a year ago. Lower cost of a key raw material impacted revenue for both periods in 2024, especially in the third quarter of this year. Gross profit Gross profit declined slightly to 3,883,348 for the 2024 year-to-date period from 3,964,870 for the same period last year. For the 2024 third quarter, gross profit was 1,089,293 compared to 1,386,663 the prior year. The Company s gross profit margin benefited from lower material costs for the nine months and third quarter ended September 30, 2024, versus a year ago. Operating expenses Operating expenses (general and administrative, research development, and marketing and sales) were 2,320,771 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,015,617 last year. The Company s operating expenses for the 2024 third quarter were 730,182 versus 676,454 a year ago. Increased compensation and benefit expenses, which included increased staff, investments in information technology and cybersecurity, plus ongoing costs related to research and development initiatives were key factors that contributed to the 2024 year-to-date and third quarter increases. Net interest income Net interest income increased 50 to 290,908 for the first nine months of 2024 from 194,143 for the same period last year. For the 2024 third quarter, net interest income increased 32 to 107,391 from 81,252 a year ago. Both periods in 2024 benefited from an increase in interest rates due to the Company s higher cash balances and approximately 2.0 million of investments in marketable securities. Income taxes Income tax expense was 421,077 for the 2024 year-to-date period compared to 515,233 the prior year. The Company s effective tax rate was 22.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus 24.0 last year. Income tax expense for the third quarter of 2024 declined to 105,924 from 212,677 a year ago. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 22.7 and 26.9 , respectively, Net income Net income was 1,432,408, or 0.31 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1,628,163, or 0.36 per diluted share, the prior year. For the 2024 third quarter, net income was 360,578, or 0.08 per diluted share, versus 578,784, or 0.13 per 
 1 

 diluted share, in 2023. Higher net interest income and lower income tax expenses were offset by lower gross profit and higher operating expenses for both periods in 2024 compared to last year. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents were 7,656,046 on September 30, 2024, compared to 5,673,994 on December 31, 2023, an increase of 35 . Additionally, there was 2,008,478 of investment in marketable securities on September 30, 2024, versus 1,994,478 at year-end 2023. Debt outstanding The Company had no debt outstanding on September 30, 2024, following a finance lease payment during the 2024 third quarter. There was 49,149 of total debt outstanding on December 31, 2023. About SCI Engineered Materials, Inc.
