CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain information set
forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including in Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations and elsewhere herein may address or relate to future events and expectations and as such constitutes
 forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements which
are not historical reflect our current expectations and projections about our future results, performance, liquidity, financial condition,
prospects and opportunities and are based upon information currently available to us and our management and their interpretation of what
is believed to be significant factors affecting our business, including many assumptions regarding future events. Such forward-looking
statements include statements regarding, among other things: 

the size and growth of the potential markets for our products and the ability to serve those markets; 

our expectations regarding our expenses and revenue, the sufficiency of our cash resources and needs for additional financing; 

the rate and degree of market acceptance of any of our products; 

our expectations regarding competition; 

our anticipated growth strategies; 

our ability to attract or retain key personnel; 

our ability to establish and maintain development partnerships; 

regulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries, especially those related to change in, and enforcement of, cannabis laws; 

our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products; and 

the anticipated trends and challenges in our business and the market in which we operate. 

Forward-looking statements,
which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies, and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words
 may, should, would, could, scheduled, expect, anticipate, 
 estimate, believe, intend, seek, or project or the negative of these
words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. Actual results, performance, liquidity, financial condition and results
of operations, prospects and opportunities could differ materially and perhaps substantially from those expressed in, or implied by, these
forward-looking statements as a result of various risks, uncertainties and other factors. These statements may be found under the section
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (filed on July 10 th , 2024) entitled Risk Factors 
as well as in our other public filings. 

In light of these risks
and uncertainties, and especially given the start-up nature of our business, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements
contained herein will in fact occur. Readers should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as expressly required
by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result
of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason.

Note 1 Organization and Basis of Presentation 

Stemtech Corporation and its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada, USA on September 4, 2009 under the previous name Globe Net
Wireless Corp. On November 19, 2021, the Company adopted an Amendment to its Articles changing the name of the Corporation to Stemtech
Corporation in the state of Nevada, and on April 14, 2022, FINRA gave final approval for said name change, as evidenced by the 8-K filed
that date. Stemtech is a global network marketing company that develops science-based products that it believes supports wellness by helping
the body maintain healthy stem cell physiology, also known as stem cell enhancers. Known as the Stem Cell Nutrition Company , the
Company is a pioneer in stem cell science, and believes it can demonstrate that adult stem cells function as the natural renewal system
of the body. The Company believes its products enhance and support the work of the body s stem cells by releasing more stem cells,
helping to circulate them in the blood and migrate them into tissues, where they can perform their daily function of renewal for optimal
health. Our mission is to enhance wellness and prosperity around the world. These products are marketed internationally by the Company s
subsidiaries and through independent distributors. The Company markets its products under the following brands: RCM System, stemrelease3 ,
Stemflo MigraStem and OraStem (Oral Health Care), and Cellect One Rapid Renew Stem Cell Peptide Night Cream. 

On August 19, 2021, Stemtech Corporation Stemtech ),
a Delaware corporation, entered into a Merger Agreement (the Merger Agreement with Globe Net Wireless Corp. Globe
Net or GNTW ). The merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization in accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805, Business Combinations . Management evaluated the guidance contained in ASC 805 with respect to the identification of the acquirer
in the merger and concluded, based on a consideration of the pertinent facts and circumstances, that Stemtech acquired Globe Net for financial
accounting purposes. On November 9, 2021, the Company changed its fiscal year end from a fiscal year end of August 31 to a calendar year-end
of December 31.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported expenses during the year. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including
those related to accrued expenses. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.

Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

Going Concern 

As reflected in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, the Company had a net loss of 3,378,331 and 5,431,979 respectively, for the period ended September 30, 2024 and
year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 30,436,682 at September 30, 2024. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months from the issuance date
of this report. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to implement its
business plan, raise capital, and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support
its daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering. While the Company believes
in the viability of its strategy to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional
funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Basis of Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements of the Company
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and considering the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include investments
in highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains accounts at financial institutions
that, from time to time, may exceed the federal depository insurance coverage limit. On September 30, 2024, the uninsured cash balance
amounted to approximately 0.00. 

Inventory 

The Company values inventory, consisting of finished
goods and raw materials, at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using an average cost method. The Company reduces
inventory for the diminution of value, resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability, equal to the
difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value. The Company evaluates its current level of inventory considering
historical sales and other factors and, based on this evaluation, classifies inventory markdowns in the statement of operations as a component
of cost of goods sold. These markdowns are estimates, which could vary significantly from actual requirements if future economic conditions,
customer demand or competition differ from expectations. Currently, there are no Markdowns identified. The Company continuously evaluates
the levels of inventory held and any inventory held above the expected level of sales in the next twelve months, is classified as non-current
inventory. 

Intangible Assets and Goodwill 

The estimated fair values of acquired intangibles
are generally determined based upon future economic benefits such as earnings and cash flows. Acquired identifiable intangible assets
are recorded at fair value and are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Acquired intangible assets with an indefinite life are
not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amounts of those assets are below their estimated fair values. Impairment is tested under ASC 350, Intangibles -
Goodwill and Other . 

9 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but
is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The
fair value of the reporting unit is evaluated on qualitative factors to determine if the reported value may be impaired. If the qualitative
factors indicate a likelihood of impairment, we then evaluate carrying value of the reporting unit based on quantitative factors using
the income approach. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit over its
implied fair value. 

Notes Payable
and Convertible Debentures 

U.S. GAAP requires
companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as freestanding derivative financial instruments
according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded
derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid
instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise
applicable U.S. GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms
as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument
is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity . See Note 6 
 Notes Payable and Convertible Debentures 

Factoring Liability 

We have entered
into factoring agreements with various financial institutions to receive cash for our future revenues. These transactions are treated
as a debt instrument and are accounted for as a liability because the Company makes weekly payments towards the balance and fees. We utilize
factoring arrangements as an integral part of our financing for working capital. Any change in the availability of these factoring arrangements
could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. See Note 6 Notes Payable and Convertible Debentures . 

Derivative Liabilities 

The Company classifies as equity any contracts
that: (i) require physical settlement or net-share settlement; or (ii) provide the Company with a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement
in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement) providing that such contracts are indexed to the Company s own stock.
The Company classifies as assets or liabilities any contracts that: (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash
settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the Company s control); or (ii) gives the counterparty a choice
of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company assesses the classification
of its common stock purchase warrants and other freestanding derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification
between assets and liabilities is required. 

On May 1, 2023, the Company no longer had derivative
liabilities associated with the warrants and their cumulative value of 1,011,451 was reclassified into additional paid-in capital on
the consolidated statement of stockholders deficit. 

The Company s freestanding derivatives consisted
of warrants to purchase common stock that were issued in connection with the issuance of debt and the sale of common shares, and of embedded
conversion options within convertible notes. The Company evaluated these derivatives to assess their proper classification in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 using the applicable classification criteria enumerated under
ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . See Note 7 Derivative Liabilities 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

The Company assesses, on an annual basis, the
recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets and long-lived assets used in continuing operations. A loss is recognized when
expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest) are less than the carrying amount of the asset. The impairment loss is
determined as the difference by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The Company evaluated its long-lived assets
for any indications of impairment. The Company concluded that there was no impairment, however there can be no assurance that market conditions
will not change or demand for the Company s products will continue which could result in impairment of long-lived assets in the
future. 

10 

Revenue Recognition 

It is the Company s policy that revenues
from product sales is recognized in accordance with ASC 606 Revenues from Contracts with Customers . Five basic steps must be followed
before revenue can be recognized; (1) Identifying the contract(s) with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations; (2)
Identifying the performance obligations in the contract, such as promising to transfer goods or services to a customer; (3) Determining
the transaction price, meaning the amount of consideration in a contract to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring
promised goods or services to a customer; (4) Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, which requires
the Company to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices of
each distinct good or services promised in the contract; and (5) Recognizing revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation
by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance
obligation. 

Revenues from direct retail sales to consumers
and revenues from independent distributors occur when title and risk of loss has passed, which generally occurs at the time the products
are shipped. Revenues are recorded net of estimated sales returns and allowances. 

Comprehensive Loss 

The other comprehensive loss in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements relates to the net loss of the Company for the respective period as well as unrealized foreign currency
translation adjustments. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

A portion of the Company s business operations
occur outside the United States. The local currency of each of the Company s subsidiaries is generally its functional currency.
All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates existing at the consolidated balance sheet dates, revenue
and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates and stockholders deficit is recorded at historical exchange rates.
The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders deficit in the consolidated
balance sheets and as a component of comprehensive loss. Transaction gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net in the
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

Leases 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842, Leases, ASC 842 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of right-of-use ROU assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases previously classified as operating leases. The Company adopted ASC 842 effective
January 1, 2022 and recognized and measured operating leases existing at, or entered into after, January 1, 2021 (the beginning of the
earliest comparative period presented) using a modified retrospective approach, with certain practical expedients available (see Note
5). The Company s accounting for finance leases under ASC 842 remained substantially unchanged. 

In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines
if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. Operating
lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease assets represent the Company s right
to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease payments, initial
direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment of operating lease assets. To determine the present value of future lease payments, the
Company estimates the incremental borrowing rates corresponding to the reasonably certain lease term. If the estimate of the Company s
incremental borrowing rate was changed, the operating lease assets and liabilities could differ materially. 

11 

Finance lease assets and liabilities are recognized
at the lease commencement date at the present value of the future lease payments not yet paid using the Company s incremental borrowing
rate, Assets acquired under finance lease are included in property and equipment, while finance lease obligations are included in other
current liabilities and other long- term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Income Tax 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with ASC 74, Income Taxes . Accordingly, deferred income taxes are determined utilizing the asset and liability method based on
the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial accounting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities under the
applicable tax law. Deferred tax balances are computed using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences reverse.
Valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets are provided for, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts more
likely than not to be realized. 

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions
in accordance with ASC Topic 740-10, which prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure
of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements. According to ASC Topic 740-10, tax positions must
meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. The Company s accounting policy is to classify interest and penalties relating
to uncertain tax positions under income taxes, however the Company did not recognize such items in its fiscal 2023 and 2022 consolidated
financial statements and did not recognize any liability with respect to unrecognized tax positions in its consolidated balance sheet. 

Business Combinations 

The Company allocates the fair value of purchase
consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. The excess
of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant
estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customer lists,
acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management s estimates
of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result,
actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, the Company may
record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the
measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. 

Fair Value of the Acquired Assets 

The Company accounted for the acquisitions discussed
in Note 4 as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting as prescribed in ASC 805 and ASC 820. In accordance with
ASC 805 and ASC 820, the Company assigned fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, identifiable intangible assets and
liabilities assumed as of the acquisition dates. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of purchase consideration
over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 

Segment Information 

The Company manages its operations in three geographic
segments for the purpose of assessing performance and making operating decisions including North America (including its subsidiaries in
United States and Canada), Latin America (including subsidiaries in Mexico and Ecuador) and Asia (including its subsidiaries in Malaysia
and Taiwan).

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In July 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update ASU 2023-03, Presentation of Financial Statement (Topic 205), Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive
Income (Topic 220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505), and Compensation - Stock
Compensation (Topic 718), to amend various SEC paragraphs in the ASC to reflect the issuance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
120, among other things. The ASU does not provide any new guidance so there is no transition or effective date associated with it. The
Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU 2023-03 on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In November 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment
Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for
reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company s
annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
 Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically
relating to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company s annual periods beginning January
1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. 

The Company is currently evaluating the potential
effects that ASU 2023-07 and ASU 2023-09 will have on the consolidated financial statement disclosures. 

Net Loss per Common Share, basic and diluted 

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing
net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss
per share includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants, using various methods such as the treasury
stock or modified treasury stock method in the determination of dilutive shares outstanding during each reporting period. 

For the period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the
dilutive effect of 14,448,206 and 14,448,206, respectively, of common stock warrants have not been included in the average shares outstanding
for the calculation of net loss per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive as a result of the Company s net losses in these
periods. 

Fair Value Measurements 

As defined in ASC 820 Fair Value
Measurements, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based
on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement). 

The Company determines the level in
the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement falls in its entirety, based on the lowest level input that is significant
to the fair value measurement in its entirety. In determining the appropriate levels, the Company performs an analysis of the assets and
liabilities at each reporting period end. 

13 

The Company s financial instruments
consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued interest, notes payable and, convertible debentures. The carrying amounts
of these financial instruments are of approximate fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing
rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements. The Company s derivative liabilities are valued using option pricing
models with Level 3 inputs. 

Sequencing 

Based upon ASC 815-15-25 Embedded Derivatives ,
the Company has adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 Contracts in Entity's Own Equity to its outstanding
convertible notes and warrants. Pursuant to the sequencing approach, the Company evaluates its contracts based upon the earliest issuance
date.

Assets and Goodwill 

Original Acquisition 

On May 7, 2018, the Company purchased the assets
of Stemtech International, Inc. (the Former Parent Company ), out of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy for 400,000 and the assumption
of a 4,000,000 note acquiring 100 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Canada, Mexico, Stemtech Mexico, Stemtech New Zealand,
Taiwan, Korea and Ecuador; and Stemtech Malaysia Holdings that owns two-thirds of its subsidiary Stemtech Malaysia. In addition to the
net tangible assets, the Company acquired various intangible assets including patent products, licenses and trademarks and customers and
distribution lists. The estimated useful lives of the identifiable intangible assets range from six to fourteen years. 

The excess purchase price has been recorded as
goodwill in the amount of 467,409 at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The estimated useful life of the identifiable intangible assets
is six to fourteen years. 

LFR Acquisition 

In March 2023, the Company acquired 100 of LFR,
a research and development company with expertise in the formulation of products. 

The consideration paid was 2.4 million shares
of the Company with a fair value of 271,920. At the time of purchase, LFR s liabilities exceeded its assets by 15,205, and the
difference between the net tangible assets and the purchase price, being 287,125, was allocated to a non-compete agreement and will be
amortized over 18 months.

 and exchange agreement concerning a Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note with Leonite. Under this agreement, Leonite agreed
 to settle its outstanding liability and cancel its warrants in exchange for 10,648,152 common stock shares of the Company to purchase
 common stock at 0.05 per share. As the debt was settled, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment worth 132,142 and owed
 637,684 worth of common shares. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company issued 6,340,591 common shares, leaving a payable balance

 an institutional investor Holder for up to 7,000,000 through a convertible promissory note, share purchase agreement,
 and warrant agreement (the 2023 Note ). The 2023 Note, with a principal amount reaching up to 7,000,000, carried an original
 issue discount of 12 and was structured to be disbursed in four installments. These installments included a first disbursement of
 1,000,000 on March 27, 2023, a second disbursement of 200,000 within three days after filing an S-1 registration statement, a third
 disbursement of 500,000 forty-five days after the effectiveness of the S-1 registration statement, and a fourth disbursement of

 an interest rate of seven percent (7 per annum and could be redeemed by the Company at any time for an amount equivalent to one
 hundred twenty-five percent (125 of the outstanding principal and interest on the Note. Additional disbursements were discretionary
 on the Holder's part and could be executed at any time. Should the Holder's broker decline custody of the issued securities, the
 Holder would have no obligation to adhere to the disbursement schedule, yet the option to make such disbursement would remain. 

On April 11, 2023, the Company amended its Promissory Note
 with MCUS, resulting in the conversion price being fixed at 0.05. Since the Promissory Note is not significantly different after
 the amendment, the note was treated using modification accounting. After eliminating the bifurcated derivative liability, the Company
 recorded a gain of 171,362 on settlement of derivative liabilities. On May 1, 2023, the Company partially settled its debt with
 MCUS by agreeing to issue 7,739,938 shares of common stock, of which 5,121,200 were issued, resulting in a loss on extinguishment

Similarly, on May 1, 2023, the Company amended its convertible promissory
 note with SHRG, wherein SHRG capitalized 222,556 of accrued interest and waived its conversion rights as per the original agreement.
 However, this amendment was contingent upon the Company making a payment of 222,556 to SHRG, which was duly fulfilled in May 2023.
 This amendment was treated using extinguishment accounting which eliminated the bifurcated derivative liability and added additional
 debt discount resulted in a recorded gain of 557,793 on extinguishment (see Note 9 for other gain (loss) amounts on extinguishment
 in 2023). 

18 

As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding gross principal balance for

The aggregate balance of convertible notes payable, net of discount,
 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 1,959,364 and 1,596,960, respectively. 

Note 7 Derivative Liabilities 

The Company issued debt instruments that consist
of the issuance of convertible notes with variable conversion provisions. The conversion terms of the convertible notes are variable based
on certain factors, such as the future price of the Company s common stock, which gives rise to a derivative liability which is
a non-cash liability. The number of shares of common stock to be issued is based on the future price of the Company s common stock.
The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the promissory note is indeterminate. Pursuant to ASC Subtopic 815-15
 Embedded Derivatives ASC 815-15 ), the fair values of the variable conversion options and warrants and shares to
be issued were recorded as derivative liabilities on the issuance date and revalued at each reporting period. Based upon ASC 840-15-25,
the Company has adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to its outstanding convertible notes and warrants.
Pursuant to the sequencing approach, the Company evaluates its contracts based upon the earliest issuance date.

Company Overview 

Stemtech Corporation was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on March 4, 2009. Our registration statement on Form S-1 was filed with the SEC was declared effective
on May 15, 2013. On August 19, 2021, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Stemtech Corporation by which the Company acquired
one hundred percent of the shares of STEMTECH CORPORATION in exchange for the issuance of 37,060,000 shares of the Company, approximately
85 of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company. On November 19, 2021, the Company adopted an Amendment to its Articles changing
the name of the Corporation to Stemtech Corporation in the state of Nevada, and on April 14, 2022, FINRA gave final approval for said
name change. Stemtech has pioneered and patented a whole new category of dietary supplements. Stemtech s advanced Stem Cell Nutrition
formulations are one-of-a-kind natural products designed to help support the three most important aspects of stem cell physiology: 1)
Releasing more stem cells; 2) their circulation in the blood; and 3) Migration into tissues, where they can perform their daily function
of renewal and rejuvenation for optimal health. We actually harness the incredible power of adult stem cells. How does this work? Adult
stem cells are released from your bone marrow into the bloodstream, they then Circulate in the bloodstream and flow to the tissues most
in need. As they arrive, the adult stem cells migrate into the tissues, reproduce and become new, healthy cells of those tissues. This
process takes place every single day, even without tissue damage, as part of the natural renewal system of the body. It is important to
understand that Stemtech s products do not contain stem cells. They are composed of natural botanicals and other ingredients that
have been clinically documented to support the performance of your own adult stem cells. Stemtech also offers our all-natural OraStem
toothpaste, which is a tooth whitener, breath freshener, antimicrobial, stem cell attracting and promotes good gum health. In December
2022, our new Cellect One Rapid Renew Stem Cell Peptide Night Cream. Cellect One is a Stemtech proprietary formula containing
an FDA patented ingredient, Red Oak Bark, which enables deep penetration to promote good skin health. While sales of products obviously
create the cash flow, our real business model is not just sales , but lateral penetration. We do this through our IBPs -
 Independent Business Partner Sales Forces, and we invest much energy in growing our IBPs. Post funding, Stemtech is projecting
the addition of 30,000 new independent business partner reps over the next 12 to 24 months, adding to the existing IBPs. With an enhanced
compensation plan, IBPs will be even more incentivized to build their network, attracting additional industry leaders. IBPs are a testimonial
to our product and business model, lowering our customer acquisition costs. Our IBPs offer highly flexible yet steady income
which is most adapted to todays Laptop Cellphone Lifestyle , with structured and organized weekly Corporate training
calls, a personalized website, back-office tracking, oversight and management Tools, Reports, Training Materials and Social Sharing. With this new cash infusion, the Company has engaged experienced marketing and social media professionals
to initiate new marketing strategies which are expected to bring increased activity. Management conservatively believes that given the
cash on hand and working expenditures as describe above, we can reinvigorate sales to be more consistent with the company s previous
revenue historically, as we were recognized 4 times in the Inc 5000 Magazine s list of fastest growing companies. Below this IBP
level, we plan to have our DTC (Direct To Consumer) network marketing Distribution model. This integrative model allows
us an immediate global presence and ability to operate in multiple countries on any continent. We are uniquely positioned in this post
pandemic economy beset by supply chain issues, as this method requires no up-front or required buy-in of inventory, with monthly shipments
available for known recurring sales. This platform has us now operating at the intersection of the ecommerce economy, social economy and
gig economy. 

24 

The Company has registered our Orastem 
trademark registration in Mexico as noted in our press release of August 23, 2022. In addition, Stemtech filed our new stemceuticals 
trademark registration. Stemtech has worked to reduce overhead costs by outsourcing U.S. order fulfillment services to a third-party partner
who is also be responsible for inventory planning and production scheduling, since August 7, 2023. Further, on August 1, 2023, the customer
service function for the U.S. was transitioned to our Mexico offices in Guadalajara at a cost savings and improved synergistic benefits.
With the new inventory process, the cost of insurance coverage was reduced to lower rates. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our consolidated financial statements have been
prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability
and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect
we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among
other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. 

Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024
Compared to the Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2023. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net sales
were 1,031,630 and 1,298,322, respectively. This variance is due to a decrease in available inventory for sale and management anticipates
net sales will decrease as it has recently implemented a price increase, however current economic risks of recession can influence this. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of
goods sold was 380,205 versus 290,896, for a positive variance of 89,309 or 31 . This variance is inversely compared to the decrease
in sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of an increase in manufacturing costs and raw materials. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our commissions
expenses were 113,192 and 386,070, respectively, resulting in an decrease of 272,878, or 71 . 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our general
and administrative expenses were 1,179,633 and 1,081,224, respectively, resulting in a increase of 98,232 or 9 . The increase is
primarily due to an increase in professional fees. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our and
marketing expenses were 75,070 and 119,123, respectively, resulting in a decrease of 44,053, or 37 .

expenses were 454,935 compared to total non-operating income of 427,573 during the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting
in an increase in expense of 27,362. The difference is primarily due to an increase of 67,496 in interest expense offset by an increase
of 40,134 in interest income in 2024. 

The net loss attributable to Stemtech for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 1,171,405 compared to net income attributable to Stemtech for the three month period ended September 30, 2023 was 1,041,800.

were 3,740,000 and 3,559,789, respectively, resulting in an increase of 180,211, or 5 . This variance is due to general price increases
in 2024, however current economic risks of recession can influence this. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of goods

subject to commissions. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our selling
and marketing expenses were 265,530 and 387,102, respectively, resulting in a decrease of 121,572, or 37 . 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our general
and administrative expenses were 4,143,951 and 4,366,912, respectively, resulting in a decrease of 222,961, or 9 . The decrease is
primarily due to stock issued for services in 2023 and the cutting of operational expenses, such as personnel. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our total
operating expenses were 5,101,839 and 5,575,492, respectively, resulting in a decrease of 218,522, or 14 . The decrease in operating
expenses was caused by the factors described above.

30, 2024 and 2023, was 3,376,121 and 3,565,449, respectively. The decrease in net loss was caused by the factors described above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We are not currently profitable, and we cannot provide any assurance
of when we will be profitable. We incurred a net loss of 3,372,986 and 3,565,449 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we met our short-term liquidity requirements from issuance of debt. 

As of September 30, 2024, our current assets were 762,666 compared
to 400,710 in current a689ets at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our current liabilities were 9,589,603 compared to 6,462,036

operating lease liabilities, 192,685 of deferred revenues. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

We have not generated positive cash flows from
operating activities. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities were 414,508 versus
 904,009 a year earlier, which is primarily due to the change in working capital accounts. Amortization of debt discount of 362,404,
as well as 56,219 in lease liabilities, 334,466 depreciation and amortization expense, 54,900 amortization of right to use asset, and
 915,981 of stock compensation expense and 11,781 in stock issued for services. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

We have financed our operations primarily from
the issuance of notes payable. For the six-month period ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided from financing activities of 826,893
mainly consisted of proceeds from factoring agreements of 240,972 partially offset by payments on notes payable of 140,746. For the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, 1,308,616 cash provided from financing activities mainly consisted of proceeds from notes
payable of 1,711,000 partially offset by payments on factoring agreements of 403,293. 

26 

Plan of Operation and Funding 

We expect that working capital requirements will
continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working Existing working capital,
further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three
months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds
of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases
in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with
a start-up business; (iii) marketing expenses; and (iv) IT website development. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances
of securities and loans. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating
requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further,
such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon
acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take
advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

Stemtech has experienced continued growth and
with more awareness of the benefits of stem cells for improving health naturally. Demand is expected to continue to rise. During the past
year, we experienced several out-of-stock situations. With additional capital, the Company will be able to sustain uninterrupted growth,
increasing sales revenue and profitability. The overall stem cell global market, including stem cell therapy and pharma are projected
to be 30 billion by 2030 per Research and Marketing , an independent publication. As the pioneer in stem cell nutrition,
Stemtech is well positioned for growth as awareness increases. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP for interim
financial statement presentation and in accordance with Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
required in annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting
only of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations and cash flows. The results
of operations presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of the date of this report, we do not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material
to investors. 

Stockholders Deficit 

Authorized Shares 

Effective May 5, 2023, the Company is authorized
to issue up to 400,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.001 par value. Prior to May 5, 2023, the Company was authorized to issue up to 200,000,000
shares (see Note 9). Each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a stockholder
vote. All shares of common stock are non-assessable and non-cumulative, with no pre-emptive rights. 

Commitments and Contingencies 

None. 

27 

Financing 

On March 27, 2023, the Company and an institutional
investor (the Holder executed an investment agreement for up to 7,000,000 through a convertible promissory note, share
purchase agreement and warrant agreement (the 2023 Note ). The 2023 Note has a principal amount of up to 7,000,000 with an
original issue discount of 12 and is to be disbursed in four (4) disbursements as set forth as follows: (i) the first disbursement in
the amount of 1,000,000 occurred on March 27, 2023; (ii) the second disbursement in the amount of 200,000 is due within three (3) days
after the filing of an S-1 registration statement; (iii) the third disbursement in the amount of 500,000 is due forty-five (45) days
after effectiveness of an S-1 registration statement; and (iv) 120,000 is due forty-five (45) days after the third disbursement. The
2023 Note carries an interest rate equal to seven percent (7 per annum and is redeemable by the Company at any time at an amount equal
to one hundred twenty-five percent (125 of the then outstanding principal and interest accrued on the Note. All additional disbursements
will be made at the Holder s discretion, at any time, and if the Holder s broker refuses to custody the securities issued
in connection therewith, the Holder will have no obligation to make a disbursement under the disbursement schedule but will have the option
to make such disbursement. Future financing through equity investments is likely to be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, the terms
of securities we may issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable for our new investors. Newly issued securities may include
preferences, superior voting rights, and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have additional dilutive effects.
Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting
fees, and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such
as convertible notes and warrants, which will adversely impact our financial condition. Our ability to obtain needed financing may be
impaired by such factors as the capital markets, both generally and specifically in the nutraceutical industry, which could impact the
availability or cost of future financing. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our revenue
from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, even to the extent that we reduce our operations accordingly, we may
be required to cease operations. We have no plans, arrangements or contingencies in place in the event that we cease operations. 

On May 11, 2023, the Company filed a registration
statement on Form S-1 File No. 333-271846) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission together with
all exhibits thereto (the Registration Statement ). No securities were sold in connection with this offering. 

On September 2024, pursuant to Rule 477 under the Securities Act of
1933 (the Act ), the Company respectfully requested a withdrawal of its Registration Statement with Commission.
