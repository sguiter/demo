 The Company is highly dependent on the continued availability of its processing facilities at Solvita and APC in Dayton, Ohio and could be harmed if the physical infrastructure of these facilities is unavailable for any prolonged period of time. 
 Certain Economic Development Grants 
 The Company obtained certain economic development grants from state and local authorities totaling up to including of cash grants to offset costs to acquire and develop the APC Facility. The economic development grants are subject to certain job creation milestones through December 31, 2023, and have clawback clauses if the Company does not 
 18 

from the cash grants. 
 Fair Value of the Debt Derivative Liabilities 
 The fair value of the debt derivative liabilities is as of September 30, 2024. The fair value of the debt derivative liabilities is determined using a probability-weighted expected return model based upon potential settlement scenarios, of which ended December 31, 2023, with the Credit Facility. The estimated settlement value of each scenario, which includes any required make-whole payment, is discounted to present value using a discount rate that is derived based upon the initial terms of the Credit Facility at issuance and corroborated utilizing a synthetic rating analysis. The calculated fair values under the scenarios are then compared to the fair value of a plain vanilla note, with the difference reflecting the fair value of the debt derivative liabilities. The Company estimated the make-whole payments required under each scenario according to the terms of the Credit Facility to generate an internal rate of return equal to thr ough the scheduled maturity dates, less the total of all quarterly interest and royalty payments previously paid to the Lender . The calculation utilized the XIRR function in Microsoft Excel as required by the Credit Facility. If the debt is not prepaid but instead is held to its scheduled maturities, the Company s estimate of the make-whole payment for the first tranche and second tranche of the Credit Facility due on June 30, 2027, and June 30, 2028, respectively, are approximately . The Company has consistently applied this approach since the inception of the debt agreement on June 30, 2020. 
 The Company is aware that the Lender may have an alternative interpretation of the calculation of the make-whole payments that the Company believ es does not properly utilize the same methodology utilized by the XIRR function in Microsoft Excel as described in the Credit Facility. The Company estimates the top end of the ra nge of the make-whole payments if the debt is held to scheduled maturity under an alternative interpretation to be approximately for the first tranche of the Credit Facility due on June 30, 2027, and approximately for the second tranche of the Credit Facility due on June 30, 2028. Further, if the debt is prepaid prior to the scheduled maturity dates and subject to the alternative interpretation, the make-whole payment would be larger than the amounts herein. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is and may be subject to various claims, lawsuits, and proceedings in the ordinary course of the Company's business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. While there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding or other loss contingency involving the Company, in the opinion of management, such claims are either adequately covered by insurance or otherwise indemnified, or are not expected individually or in the aggregate, to result in a material, adverse effect on the Comp any's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, it is possible that the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by these contingencies.

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report and our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. All dollar amounts in the discussion and analysis, unless noted otherwise, are presented in thousands. 
 Financial information for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect the retrospective application of voluntary changes in the Company s accounting policy for shipping and handling costs, as discussed under Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to Axogen, the Company, we, us and our refer to Axogen, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries Axogen Corporation AC ), Axogen Processing Corporation, Axogen Europe GmbH and Axogen Germany GmbH. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are the leading company focused specifically on the science, development, and commercialization of technologies for peripheral nerve regeneration and repair. We are passionate about providing the opportunity to restore nerve function and quality of life for patients with peripheral nerve injuries. We provide innovative, clinically proven, and economically effective repair solutions for surgeons and healthcare providers. Peripheral nerves provide the pathways for both motor and sensory signals throughout the body. Every day, people suffer traumatic injuries or undergo surgical procedures that impact the function of their peripheral nerves. Physical damage to a peripheral nerve or the inability to properly reconnect peripheral nerves can result in the loss of muscle or organ function, the loss of sensory feeling, or the initiation of pain. 
 Product Portfolio 
 Avance Nerve Graft, a biologically active off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft for bridging severed peripheral nerves without the comorbidities associated with a second surgical site. 
 Axoguard Nerve Connector , a porcine (pig) submucosa extracellular matrix ("ECM") coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed peripheral nerves. 
 Axoguard Nerve Protector , a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect damaged peripheral nerves and reinforce the nerve reconstruction while preventing soft tissue attachments. 
 Axoguard HA+ Nerve Protector , is comprised of a processed porcine submucosa ECM base layer with a hyaluronate-alginate gel coating designed to provide short- and long-term protection for peripheral nerve injuries. The gel layer facilitates enhanced nerve gliding to aid in minimizing soft tissue attachments, while the base layer is remodeled into a long-term protective tissue layer. 
 Axoguard Nerve Cap , a porcine submucosa ECM product used to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma. 
 Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix , a multi-layer amniotic membrane allograft used to protect and separate tissues in the surgical bed during the critical phase of tissue healing. 
 Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator, used to measure the innervation density of any surface area of the skin. 
 Our portfolio of products is currently available in the United States ("U.S."), Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain and several other European, Asian and Latin American countries. 
 Revenue from the distribution of our nerve repair products, Avance Nerve Graft, Axoguard Nerve Connector , Axoguard Nerve Protector , Axoguard HA+ Nerve Protector , Axoguard Nerve Cap and Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix , in the United States ("U.S.") is the main contributor to our total reported sales and have been the key component of our growth to date. 
 On June 24, 2024, we announced the full launch of Avive+ Soft Tissue Matrix. Avive+ is processed and distributed in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") requirements for Human Cellular and Tissue-based Products (HCT/P) under 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations and U.S. State regulations as a 361 human tissue product. Products regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act are a product category under close scrutiny by the FDA for 
 20 

compliance with the regulatory requirements and potentially subject to regulatory change in the future. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to potential compliance actions by the FDA or state regulators and could risk the commercial availability of the product. 
 Our strategy remains focused on deepening our presence in high-potential accounts specifically, Level 1 trauma centers and academic-affiliated hospitals with a high number of trained micro-surgeons. We will drive growth in these accounts through targeted expansion of nerve repair indications, and driving deeper adoption of our Nerve Repair Algorithm across multiple surgical specialties. 
 Summary of Operational and Business Highlights 
 We completed the BLA submission for Avance Nerve Graft on September 6, 2024. On November 1, 2024 the FDA informed us that they had accepted the BLA for filing and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act PDUFA goal date of September 5, 2024. The FDA further indicated that it does not currently plan to hold an advisory committee meeting for the application. 
 Revenues were 48,644 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7,373 or 17.9 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross profit was 36,438 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4,734 or 14.9 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

 Revenues 
 Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 7,373 or 17.9 to 48,644 as compared to 41,271 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was driven by an increase in unit volume of 7.7 , product mix of 6.0 and a 4.2 increase in prices. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 4,734 or 14.9 to 36,438 as compared to 31,704 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was 74.9 and 76.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease in gross margin is due to the change in our product mix. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Total costs and expenses increased by 1,025 or 2.9 to 36,754 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 35,729 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase in total costs and expenses was primarily due to compensation costs of 3,552 partially offset by a reduction in royalty fees o f 930, R D projects of 874, and marketing programs of 770. 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 241 or 1.3 to 18,924 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 19,165 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to royalty fees of 930, marketing programs of 770 and travel cost of 80, partially offset by increase in compensation costs of 1,495. 
 22 

Research and development expenses increased 302 or 4.5 to 6,996 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6,694 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase w as primarily due to product development, clinical expenses, as well as non-clinical expenses related to the BLA for Avance Nerve Graft. Product development expenses represented approximately 52 and 62 of total research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Clinical trial expenses represented approximately 48 and 38 of total research and development expense the three months ended September 30, 2024 , and 2023, respectively. 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 964 or 9.8 to 10,834 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 9,870 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The in crease was primarily due to compensation costs of 1,281 of which 695 was stock compensation related to the departure of the former CEO, bad debt expense of 350, and certain other cost of 133, partially offset by a decrease in professional services of 800. 
 Other Income and Expense 
 Other expense, net increased by 1,478 to 1,542 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other expense, net of 64 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase in other expense was due to an increase in interest expense of 1,066, and the change in the fair value of derivatives of 389. 
 Interest expense increased by 1,066 to 1,893 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 827 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the completion of the APC facility in 2023 resulting in no additional interest expense being capitalized for that facility during 2024. We recognized total interest expense of 1,877 and 1,866 in connection with the Credit Facility for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, of which 0 and 1,043 of this interest was capitalized to the construction costs of the APC Facility during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Income Taxes 
 We had no income tax expense or benefit during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, due to the incurrence of net operating losses in each of these periods, the benefits of which have a full valuation allowance. From time to time, we receive notices of examination of prior tax filings from federal and state authorities. We do not believe that there are currently any material outstanding tax expenses or benefits.

Clinical trial expenses represented approximately 46 and 40 of total research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 275 or 1 to 30,206 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to 30,481 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in net compensation costs of 1,935 of which 695 was stock compensation related to the departure of the former CEO, partially offset by an increase in bad debt of 915, professional service costs of 542, and other costs of 203. 
 Other Income and Expense 
 Other (expense), net was 5,110 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to other income, net of 445 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease was driven by an increase in interest expense of 5,413, a de crease in investment income of 335, and the change in fair value of derivatives of 107, partially offset by the decrease in other expense of 210 and rental income of 90 . 
 Investment income decreased by 335 or 29 to 816 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to investment income of 1,151 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This change was primarily due to the decrease in investments. 
 Interest expense increased by 5,413 to 6,405 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 992 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We recognized total interest expense of 6,342 and 5,442 in connection with the Credit Facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, of which 0 and 5,240 of this interest was capitalized to the construction costs of the APC Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
 Income Taxes 
 We had no income tax expense or benefit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and 2023, due to the incurrence of net operating losses in each of these periods, the benefits of which have a full valuation allowance. From time to time, we receive notices of examination of prior tax filings from federal and state authorities. We do not believe that there are any additional tax expenses or benefits currently available. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 In preparing financial statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. Management regularly reviews our accounting policies and financial information disclosures. A summary of significant accounting estimates that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements was provided in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the quarter covered by this report, there have been no material changes to the accounting estimate s and assumptions previously disclosed. 
 Reclassification of Financial Information 
 Effective as of the first quarter of 2024, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for shipping and handling costs. Although the prior method of accounting continues to be an accepted alternative, the new accounting policy is more widely used in the industry and provides improved comparability of the Company s financial statements to its peers. Accordingly, the financial information for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect retrospective application of the new policy. Effective as of the first quarter of 2024, we ceased allocating certain costs to and from certain departments. Previously such costs had been allocated based on our estimate of the proportionate share of total expense to each line item. We determined that these changes would better reflect industry practice and would provide more meaningful information as well as increased transparency of our operations. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional discussion. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents and investments totaling 24,530. Our cash equivalents are comprised primarily of a money market mutual fund and our investments consist of U.S. 
 25 

Treasuries. Our cash and cash equivalents and investments decreased by 6,494 to 24,530 from 31,024 at December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of operating activities. 
 We had working capital of 63,219 and a current ratio of 3.7x at September 30, 2024, compared to working capital of 57,574 and a current ratio of 2.9x at December 31, 2023. The increase in our working capital at September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Based on current estimates, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments, as well as cash provided by sales of our products will allow us to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months from the date of the accompanying financial statements. 
 Cash Flow Information 
 The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (4,200) (5,505) Investing activities (9,484) 19,530 Financing activities 1,320 1,536 Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (12,364) 15,561 
 Net Cash Used in O perating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 4,200 and 5,505 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The unfavorable change in net cash used in operating activities of 1,305, or 24 , is due to the net unfavorable change of 9,656 in working capital accounts partially offset by the decrease in the net loss of 7,409 and noncash changes of 3,552. 
 Net Cash Used in) Provided by Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 9,484 as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 19,530 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a net increase of 29,014, or 149 of net cash used in investing activities. The increase of net cash used in investing activities is principally due to the decrease in the net proceeds from the sale and purchase of investments totaling 38,444, and the increase in purchases of intangible assets of 548, partially offset by the reduction in purchases of property and equipment of 9,978 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 1,320 and 1,536 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 216. The unfavorable change in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 217 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Credit Facilities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 50,000 outstanding in indebtedness under a credit facility 35,000 maturing on June 30, 2027, and 15,000 maturing on June 30, 2028. Quarterly interest only and revenue participation payments are due through each of the maturity dates. Interest is calculated as 7.5 plus the greater of three-month SOFR plus 0.1 ("Adjusted SOFR") or 2.0 (12.92 as of September 30, 2024 ). Revenue participation payments are calculated as a percentage of our net revenues, up to 70,000 in any given year, adding approximately 1.5 per year of additional interest payments on the outstanding indebtedness. Upon each maturity date or upon such date earlier repayment occurs, we will repay the principal balance and provide a make-whole payment calculated to generate an internal rate of return to the lender equal to 11.5 , less the total of all quarterly interest and revenue participation payments previously paid. See Note 8 - Long-Term Debt, Net of Debt Discount and Financing Fees and Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies.

Sources of Capital 
 Our expected future capital requirements may depend on many factors including expanding our customer base and sales force and timing and extent of spending in obtaining regulatory approval and introduction of new products. Additional sources of liquidity available to us include issuance of additional equity securities through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or from other sources. The sale of additional equity may result in dilution to our shareholders. Although we have an effective shelf registration statement, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The increasing need for capital could also make it more difficult to obtain funding through either equity or debt. Should additional capital not become available to us as needed, we may be required to take certain actions, such as slowing sales and marketing expansion, delaying regulatory approvals, or reducing headcount.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 For a discussion of our market risks, refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The amount of interest expense on the outstanding debt is based on Adjusted SOFR. C hanges in the Adjusted SOFR rate may affect our interest expense associated with the Credit Facility. Based on the outstanding balance of the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the applicable rate would result in an increase to our annual interest expense of approximately 500.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and Board of Directors, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives, and we necessarily are required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during th e three months e nded September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
