 15

to years. At the majority of the U.S. airports, the lease rates depend on airport operating costs or use of the facilities and are reset at least annually, and because of the variable nature of the rates, these leases are not recorded on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

 The Company is party to certain aircraft purchase agreements with Airbus (as amended from time to time, the Airbus Purchase Agreements pursuant to which, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had commitments to purchase an aggregate of A320neo and A321neo aircraft, with deliveries expected through 2031 per the latest delivery schedule. 
 The Airbus Purchase Agreements also provide for, among other things, varying purchase incentives for each aircraft type (e.g., A320neo versus A321neo), which are allocated proportionally by aircraft type over the remaining aircraft to be delivered so that each aircraft s capitalized cost upon induction would be equal. Therefore, as cash paid for deliveries is greater than the capitalized cost due to the allocation of these purchase incentives, a deferred purchase incentive is recognized, which will ultimately be offset by future deliveries of aircraft with lower cash payments than their associated capitalized cost. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had million and million, respectively, of deferred purchase incentives recognized within other assets on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Litigation and Other Contingencies 
 The Company is subject to commercial litigation claims and to administrative and regulatory proceedings and reviews that may be asserted or maintained from time to time. During 2023, the DOT sent the Company a request for information to assist in its investigation into whether the Company cared for its customers as required by law during Winter Storm Elliott, which caused significant operational disruptions and spanned from December 21, 2022 to January 2, 2023, including providing adequate customer service assistance, prompt flight status notifications, and proper and timely refunds. The Company is fully cooperating with the DOT request. 
 The Company regularly evaluates the status of such matters to assess whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable in determining whether an accrual is appropriate. Furthermore, in determining whether disclosure is appropriate, the Company evaluates each matter to assess if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional losses may have been incurred and whether an estimate of possible loss or range of loss can be made. 
 The ultimate outcome of legal actions is unpredictable and can be subject to significant uncertainties, and it is difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. Additionally, it is also difficult to estimate the amount of loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Thus, actual losses may be in excess of any recorded liability or the range of reasonably possible loss. The Company believes the ultimate outcome of any potential lawsuits, proceedings and reviews will likely not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its condensed consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations and that the Company s current accruals cover matters where loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. 
 In situations where the Company may be a plaintiff and receives, or expects to receive, a favorable ruling related to litigation, the Company follows the accounting standards codification guidance for gain contingencies. The Company does not recognize a gain contingency within its condensed consolidated financial statements prior to the settlement of the underlying events or contingencies associated with the gain contingency. As a result, the consideration related to a gain contingency is recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements during the period in which all underlying events or contingencies are resolved and the gain is realized. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company agreed to settlement with a former aircraft lessor regarding a breach of contract for million in damages. The settlement amount is final and may not be appealed further by either party. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the million was recognized within other operating expenses on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, million was included as a component of accounts receivable on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets and final cash proceeds were received in October 2024.

 The Company is self-insured for health care claims, subject to a stop-loss policy, for eligible participating employees and qualified dependent medical and dental claims, subject to deductibles and limitations. The Company s liabilities for claims incurred but not reported are determined based on an estimate of the ultimate aggregate liability for claims incurred. The estimate is calculated from actual claim rates and adjusted periodically as necessary. The Company had accrued million and million for health care claims estimated to be incurred but not yet paid, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which are included as a component of other current liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 General Indemnifications 
 The Company has various leases with respect to real property as well as various agreements among airlines relating to fuel consortia or fuel farms at airports. Under some of these contracts, the Company is party to joint and several liability regarding environmental damages. Under others, where the Company is a member of an LLC or other entity that contracts directly with the airport operator, liabilities are borne through the fuel consortia structure. 
 The Company s aircraft, services, equipment lease and sale and financing agreements typically contain provisions requiring the Company, as the lessee, obligor or recipient of services, to indemnify the other parties to those agreements, including certain of those parties related persons, against virtually any liabilities that might arise from the use or operation of the aircraft or such other equipment. The Company believes that its insurance would cover most of its exposure to liabilities and related indemnities associated with the commercial real estate leases and aircraft, services, equipment lease and sale and financing agreements described above. 
 Certain of the Company s aircraft and other financing transactions include provisions that require payments to preserve an expected economic return to the lenders if that economic return is diminished due to certain changes in law or regulations. In certain of these financing transactions and other agreements, the Company also bears the risk of certain changes in tax laws that would subject payments to non-U.S. entities to withholding taxes.

The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a benefit of and a rate of on pre-tax loss and income, respectively . The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to a decrease in the Company s valuation allowance relating to U.S. federal and state net operating losses, partially offset by the non-deductibility of certain executive compensation and other employee benefits. The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the loss before taxes for the quarter coupled with the tax benefits associated with the Company s stock-based compensation arrangements. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax benefits associated with the Company s stock-based compensation arrangements. 
 The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement reporting bases of assets and liabilities. Quarterly, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize deferred income tax assets, and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the Company s deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The Company considers sources of taxable income from prior period carryback periods, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and future projected taxable income when assessing the future realization of deferred tax assets.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024 (the 2023 Annual Report ). 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Financing - In September 2024, we entered into a series of transactions to provide a revolving line of credit, available for general purposes, as well as increased our overall capacity for financing facilities to fund aircraft PDPs. The Revolving Loan Facility provided 205 million of committed funding. We also amended the PDP Financing Facility and entered into the Second PDP Financing Facility and Third PDP Financing Facility, resulting in an overall increase to our Pre-delivery Credit Facilities from 365 million to 478 million. Lastly, we entered into an additional loan facility related to our headquarters building to fund an additional 6 million, bringing the financed total outstanding balance to 12 million. 
 Fleet - We continue to experience delays in the deliveries of Airbus aircraft, which may persist in future periods. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we amended our Airbus Purchase Agreements which amended our aircraft delivery schedule. This amendment deferred previously scheduled firm aircraft delivery dates from 2025 through 2028 to later years, as well as converted certain A320neo aircraft into A321neo aircraft. Please refer to Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement 9. Commitments and Contingencies for the amended delivery schedule. 
 Pratt Whitney - Since 2022, we have begun to introduce aircraft into our fleet that use the Pratt Whitney PW1100 Geared Turbo Fan GTF engine, and we have selected this engine for most of our planned future deliveries. During 2023, Pratt Whitney announced the requirement, mandated by the FAA, for removal of certain engines for inspection due to a possible condition in the powdered metal used to manufacture certain engine parts. This will require accelerated inspection of the PW1100G engine, which we use for certain of our A320neo family aircraft. While this has not impacted our operations through September 30, 2024, these additional inspection and/or maintenance obligations could result in lengthy turnaround times to perform these inspections including any resulting repairs or other modifications that may be identified. This inspection program may have an adverse impact on our operations, particularly if we are required to temporarily take aircraft out of service. We continue to assess the impact on our future capacity plans and we are in communication with Pratt Whitney regarding compensation related to this matter. 
 Legal - During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we agreed to settle a claim against a former aircraft lessor regarding a breach of contract, pursuant to which we received 40 million in damages. The settlement amount is final and may not be appealed by either party. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the 40 million was recognized within other operating expenses on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, 40 million was included as a component of accounts receivable on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, and final cash proceeds were received in October 2024. 
 Labor - We are currently in negotiations with the unions which represent our pilots and flight attendants regarding their next labor contract. 
 Product - During the year, we launched BizFare, a new, cost-effective program for companies that includes benefits like a free carry-on, priority boarding, and Premium seating, with no fees for changes, cancellations, and same day standby. We also introduced UpFront Plus, offering extra legroom and a guaranteed empty middle seat in the first two rows for enhanced comfort and space. Further, The New Frontier introduced clear, upfront pricing and

new options that include certain benefits like no change fees, bags, seat assignments, and more, along with expanded customer benefits and support. 
 Overview 
 The following table provides select financial and operational information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively (in millions): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total operating revenues 935 883 2,773 2,698 Total operating expenses 916 937 2,760 2,698 Income (loss) before income taxes 27 (45) 35 26 Available seat miles ASMs 10,075 9,697 30,073 27,809 
 Revenues 
 Total operating revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 935 million, an increase of 6 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to the 4 increase in capacity, as measured by ASMs, as well as a 2 increase in revenue per available seat mile RASM ). The increase in RASM is driven by 15 higher enplanements partially offset by 8 lower total revenue per passenger on a 14 decrease in average stage length as compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
 Total operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2,773 million, an increase of 3 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to the 8 increase in capacity, as measured by ASMs, partially offset by a 5 decrease in RASM driven by an 8 decline in total revenue per passenger, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 916 million, resulting in a cost per available seat mile CASM of 9.10 , a decrease of 6 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Fuel expense was 10 lower, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. The 30 million decrease in fuel expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding prior year period, was primarily driven by the 13 decrease in fuel cost per gallon, partially offset by the 4 increase in fuel gallons consumed, as a result of our 4 capacity increase. 
 Our non-fuel expenses increased by 1 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding prior year period, driven primarily by higher capacity and larger fleet size and the resulting increase in operations during the same period. This movement was partially offset by an increase in sale-leaseback gains and a legal settlement, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. CASM (excluding fuel), a non-GAAP measure, decreased by 2 to 6.51 on a 4 increase in capacity for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in sale-leaseback gains and a legal settlement. This movement was partially offset by increases in stations costs due to a lower stage length on higher departures and higher aircraft rent expense due to increases to the fleet size. 
 Adjusted (non-GAAP) CASM (excluding fuel) increased from 6.66 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.89 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, this excludes the impact of 38 million relating to the legal settlement. There were no adjustments for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2,760 million, resulting in a CASM of 9.18 , a decrease of 5 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Fuel expense was 
 25 

15 million lower, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. This 2 decrease in fuel expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding prior year period, was primarily driven by the 8 decrease in fuel cost per gallon, partially offset by the 7 increase in fuel gallons consumed, as a result of our 8 capacity increase. 
 Our non-fuel expenses increased by 4 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding prior year period, driven primarily by higher capacity and larger fleet size and the resulting increase in operations during the same period, partially offset by an increase in sale-leaseback gains and a legal settlement. CASM (excluding fuel) decreased by 4 to 6.48 on an 8 increase in capacity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.73 in the corresponding period year period. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in sale-leaseback gains and a legal settlement, partially offset by higher station and crew costs due to a lower stage length on higher departures, and aircraft rent expense due to increases to the fleet size. 
 Adjusted CASM (excluding fuel) decreased from 6.72 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.60 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this excludes the impact of the 38 million relating to the legal settlement, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, this excludes the impact of 1 million in net transaction and merger-related costs. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 We generated net income of 26 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 32 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Considering these aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments and related tax impacts, as well as the write-off of 1 million in unamortized deferred financing costs for the current year period, our adjusted (non-GAAP) net loss was 11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an adjusted net loss of 32 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We generated net income of 31 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 26 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Considering these aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments and related tax impacts, as well as the 5 million valuation allowance and the write-off of 1 million in unamortized deferred financing costs for the current year period, our adjusted net loss was 1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an adjusted net income of 27 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjusted measures, see Results of Operations Reconciliation of CASM to CASM (excluding fuel), Adjusted CASM (excluding fuel), Adjusted CASM, Adjusted CASM including net interest and CASM including net interest and Results of Operations Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Pre-Tax Income (Loss) to Adjusted Pre-Tax Income (Loss), and Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA, EBITDAR, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDAR . 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total available liquidity was 576 million, made up of cash and cash equivalents, and we have 205 million of funds available to be drawn under our revolving loan facility.

 Total operating revenue increased 52 million, or 6 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by 4 capacity growth, as measured by ASMs, and a 2 increase in RASM. The increase in RASM is driven by the 15 higher enplanements partially offset by an 8 decline in total revenue per passenger and a 2-point reduction in load factor on a 14 decrease in average stage length. The lower total revenue per passenger was the result of lower ancillary revenue per passenger. The increase in capacity was driven by the 17 increase in average aircraft in service during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a 10 decrease in aircraft utilization as compared to the corresponding prior year period.

 Aircraft Fuel . Aircraft fuel expense decreased by 30 million, or 10 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the 13 decrease in fuel cost per gallon, partially offset by the 4 increase in fuel gallons consumed, driven by higher capacity. 
 Salaries, Wages and Benefits . Salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by 15 million, or 7 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher crew costs, driven primarily by elevated credit hours on higher capacity and other benefit costs, as well as an increase in headcount of salaried support staff, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
 Aircraft Rent . Aircraft rent expense increased by 27 million, or 18 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 17 larger fleet. 
 Station Operations . Station operations expense increased by 31 million, or 23 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased airport operations as a result of the 17 increase in departures and 15 increase in passengers partially offset by increased benefits from airport revenue and cost sharing arrangements.

Maintenance, Materials and Repairs . Maintenance, materials and repair expense increased by 5 million, or 10 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the 17 increase in average aircraft in service, which resulted in higher aircraft maintenance costs, partially offset by lower contract labor costs. 
 Sales and Marketing . Sales and marketing expense increased by 5 million, or 12 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the increase in credit card and third-party distribution channel fees as a result of a 6 increase in revenue.

 Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 6 million, or 46 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in capitalized maintenance depreciation due to our growing fleet. 
 Other Operating . Other operating resulted in a net gain of 40 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an expense of 40 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This movement was primarily driven by a legal settlement gain of 40 million and the increase in sale-leaseback gains, as a result of five aircraft inductions subject to sale-leaseback transactions in the current period, compared to three aircraft induction subject to sale-leaseback transactions in the corresponding prior year period. 
 Other Income (Expense). Other income decreased by 1 million, or 11 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the 1 million loss on extinguishment of debt from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing cost related to the PDP Financing Facility. 
 Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was an expense of 3.7 on pre-tax income, compared to a benefit of 28.9 on a pre-tax loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate is related to a decrease in our valuation allowance relating to federal and state net operating losses.

 Total operating revenue increased 75 million, or 3 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. While capacity grew by 8 , as measured by ASMs, revenue was unfavorably impacted by a 5 decline in RASM due to the 8 decline in total revenue per passenger as well as a 6-point reduction in load factor, partially offset by a reduction in stage length of 12 on a 12 increase in passengers. The increase in capacity was driven by the 16 increase in average aircraft in service during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a 7 decrease in average daily aircraft utilization to 10.6 hours per day compared to 11.4 hours per day for the corresponding prior year period.

For the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjusted measures, see Reconciliation of CASM to CASM (excluding fuel), Adjusted CASM (excluding fuel), Adjusted CASM, Adjusted CASM including net interest and CASM including net interest . 
 Aircraft Fuel . Aircraft fuel expense decreased by 15 million, or 2 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the 8 decrease in fuel cost per gallon, partially offset by the 7 increase in fuel gallons consumed, driven by higher capacity. 
 Salaries, Wages and Benefits . Salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by 78 million, or 12 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to higher crew costs, driven primarily by elevated credit hours on higher capacity and other benefit costs, as well as an increased headcount of salaried support staff, as compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
 Aircraft Rent . Aircraft rent expense increased by 54 million, or 13 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a larger fleet, partially offset by a decrease in aircraft lease return costs. 
 Station Operations . Station operations expense increased by 83 million, or 22 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased airport operations as a result of the 19 increase in departures and 12 increase in passengers partially offset by increased benefits from airport revenue and cost sharing arrangements. 
 31 

Maintenance, Materials and Repairs . Maintenance, materials and repair expense decreased by 1 million, or 1 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower contract labor, partially offset by a 16 increase in average aircraft in service, which resulted in higher aircraft repair and maintenance costs. 
 Sales and Marketing . Sales and marketing expense increased by 8 million, or 6 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in customer reservation system fees and increase in paid media advertising.

 Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 17 million, or 47 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in capitalized maintenance depreciation due to our growing fleet. 
 Other Operating . Other operat ing resulted in a net gain of 42 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an expense of 120 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This movement was primarily driven by a legal settlement gain of 40 million and the increase in sale-leaseback gains, as a result of 17 aircraft inductions subject to sale-leaseback transactions in the current period, compared to seven aircraft inductions subject to sale-leaseback transactions in the corresponding prior year period. 
 Other Income (Expense). Other income decreased by 4 million, or 15 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest income from lower balances in interest-bearing cash accounts and the 1 million loss on extinguishment of debt from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing cost related to the PDP Financing Facility. 
 Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an expense of 11.4 , compared to an expense of 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, on pre-tax income for both periods. The primary difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is related to a decrease in our valuation allowance relating to federal and state net operating losses, partially offset by the impact of non-deductibility of certain executive compensation and other employee benefits. Please refer to Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 11. Income Taxes for additional information.

 (a) Cost per ASM figures may not recalculate due to rounding. 
 (b) CASM (excluding fuel) and Adjusted CASM (excluding fuel) are included as supplemental disclosures because we believe that excluding aircraft fuel is useful to investors as it provides an additional measure of management s performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. The price of fuel, over which we have limited control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance, and excluding the price of fuel allows management an additional tool to understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and core operating performance, and increases comparability with other airlines that also provide a similar metric. CASM (excluding fuel) and Adjusted CASM (excluding fuel) are not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 (c) We reached a legal settlement with a former lessor for breach of contract for a total of 40 million (please refer to Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement 9. Commitments and Contingencies for additional information). 38 million of the settlement represents a one-time reimbursement of damages incurred and 2 million relates to the reimbursement of previously recorded legal expenses. 
 (d) Adjusted CASM is included as supplemental disclosure because we believe it is a useful metric to properly compare our cost management and performance to other peers, as derivations of Adjusted CASM are well-recognized performance measurements in the airline industry that are frequently used by our management, as well as by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies in the airline industry. Additionally, we believe this metric is useful because it removes certain items that may not be indicative of base operating performance or future results. Adjusted CASM is not determined in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable across all carriers and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 (e) In September 2024, we reduced the capacity of the PDP Financing Facility from 365 million to 135 million. The downsize of the facility resulted in a one-time write-off of 1 million in unamortized deferred financing costs. This amount is a component of interest expense within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 (f) Adjusted CASM including net interest and CASM including net interest are included as supplemental disclosures because we believe they are useful metrics to properly compare our cost management and performance to other peers that may have different capital structures and financing strategies, particularly as it relates to financing primary operating assets such as aircraft and engines.

 (a) Adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are included as supplemental disclosures because we believe they are useful indicators of our operating performance. Derivations of pre-tax income (loss), net income (loss) and EBITDA are well-recognized performance measurements in the airline industry that are frequently used by our management, as well as by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies in our industry. 
 Adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools. Some of the limitations applicable to these measures include: adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness or possible cash requirements related to our warrants; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because derivations of adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, derivations of pre-tax income (loss), net income (loss) and EBITDA, including adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA, as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 
 For the foregoing reasons, each of adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA has significant limitations which affect its use as an indicator of our profitability. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information. 
 (b) EBITDAR and adjusted EBITDAR are included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe them to be useful solely as valuation metrics for airlines as their calculations isolate the effects of financing in general, the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions (primarily aircraft, which may be acquired directly, directly subject to acquisition debt, by capital lease or by operating lease, each of which is presented differently for accounting purposes), and income taxes, which may vary significantly between periods and for different airlines for reasons unrelated to the underlying value of a particular airline. However, EBITDAR and adjusted EBITDAR are not determined in accordance with GAAP, are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measure in the same manner. As a result, EBITDAR and adjusted EBITDAR, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. In addition, EBITDAR and adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall performance since they exclude aircraft rent, which is a normal, recurring cash operating expense that is necessary to operate our business. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total available liquidity was 576 million, made up of cash and cash equivalents, and we have 205 million of funds available to be drawn under our Revolving Loan Facility. We had 469 million of total debt, net, of which 190 million is short-term and consists primarily of amounts outstanding under our Pre-delivery Credit Facilities. Our total debt, net is comprised of 296 million outstanding under our Pre-delivery Credit Facilities, 100 million outstanding under our pre-purchased miles facility with Barclays Bank Delaware Barclays ), 66 million in 10-year, low-interest loans from the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury, and such loans, the PSP Promissory Notes and 12 million in secured indebtedness for our headquarters building, partially offset by 5 million in deferred debt acquisition costs. 
 In September 2024, we entered into a series of transactions designed to provide us with a revolving line of credit available for general corporate purposes as well as increased capacity for financing facilities intended to fund aircraft PDPs. The new pre-delivery credit facilities, which consist of the Second PDP Financing Facility and the Third PDP Financing Facility, in addition to the pre-existing PDP Financing Facility, increased overall borrowing capacity from 365 million to 478 million. We also entered into the Revolving Loan Facility, which provided 205 million of commitments secured by our loyalty program and brand-related assets which was undrawn as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we increased our borrowings under the Barclays agreement by an additional 20 million. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid the remaining outstanding balance, inclusive of any unpaid principal, interest and other amounts related to our previous headquarters note and subsequent to the payoff of the headquarters note, we entered into multiple loan agreements in the total amount of 12 million with a different lender secured by our headquarters. Please refer to Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 6. Debt for additional information. 
 In connection with the PSP Promissory Notes and the term loan facility entered into with the Treasury on September 28, 2020, which was repaid in full on February 2, 2022, we issued warrants to purchase 3,117,940 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of 6.95 per share. We have the intent and ability to settle the warrants issued in common shares and we have classified the warrant liability to additional paid-in-capital on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. These warrants will expire between May 2025 and June 2026. No warrants have been exercised as of September 30, 2024. 
 We continue to monitor our covenant compliance with various parties, including, but not limited to, our lenders and credit card processors. As of the date of this report, we are in compliance with all of our covenants.

Use of Cash and Future Obligations 
 We expect to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months through use of our available cash and cash equivalents, our Pre-delivery Credit Facilities, and cash flows from operating activities. We expect to meet our long-term cash requirements with cash flows from operating and financing activities, including, but not limited to, potential future borrowings under the Pre-delivery Credit Facilities, our undrawn Revolving Loan Facility and/or potential issuances of debt or equity. The Revolving Loan Facility also permits us to enter into additional indebtedness secured by our loyalty program and brand-related assets, to the extent such indebtedness is pari passu to that of the Revolving Loan Facility. Our primary uses of cash are for working capital, aircraft PDPs, debt repayments and capital expenditures. 
 Our single largest capital commitment relates to the acquisition of aircraft. As of September 30, 2024, we operated all of our 153 aircraft under operating leases. PDPs relating to future deliveries under our agreement with Airbus are required at various times prior to each aircraft s delivery date. As of September 30, 2024, our Pre-delivery Credit Facilities, which allow us to draw up to an aggregate of 478 million, had 296 million outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, we had 390 million of PDPs held by Airbus which have been partially financed by our Pre-delivery Credit Facilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a firm obligation to purchase 193 A320neo family aircraft and 13 additional spare engines to be delivered by 2031. Of our aircraft commitments, 23 had committed operating leases for deliveries occurring between 2024 and 2026, and 12 were subject to non-binding letters of intent to provide operating lease financing for 2024 and 2025 deliveries. We intend to evaluate financing options for the remaining aircraft. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reached an agreement with one of our aircraft lessors which eliminated requirements to pay maintenance reserves held as collateral in advance of our required performance of major maintenance activities on its aircraft leases. As a result of the agreement, the lessor disbursed back to us previously paid aircraft maintenance deposits of approximately 104 million, resulting in us no longer having any aircraft maintenance deposits with any of our lessors as of September 30, 2024. 
 The following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of September 30, 2024, which we expect to fund primarily with operating and financing cash flows (in millions): Material Cash Requirements Remainder of 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Debt obligations (a)

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks include commodity price risk, with respect to aircraft fuel, as well as interest rate risk, specifically with respect to our floating rate obligations and aircraft lease contracts. The adverse effects of changes in these markets could pose a potential loss as discussed below. The sensitivity analysis provided does not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor does it consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results may differ. 
 Aircraft Fuel . Our results of operations can vary materially due to changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel and are also impacted by the number of aircraft in use and the number of flights we operate. Aircraft fuel represented approximately 28 and 29 of total operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 31 of total operating expenses for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Unexpected changes in the pricing of aircraft fuel or a shortage or disruption in the supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Based on our fuel consumption for the 12 months ended September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10 increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel would have increased aircraft fuel expense by approximately 112 million. 
 Interest Rates . We are subject to market risk associated with changing interest rates, due to Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR based interest rates on our PDP Financing Facility, Second PDP Financing Facility and Revolving Loan Facility, which remains undrawn as of September 30, 2024, as well as Effective Federal Funds Rate EFFR based interest rates on our affinity card advance purchase of miles with Barclays. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as applied to our average debt balances, a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates on our variable-rate debt would have increased the annual interest expense by 3 million. 
 We are also exposed to interest rate risk through aircraft lease contracts for the time period between agreement of terms and commencement of the lease, where portions of the rental payments are adjusted and become fixed based on swap rates. As part of our risk management program, we have historically entered into contracts in order to limit the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. During each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not enter into any swaps and, therefore, paid no upfront premiums for interest rate hedges. As of September 30, 2024, we had no interest rate hedges outstanding. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.

Where an Operative Document requires any party to reimburse the Lender for any costs or expenses, that party shall also at the same time pay and indemnify the Lender against all VAT incurred by the Lender in respect of the costs or expenses to the extent that the Lender reasonably determines that neither it nor any other member of any group of which it is a member for VAT purposes is entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant Tax authority in respect of the VAT.

attributable to the maintenance by such Lender (or any lending office or such bank holding company) of capital in respect of the Commitments or Loan of such Lender hereunder, pursuant to any law or regulation or any interpretation, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law and whether or not failure to comply therewith would be unlawful so long as compliance therewith is standard banking practice in the relevant jurisdiction) of any court or governmental or monetary authority following

 (c) Clauses 5.11(d) and (e) apply in respect of this Clause 5.11. 
 (d) Each Lender shall notify the Borrower of any event occurring after the Effective Date entitling such Lender to compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Clause 5.11 as promptly as practicable, but in any event within , after such Lender obtains actual knowledge thereof provided that (i) such Lender shall, with respect to compensation payable pursuant to this Clause 5.11 in respect of any Additional Costs resulting from such event, only be entitled to payment under this Clause 5.11 for Additional Costs incurred from and after the date that is prior to the date of receipt of such notice by the Borrower, (ii) each Lender will use commercially reasonable efforts (at the Borrower's expense) to mitigate the amount of compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Clause 5.11 associated with such event, including designating a different lending office for the Loan evidenced by such Lender's Loan Certificate affected by such event if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole opinion of such Lender, result in any economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage to such Lender, and (iii) no Lender shall discriminate against the Borrower in making any claim for compensation under this Clause 5.11, and no Lender shall treat the Borrower less favorably than such 
 25 
 US-DOCS 151480408.12 

Lender's other similarly situated borrowers.

5.13 Inability to Determine Rates . 
 Subject to Clause 5.14, if, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any SOFR Loan 
 (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or 
 (b) the Majority Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, and the Required Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, 
 the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. 
 Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert ABR Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent (with respect to clause (b), at the instruction of the Majority Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Clause 5.11. Subject to Clause 5.14, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the interest rate on ABR Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of ABR until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination.

 28 
 US-DOCS 151480408.12 

Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 
 (e) Benchmark Unavailability Period . Upon the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a SOFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans. During a Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR. 
 6. TERMINATION OF INTEREST IN COLLATERAL

 15.6 To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim,

 (g) Each Lender hereby agrees to indemnify the Borrower or the Security Trustee, as the case may be, for any Taxes of a type collected by way of withholding which the Borrower or the Security Trustee fails to withhold on payments to such Lender as a direct result of the failure of such Lender to provide the form or certificate required to be provided by such Lender by Clause 5.3(d) or the invalidity of any such form or certificate required to be provided by such Lender by Clause 5.3(d). 
 (h) Without limiting the foregoing, each Person that is an assignee of a Lender pursuant to Clause 5.6 and or Clause 19.3(b) shall, upon the effectiveness of such transfer, be required to provide all of the forms and statements to the extent required pursuant to this Clause 5.3.

Where an Operative Document requires any party to reimburse the Lender for any costs or expenses, that party shall also at the same time pay and indemnify the Lender against all VAT incurred by the Lender in respect of the costs or expenses to the extent that the Lender reasonably determines that neither it nor any other member of any group of which it is a member for VAT purposes is entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of the VAT. 
 (l) If a payment made to a Lender under any Operative Document would be subject to withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Security Trustee at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Security Trustee such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law including as prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Security Trustee as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Security Trustee to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

 15.5 The parties hereto agree that (x) irrespective of whether the Facility Agent may be equitably subrogated, in the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Payment Recipient that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Facility Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights and interests of such Payment Recipient (and, in the case of any Payment Recipient who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Party, to the rights and interests of such Lender, Issuing Bank or Secured Party, as the case may be) under the Operative Documents with respect to such amount (the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights (provided that the Obligors' Secured Obligations under the Operative Documents in respect of the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights shall not be duplicative of such Secured Obligations in respect of Loans that have been assigned to the Facility Agent under an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment) and (y) an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Secured Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party provided that this Clause 15 shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the Obligations of the Borrower relative to the amount (and or timing for payment) of the Obligations that would have been payable had such Erroneous Payment not been made by the Facility Agent provided, further, that for the avoidance of doubt, immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y) shall not apply to the extent any such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Facility Agent from the Borrower for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment. 
 15.6 To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Facility Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including, without limitation, any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine.

If a Lender fails to give written notice fifteen (15) days prior to the relevant Payment Date, such additional interest or cost shall be due and payable fifteen (15) days from receipt of such notice.

The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount due within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such certificate. 
 (e) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the one hundred eighty (180) day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. The protection of this Section 2.14 shall be available to each Lender regardless of any possible contention as to the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other change or condition which shall have occurred or been imposed. 
 76 

(f) The Borrowers shall not be required to make payments under this Section 2.14 to any Lender if (A) a claim hereunder arises solely through circumstances peculiar to such Lender and which do not affect commercial banks in the jurisdiction of organization of such Lender generally, (B) the claim arises out of a voluntary relocation by such Lender of its applicable lending office (it being understood that any such relocation effected pursuant to Section 2.18 is not voluntary ), or (C) such Lender is not seeking similar compensation for such costs to which it is entitled from its borrowers generally in commercial loans of a similar size. 
 (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, regulations, requests, rules, guidelines or directives implemented after the Closing Date pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or Basel III shall be deemed to be a Change in Law provided that any determination by a Lender of amounts owed pursuant to this Section 2.14 to such Lender due to any such Change in Law shall be made in good faith in a manner generally consistent with such Lender s standard practice. 
 Section 2.15 Break Funding Payments . In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any SOFR Loan other than on a Payment Date (including as a result of the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default), (b) the failure to borrow or prepay any SOFR Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (other than with respect to a conditional notice that is revoked in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), or (c) the assignment of any SOFR Loan other than on a Payment Date as a result of a request by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.18 or Section 10.08(d) , then, in any such event, at the request of such Lender, the Borrowers shall compensate such Lender for the loss, cost and expense sustained by such Lender attributable to such event provided that in no case shall this Section 2.15 apply to any payment pursuant to Section 2.10(b) . Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount reasonably determined in good faith by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan (excluding, however the Applicable Margin included therein, if any), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts (and the basis for requesting such amount or amounts) that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be prima facie evidence of the amount due (absent manifest error). The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount due within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such certificate. 
 Section 2.16 Taxes . 
 (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any Obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable 
 77 

law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Lender or Agent receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
 (b) In addition (and without duplication of any payments with respect to Other Taxes pursuant to Section 2.16(a) ), the Borrowers shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
 (c) Without duplication of amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.16(a) or 2.16(b) , the Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify each Lender or Agent, within 30 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such person or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such person and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. After an Agent or a Lender, as the case may be, learns of the imposition of any Indemnified Taxes, such party will act in good faith to notify the Borrowers promptly of its obligation thereunder. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender, by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, or by the Collateral Agent on its own behalf, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrowers to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.16 , the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment to the extent available, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
 (e) Each Lender shall, within after written demand therefor, indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent (to the extent the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent has not been reimbursed by the Borrowers) for the full amount of any Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority that are attributable to such Lender and that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, together with all interest, penalties, reasonable costs and expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, as determined by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, respectively in good faith. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
 (h) Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall provide the Borrowers on or prior to the date on which such Agent becomes a party under this Agreement with two (2) properly completed and duly executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that it is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding, with the effect that, in either case, the Borrowers will be legally entitled to make payments hereunder to the Agent without withholding or deduction on account of U.S. federal withholding Tax, and the Agent hereby certifies that it will handle U.S. withholding tax collection (if any required) with respect to payments to the Lenders and shall update such forms periodically upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers.

In the event no successor Collateral Agent shall have been appointed within 30 days after the giving of notice of such resignation, the Collateral Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor Collateral Agent. The Administrative Agent upon at least 30 days prior written notice to the Collateral Agent and the Borrowers, may with or without cause remove and discharge the Collateral Agent or any successor Collateral Agent thereafter appointed from the performance of its duties under this Agreement.

 143 

of its Loans as a result of which the unpaid portion of its Loans is proportionately less than the unpaid portion of the Loans of any other Lender (a) it shall promptly purchase at par (and shall be deemed to have thereupon purchased) from such other Lender a participation in the Loans of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of each Lender s Loans and its participation in Loans of the other Lenders shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans then-outstanding as the principal amount of its Loans prior to the obtaining of such payment was to the principal amount of all Loans outstanding prior to the obtaining of such payment and (b) such other adjustments shall be made from time to time as shall be equitable to ensure that the Lenders share such payment pro-rata, provided that if any such non-pro-rata payment is thereafter recovered or otherwise set aside, such purchase of participations shall be rescinded (without interest). Each Loan Party expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that any Lender holding (or deemed to be holding) a participation in a Loan acquired pursuant to this Section or any of its banking Affiliates may exercise any and all rights of banker s lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by a Loan Party to such Lender as fully as if such Lender was the original obligee thereon, in the amount of such participation.

 (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Guarantors hereby waives any defense that it might have based on a failure to remain informed of the financial condition of the Borrowers and of any other Guarantor and any circumstances affecting the ability of the Borrowers to perform under this Agreement. 
 146 

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor s guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or any other instrument evidencing any Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, or extent of any collateral therefor or by any other circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to this guaranty (other than payment in full in cash of the Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (other than those that constitute unasserted contingent indemnification obligations)). None of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any of the Lenders makes any representation or warranty in respect to any such circumstances or shall have any duty or responsibility whatsoever to any Guarantor in respect of the management and maintenance of the Obligations. 
 (f) Upon the occurrence of the Obligations becoming due and payable (by acceleration or otherwise), the Lenders shall be entitled to immediate payment of such Obligations by the Guarantors upon written demand by the Administrative Agent. 
 (g) The Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Collateral Agent, the other Senior Secured Parties and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of each Guarantor under the guaranties hereunder at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the Obligations of such Guarantor under this guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender, the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register pursuant to the terms hereof as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be permitted to sell participations under this Agreement to any Defaulting Lender, Disqualified Institution or natural person and any such participation shall be void ab initio, except to the extent that the Borrower has consented to such participation in writing (in which case such Lender will not be considered a Defaulting Lender, Disqualified Institution or natural person solely for that particular participation). Any attempted participation which does not comply with Section 10.02 shall be null and void. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant and shall be subject to the terms of Section 2.18(a) .

 (f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 10.02 , disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information relating to the Loan Parties furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of any Loan Party provided that prior to any such disclosure, each such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant provides to the
