 Natural gas Natural gas liquids Total revenues In the Jonah Field, the Company has elected to take its natural gas and NGL working interest production in-kind and markets its NGL production to Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Enterprise and its natural gas production to different purchasers. The Company does not take production in-kind at any of its other properties and does not negotiate contracts with customers for such production. The Company recognizes crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production revenue at the point in time when custody and title control of the product transfers to the customer. The sales of oil and natural gas are made under contracts which the Company s third-party operators of its wells have negotiated with customers, which typically include variable consideration that is based on pricing tied to local indices and volumes delivered in the current month. The Company typically receives payment from the sale of oil and natural gas production one to after delivery. Judgments made in applying the guidance in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , relate primarily to determining the point in time when control of product transfers to the customer. The Company does not believe that significant judgments are required with respect to the determination of the transaction price, including amounts that represent variable consideration, as volume and price carry a low level of estimation uncertainty given the precision of volumetric measurements and the use of index pricing with predictable differentials. Accordingly, the Company does not consider estimates of variable consideration to be constrained. The Company s contractual performance obligations arise upon the production of hydrocarbons from wells in which the Company has an ownership interest. The performance obligations are considered satisfied upon control of produced hydrocarbons transferring to a customer at a specified delivery point. Consideration is allocated to completed performance obligations at the end of an accounting period. Revenue is recorded in the month when contractual performance obligations are satisfied. However, settlement statements from the purchasers of hydrocarbons and the related cash consideration are received by field operators one to before the Company receives payment and documentation from the operator, which is typical in the oil and natural gas industry. As a result, the Company must estimate the amount of production delivered to the customer and the consideration that will ultimately be received for the sale of the product. To estimate accounts receivable from operators contracts with customers, the Company uses knowledge of its properties, information from field operators, historical performance, contractual arrangements, index pricing, quality and transportation differentials, and other factors. Because the contractual performance obligations have been satisfied and an unconditional right to consideration exists as of the balance sheet date, the Company recognized amounts due from contracts with field operators as Receivables from crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids revenues on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Differences between estimates and actual amounts received for product sales are recorded in the month that payments received from purchasers are remitted to the Company by field operators.

 million, which includes million paid at closing less purchase price adjustments totaling approximately million related to net cash flows received on the properties subsequent to closing. The Company accounted for these transactions as asset acquisitions and allocated all of the combined purchase price (including million of transaction costs) to proved oil and natural gas properties. In addition, the Company recognized million in non-cash asset retirement obligations, the estimated net present value of future net retirement costs. The transactions were funded with cash on hand and million in borrowings under the Company s Senior Secured Credit Facility. The acquired assets consist of an average net working interest of approximately , in producing wells in the SCOOP and STACK plays of the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma. Chaveroo Oilfield Participation Agreement On September 12, 2023, the Company entered into a Participation Agreement with PEDEVCO for the joint development of a portion of PEDEVCO s Permian Basin property in the Chaveroo oilfield, located in Chaves and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico. In accordance with the Participation Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to elect to participate and acquire a working interest share in certain development blocks at a fixed price of per net acre for up to a total of approximately gross acres. The Participation Agreement does not include any of PEDEVCO s existing vertical or horizontal wells. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred approximately million in exchange for a working interest share in the existing leases associated with development blocks. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has participated in the drilling and completion of the first development block, consisting of gross wells net wells) and has committed to participate in the next four drilling locations during fiscal 2025. Less: Accumulated depletion, depreciation, and impairment ) ) Oil and natural gas properties, net The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and natural gas properties. All costs of acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized as the cost of oil and natural gas properties when incurred. To the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depletion, exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, net of deferred taxes, such excess capitalized costs would be charged to expense as a write-down of oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, the Company assesses all properties classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment. The Company assesses properties on an individual basis or as a group, if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of the following factors, among others: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate

 million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred development capital expenditures of million and million, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the ceiling test value of the Company s reserves was calculated based on the first-day-of-the-month average for the 12-months ended September 30, 2024 of the West Texas Intermediate WTI crude oil spot price of per barrel and Henry Hub natural gas spot price of per MMBtu, adjusted by market differentials by field. The net price per barrel of NGLs was , which was based on historical differentials to WTI as NGLs do not have any single comparable reference index price. Using these prices, at September 30, 2024 the cost center ceiling was higher than the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties and, as a result, write-down was applicable. At September 30, 2023, the ceiling test value of the Company s reserves was calculated based on the first-day-of the month average for the 12-months ended September 30, 2023 of the WTI crude oil spot price of per barrel and Henry Hub natural gas spot price of per MMBtu, adjusted by market differentials by field. The net price per barrel of NGLs was , which was based on historical prices received as NGLs do not have any single comparable reference index price. Using these prices, at September 30, 2023 the cost center ceiling was higher than the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties and, as a result, write-down was applicable. million with a current borrowing base of million. On May 5, 2023, the Company entered into the Tenth Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility extending the maturity to . The Tenth Amendment also replaced the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of to effectively convert SOFR to a LIBOR equivalent and modifies the Margined Collateral Value, as defined in the Ninth Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, to million. The borrowing base will be redetermined semiannually, with the lenders and the Company each having the right to interim unscheduled redetermination between any two consecutive semi-annual redeterminations. The borrowing base takes into account the estimated value of the Company s oil and natural gas properties, proved reserves, total indebtedness, and other relevant factors consistent with customary oil and natural gas lending criteria. The Senior Secured Credit Facility carries a commitment fee of per annum on the undrawn portion of the borrowing base. Any borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will bear interest, at the Company s option, at either SOFR plus , subject to a minimum SOFR of , or the Prime Rate, as defined under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, plus . The Company may elect, at its option, to prepay any borrowings outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility without premium or penalty. Amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company s direct and indirect subsidiaries and secured by a security interest in substantially all of the properties of the Company and its subsidiaries. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility may be used for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties, investments in cash flow generating properties complimentary to the production of oil and natural gas, and for letters of credit or other general corporate purposes. The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains certain events of default, including non-payment; breaches or representation and warranties; non-compliance with covenants; cross-defaults to material indebtedness; voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy; judgments and change in control. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also contains financial covenants including a requirement that the Company maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (i) a maximum total leverage ratio of not more than to 1.00, (ii) a current ratio of not less than to 1.00, and (iii) a consolidated tangible net worth of not less than million, each as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million borrowings outstanding under its Senior Secured Credit Facility, resulting in million of available borrowing capacity. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the

 . The Senior Credit Agreement also contains hedging requirements that apply when there is or more utilization of the Margined Collateral Value, as defined above, to the extent it exceeds the borrowing base then in effect. On February 12, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility. This amendment required that the Company enter into hedges for the next period, and on a rolling basis thereafter, covering expected crude oil and natural gas production from proved developed reserves, calculated separately, equal to a minimum of of expected crude oil production each month, or of expected crude oil and natural gas production each month over that period. Thus, the Company has the option to choose whether to hedge of expected crude oil production or each of expected crude oil and natural gas production.

The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on the Company s tax returns and that the accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. The Company s federal and state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 through June 30, 2023 for federal tax purposes and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 through June 30, 2023 for state tax purposes. To the extent the Company utilizes net operating losses NOLs generated in earlier years, such earlier years may also be subject to audit. For three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized income tax expense of million and had an effective tax rate of compared to income tax expense of million and an effective tax rate of for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s effective tax rate will typically differ from the statutory federal rate as a result of state income taxes, primarily in the states of Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota and Texas, percentage depletion in excess of basis, and other permanent differences. For both periods, the respective statutory federal tax rate was .

The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will depend on a variety of factors, including management s assessment of the intrinsic value of the Company s shares, the market price of the Company s common stock, the Company s capital needs and resources, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal requirements. The value of shares authorized for repurchase by the Company s Board of Directors does not require the Company to repurchase such shares or guarantee that such shares will be repurchased, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock under the plan during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Since the plan s inception in September 2022, a total of million shares of the Company s common stock have been repurchased under the plan at a total cost of approximately million, including incremental direct transaction costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company acquired treasury stock upon the ordinary course of scheduled vestings of employee stock-based awards to fund payroll tax withholding obligations. These treasury shares were subsequently cancelled. Such shares were valued at fair market value on the date of vesting. Average cost per share Total cost of treasury shares acquired Expected Tax Treatment of Dividends For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, all common stock dividends for that fiscal year were treated for tax purposes as qualified dividend income to the recipients. Based on its current projections for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company expects all common stock dividends for such period to be treated as qualified dividend income to the recipients. Such projections are based on the Company s reasonable expectations as of September 30, 2024 and are subject to change based on the Company s final tax calculations at the end of the fiscal year. Stock-Based Incentive Plan The Evolution Petroleum Corporation 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the 2016 Plan authorizes the issuance of million shares of common stock prior to its expiration on December 8, 2026. Incentives under the 2016 Plan may be granted to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company in any one or a combination of the following forms: incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, performance share awards, performance cash awards, and other forms of incentives valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, the Company s common stock, including its appreciation in value. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, approximately million shares and million shares, respectively, remained available for grant under the 2016 Plan. Subject to shareholder approval at the December 5, 2024 annual meeting, the Board of Directors approved and adopted an amended and restated 2016 Plan (the "Amended and Restated Plan on October 18, 2024, which would authorize an additional million shares for issuance under the Amended and

 million and million, respectively, related to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded as a component of General and administrative expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Time-Vested Restricted Stock Awards Time-vested restricted stock awards contain service-based vesting conditions and expire after a maximum of four years from the date of grant if unvested. The common shares underlying these awards are issued on the date of grant and participate in dividends paid by the Company. These service-based awards vest with continuous employment by the Company, generally in annual installments over terms of three to . Awards to the Company s directors generally have cliff vesting. For such awards, grant date fair value is based on market value of the Company s common stock at the time of grant. This value is then amortized ratably over the service period. Previously recognized amortization expense subsequent to the last vesting date of an award is reversed in the event that the holder has no longer rendered service to the Company resulting in forfeiture of the award. Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards and Performance-Based Contingent Stock Units Performance-based restricted stock awards and performance-based contingent stock units contain market-based vesting conditions based on the price of the Company s common stock, the intrinsic value indexed solely to its common stock or the intrinsic value indexed to its common stock compared to the performance of the common stock of its peers. The common shares underlying the Company s performance-based restricted stock awards are issued on the date of grant and participate in dividends paid by the Company and expire after a maximum of four years from the date of grant if unvested. Performance-based contingent share units do not participate in dividends and shares are only issued in part or in full upon the attainment of vesting conditions, generally have a lower probability of achievement and expire after a maximum of four years from the date of grant if unvested. Shares underlying performance-based contingent share units are reserved from the 2016 Plan. Performance-based restricted stock awards and contingent restricted stock units are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation and geometric Brownian motion techniques applied to the historical volatility of the Company s total stock return compared to the historical volatilities of other companies or indices to which the Company compares its performance and/or the Company s absolute total stock return. For certain awards, this Monte Carlo simulation also provides an expected vesting term. Stock-based compensation is recognized ratably over the expected vesting period, so long as the award holder remains an employee of the Company. Previously recognized compensation expense is only reversed for the awards with market-based vesting conditions if the requisite service period is not rendered by the holder resulting in forfeiture of the award or as a result of regulatory required clawback. Vesting of grants with performance-based vesting conditions is dependent on the future price of the Company s common stock. Such awards vest in part or in full if the trailing total returns on the Company s common stock for a specified period exceed the corresponding total returns of various quartiles of indices consisting of peer companies. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted a total of million equity awards that included million time-vested restricted stock awards, million performance-based restricted stock awards, and million performance-based contingent stock units. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company granted a total of million equity awards that included million time-vested restricted stock awards, million performance-based restricted stock awards, and million of performance-based contingent stock units.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview Liquidity and Capital Resources Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Commonly Used Terms Current quarter refers to the three months ended September 30, 2024, our first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Year-ago quarter refers to the three months ended September 30, 2023, our first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Executive Overview General Evolution Petroleum Corporation is an independent energy company focused on maximizing total returns to its shareholders through the ownership of and investment in onshore oil and natural gas properties in the United States. In support of that objective, our long-term goal is to maximize total shareholder return from a diversified portfolio of long-life oil and natural gas properties built through acquisitions and through selective development opportunities, production enhancements, and other exploitation efforts on our oil and natural gas properties. Our oil and natural gas properties consist of non-operated interests in the SCOOP and STACK plays of the Anadarko Basin located in central Oklahoma; the Chaveroo oilfield in Chaves and Roosevelt Counties of New Mexico; Jonah Field in Sublette County, Wyoming; the Williston Basin in North Dakota; the Barnett Shale located in North Texas; the Hamilton Dome Field located in Hot Springs County, Wyoming; the Delhi Holt-Bryant Unit in the Delhi Field in Northeast Louisiana; and small overriding royalty interests in four onshore central Texas wells. Our non-operated interests in the SCOOP and STACK plays consist of oil and natural gas producing properties in the Anadarko basin, where we hold approximately 2.6 average net working interest and approximately 2.0 average net revenue interests located on approximately 103,700 gross or 4,200 net acres (approximately 96 held by production), across Blaine, Canadian, Carter, Custer, Dewey, Garvin, Grady, Kingfisher, McClain, Murray, and Stephens counties in Oklahoma. The oil and natural gas properties are operated by Continental Resources, Inc., Ovintiv USA Inc. and EOG Resources, Inc. with approximately 40 of wells operated by other operators. Our non-operated interests in the Chaveroo oilfield consist of a 50 net working interest, with an average associated 41 revenue interest, in approximately 3,200 gross or 1,600 net acres all held by production, associated with five development blocks with the right to acquire the same working interest in additional development locations and associated acreage at a fixed price. The field is operated by PEDEVCO Corp. PEDEVCO ). Our non-operated interests in the Jonah Field, a natural gas and NGL property in Sublette County, Wyoming, consist of approximately 20 average net working interest and approximately 15 average net revenue interest located on approximately 5,300 gross or 950 net acres all held by production. The properties are operated by Jonah Energy. Our non-operated interests in the Williston Basin, an oil and natural gas producing property, consist of approximately 39 average net working interest and approximately 33 average net revenue interest located on approximately 141,400 gross or 42,200 net acres (approximately 95 held by production) across Billings, Golden Valley, and McKenzie Counties in North Dakota. The properties are operated by Foundation Energy Management.

Table of Contents 
 Our non-operated interests in the Barnett Shale, a natural gas and NGL producing shale reservoir, consist of approximately 17 average net working interest and approximately 14 average net revenue interest (inclusive of small overriding royalty interests). The approximately 123,800 gross or 21,000 net acres are held by production across nine North Texas counties. The oil and natural gas properties are primarily operated by Diversified Energy Company with approximately 10 of wells operated by six other operators. Our non-operated interests in the Hamilton Dome Field, a secondary recovery field utilizing water injection wells to pressurize the reservoir, consist of approximately 24 average net working interest, with an associated 20 average net revenue interest (inclusive of a small overriding royalty interest). The approximately 5,900 gross acre unitized field, of which we hold approximately 1,400 net acres, is operated by Merit Energy Company, who owns the majority of the remaining working interest in the Hamilton Dome Field. The Hamilton Dome Field is located in the southwest region of the Big Horn Basin in northwest Wyoming. Our non-operated interests in the Delhi Field, a CO 2 -EOR project, consist of approximately 24 average net working interest, with an associated 19 revenue interest and separate overriding royalty and mineral interests of approximately 7 yielding a total average net revenue interest of approximately 26 . The field is operated by Denbury Onshore LLC, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The approximately 13,600 gross acre unitized Delhi Field, of which we hold approximately 3,200 net acres, is located in northeast Louisiana in Franklin, Madison, and Richland Parishes. Recent Developments At-the-Market ATM Equity Sales Program On October 21, 2024, we entered into an ATM equity Sales Agreement (the ATM Sales Agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the Lead Agent ), Northland Securities Inc., and A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, up to 30.0 million of shares of common stock through or to the Lead Agent, acting as agent or principal. We have not sold any shares of common stock under the ATM Sales agreement and are not obligated to sell any shares of common stock in the future. We intend to use the net proceeds from any sales of common stock for general corporate purposes, including to redeem or repay outstanding indebtedness. Dividend Declaration On November 11, 2024, Evolution s Board of Directors approved and declared a quarterly dividend of 0.12 per common share payable December 31, 2024. Risks and uncertainties The oil and natural gas industry is a global market impacted by many factors, such as government regulations, particularly in the areas of trade sanctions, taxation, energy, climate change and the environment, geopolitical instability and armed conflicts (including between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East between Israel and Gaza), demand in Asian and European markets, and the extent to which members of OPEC and other oil exporting nations manage oil supply through export quotas. Natural gas prices are generally determined by North American supply and demand and are also affected by imports and exports of liquefied natural gas. Weather also has a significant impact on demand for natural gas since it is a primary heating source. Oil and natural gas prices have been, and we expect may continue to be, volatile. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues, but an extended decline in oil or natural gas prices may affect planned capital expenditures and the oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce. Lower oil and natural gas prices may also reduce the amount of our borrowing base under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, which is determined at the discretion of the lenders based on various factors including the collateral value of our proved reserves, as well as the dividend rate determined by the Board of Directors each quarter. At times, we maintain cash balances in excess of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). We utilize insured cash sweep deposits to maximize the amount of our cash that is protected by FDIC insurance.

 Currently, our oil and natural gas properties are operated by third-party operators and involve other third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence the operation or future development of such properties. Despite these uncertainties, we remain focused on our long-term objectives and continue to be proactive with our third-party operators to review the management of capital expenditures. Given the dynamic nature of these factors and events, we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that certain market conditions will persist. Nor can we predict the broader impact of liquidity concerns around financial institutions; the impact to long-term cost of capital or economic growth as a result of the Federal Reserve s policies; or the impact on the commodity prices that we realize. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had 6.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and 39.5 million outstanding borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility compared to 6.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and 39.5 million borrowings outstanding on our Senior Secured Credit Facility at June 30, 2024. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were cash provided by operations. Our primary uses of liquidity and capital resources for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were our cash dividend payments to our common stockholders and development capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2024, working capital was 8.5 million, an increase of 2.6 million from working capital of 5.9 million as of June 30, 2024. The Senior Secured Credit Facility has a maximum capacity of 50.0 million subject to a borrowing base determined by the lender based on the value of our oil and natural gas properties. The Senior Secured Credit Facility has a current borrowing base of 50.0 million, with 39.5 million drawn as of September 30, 2024. The Senior Secured Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties and matures on April 9, 2026. Borrowings bear interest, at our option, at either the SOFR plus 2.80 or the Prime Rate, as defined under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, plus 1.0 . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest on our borrowings was 8.09 . The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains covenants requiring the maintenance of (i) a total leverage ratio of not more than 3.00 to 1.00, (ii) a current ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00, and (iii) a consolidated tangible net worth of not less than 40.0 million, each as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. It also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a hedging covenant discussed below, and events of default. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Agreement contains hedging requirements that apply when there is 25 or more utilization of the Margined Collateral Value, as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement, to the extent it exceeds the borrowing base then in effect. At each redetermination, our Margined Collateral Value takes into account the estimated value of our oil and natural gas properties, proved developed reserves, total indebtedness, and other relevant factors consistent with customary oil and natural gas lending criteria. On February 12, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility. This amendment required that we enter into hedges for the next 12-month period, and on a rolling 12-month basis thereafter, covering expected crude oil and natural gas production from proved developed reserves, calculated separately, equal to a minimum of 40 of expected crude oil production each month, or 25 each of expected crude oil and natural gas production each month over that period. Thus, we have the option to choose whether to hedge 40 of expected crude oil production or 25 each of expected crude oil and natural gas production. We have historically funded operations through cash from operations and working capital. Our primary source of cash is the sale of produced crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. A portion of these cash flows is used to fund capital expenditures and pay cash dividends to shareholders. We expect to fund near-future capital development activities for our properties with cash flows from operating activities, existing working capital and, as needed, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and any proceeds from ATM Sales Agreement (as described in Recent Developments above). We are pursuing new growth opportunities through acquisitions and other transactions. In addition to cash on hand, we have access to the undrawn portion of the borrowing base available under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, totaling 10.5 million as of September 30, 2024. We also have an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC under which we may issue up to 500.0 million of new debt or equity securities.

 On October 21, 2024, we entered into an ATM Sales Agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC as our Lead Agent, Northland Securities Inc., and A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, up to 30.0 million of shares of common stock through or to the Lead Agent, acting as agent or principal. We have not sold any shares of our common stock under the ATM Sales Agreement and are not obligated to sell any shares of common stock in the future. Our Board of Directors instituted a cash dividend on common stock in December 2013. We have since paid 44 consecutive quarterly dividends. Distribution of a substantial portion of free cash flow in excess of operating and capital requirements through cash dividends remains a priority of our financial strategy, and it is our long-term goal to increase dividends over time, as appropriate. On November 11, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.12 per share of common stock to shareholders of record on December 13, 2024 and payable on December 31, 2024. Capital Expenditures During the three months ending September 30, 2024, we incurred 1.0 million on development capital expenditures. During the first quarter of 2024, capital spending occurred at our fields, including the SCOOP/STACK properties where our operators are actively drilling and have brought seven gross wells online. Based on discussions with our operators, we expect capital workover projects to continue in most of our fields throughout the year. Overall, for fiscal year 2025, we expect budgeted capital expenditures to be in the range of 12.5 million to 14.5 million, which excludes any potential acquisitions. Our expected capital expenditures for fiscal year 2025 include the seven gross wells brought online at our SCOOP/STACK properties, discussed above, bringing an additional eight gross wells online at our SCOOP/STACK properties, the drilling and completion of four new wells at Chaveroo Field, and the drilling and completion of one new well at Delhi Field Test Site V. Full Cost Pool Ceiling Test Under the full cost method of accounting, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depletion, depreciation, and amortization and related deferred taxes, are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at 10 , plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties, as adjusted for related income tax effects (the valuation ceiling ). If capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling, the excess would be charged to expense as a write-down of oil and natural gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurred. The quarterly ceiling test calculation requires that we use the average first day of the month price for our petroleum products during the 12-month period ending with the balance sheet date. The prices used in calculating our ceiling test as of September 30, 2024 were 79.40 per barrel of oil, 2.21 per MMBtu of natural gas and 23.63 per barrel of NGLs. As of September 30, 2024, our capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties were below the full cost valuation ceiling. If commodity price levels were to substantially decline from the 12-month average first day of the month pricing levels as of September 30, 2024 and remain down for a prolonged period of time, our valuation ceiling over our capitalized costs may be reduced and adversely impact our ceiling test results in future quarters. While a 10 reduction in respective commodity prices at September 30, 2024, while all other factors remained constant, would not have generated an impairment, we cannot give assurance that a write-down of capitalized oil and natural gas properties will not be required in the future.

Table of Contents 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 3.3 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily d ue to an increase in revenues. Total revenues increased 1.3 million as compared to the prior year period primarily due increased production volumes partially offset by lower commodity prices. Our average daily production increased 1,021 BOEPD or 15.8 from the prior year period; however our average realized price per barrel of oil equivalent BOE decreased 2.85, or 8.2 from the prior year period. Refer to Results of Operations below for further information. Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.2 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the addition of our SCOOP/STACK properties since the prior year period and the active drilling and completion projects of our operators in the field. Net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately 4.1 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For each of the three months ended, September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid 4.0 million in cash dividends to our common stockholders.

 (1) Equivalent oil reserves are defined as six MCF of natural gas and 42 gallons of NGLs to one barrel of oil conversion ratio which reflects energy equivalence and not price equivalence. Natural gas prices per MCF and NGL prices per barrel often differ significantly from the equivalent amount of oil. (2) Amounts exclude the impact of cash paid or received on the settlement of derivative contracts since we did not elect to apply hedge accounting.

Table of Contents 
 Revenues Crude oil, natural gas and NGL revenues were 21.9 million and 20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in revenues is primarily due to an increase in production volumes partially offset by the decrease in our average realized price per BOE. Average daily equivalent production increased 15.8 from 6,457 BOEPD in the prior year period to 7,478 BOEPD in the current period as a result of t he acquisitions of non-operated working interests in the SCOOP/STACK properties in February 2024 and first production at our wells in the Chaveroo Field in early February 2024, which collectively increased production for the three months ended September 30, 2024 by approximately 1,600 BOEPD. The overall increase in production is partially offset by natural production declines in our other fields combined with reduced oil recovery at Delhi Field as the field experienced reduced CO 2 injected volumes during the quarter. Similar to last quarter, downtime from one of the CO 2 recycle compressors at Delhi Field reduced CO 2 injection volumes for part of the current quarter. The compressor was replaced, and full CO 2 recycling resumed in mid-July 2024. The CO 2 purchase pipeline was taken offline for preventative maintenance at the end of February 2024 and has remained down since then. The operator anticipates resuming CO 2 purchases in October 2025. Our average realized commodity price (excluding the impact of derivative contracts) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 2.85 per BOE, or 8.2 , over the prior year period. The amount we realize for our production depends predominantly upon commodity prices, which are affected by changes in market demand and supply, as impacted by overall economic activity, weather, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. Realized natural gas prices decreased 29.9 from the year-ago quarter, which was the largest portion of the driver of the decrease in revenues. Lease Operating Costs Ad valorem and production taxes were 1.4 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On a per unit basis, ad valorem and production taxes were 2.06 per BOE and 2.15 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in ad valorem and production taxes on a per BOE basis is primarily due to decreases in oil and natural gas prices since the year-ago quarter . Gathering, transportation and other costs were 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Costs include gathering, transportation and processing fees we incur primarily for our natural gas producing properties. The increase is primarily due to t he acquisitions of non-operated working interests in the SCOOP/STACK plays in February 2024 which added 0.5 million in g athering transportation and other costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024. On a per unit basis, gathering transportation and other costs were 3.89 per BOE and 3.09 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other lease operating costs decreased 1.1 million, or 12.2 , compared to the year-ago quarter primarily due to decreased CO 2 purchases at Delhi. We did not purchase any CO 2 at Delhi for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to purchases of 1.6 million in the year-ago quarter . On a per unit basis, other lease operating costs decreased to 11.19 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.77 per BOE in the year-ago quarter. Depletion of Full Cost Proved Oil and Natural Gas Properties Depletion expense increased 1.4 million or 36.2 from 3.9 million to 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in the depletion rate. On a per unit basis, depletion expense was 7.74 per BOE and 6.58 per BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The depletion rate of our unit of production calculation increased due to an increase in our depletable base due to our SCOOP/STACK Acquisitions and capital expenditures since the year-ago quarter . General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2.0 million and 2.1 million, respectively. On a per unit basis, general and administrative expenses were 2.86 per BOE and 3.59 per

 BOE for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease primarily relates to lower transaction and consulting fees. Stock-based Compensation Expense Stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.1 million to 0.6 million compared to 0.5 million for the year-ago quarter . The increase is associated with new awards granted since the year-ago quarter. Net Gain (Loss) on Derivative Contracts Periodically, we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. We have elected not to designate our open derivative contracts for hedge accounting, and accordingly, we recorded the net change in the mark-to-market valuation of the derivative contracts in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The amounts recorded on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations related to derivative contracts represent the (i) gains (losses) related to fair value adjustments on our open, or unrealized, derivative contracts, and (ii) gains (losses) on settlements of derivative contracts for positions that have settled or been realized. The table below summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative contracts as well as the impact of net realized gains (losses) on our average realized prices for the periods presented. As a result of our SCOOP/STACK Acquisitions in February 2024 and the corresponding borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility, we were required by terms in our Senior Secured Credit Facility to hedge a portion of our production. The decrease in forward commodity prices as of September 30, 2024, resulted in an unrealized gain on the mark-to-market of our hedges. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.5 million derivative assets, 1.3 million of which was classified as current, and 0.5 million derivative liabilities, 0.2 million of which was classified as current.

In addition, the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings was 8.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized income tax expense of 0.8 million on net income before income taxes of 2.9 million compared to income tax expense of 0.5 million on net income before income taxes of 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rates were 28.4 and 23.9 for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate increased compared to the year-ago quarter as projected state income taxes have become a larger component of our overall income tax expense during the current quarter. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires that we select certain accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These policies, together with our estimates, have a significant effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity We are exposed to various risks, including energy commodity price risk, such as price differentials between the NYMEX commodity price and the index price at the location where our production is sold. When oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices decline significantly, our ability to finance our capital budget and operations may be adversely impacted. We expect energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable, therefore we monitor commodity prices to identify the potential need for the use of derivative financial instruments to provide partial protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes. In accordance with our Senior Secured Credit Facility, we may be required to enter into hedges if we meet certain utilization levels of the borrowing base under the credit facility. We intend to remain in compliance with these covenants and will enter into derivative contracts from time to time to meet the requirements. Additionally, depending on market conditions, financial and other considerations we may enter into additional hedges to meet our objectives of increasing value to shareholders. We are exposed to market risk on our open derivative contracts related to potential non-performance by our counterparties. It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy institutions deemed by management as competitive market makers. For the derivative contracts settled during fiscal 2024 and 2023, we did not post collateral. We account for our derivative activities under the provisions of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , ASC 815 ). ASC 815 establishes accounting and reporting that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. See Note 7, Derivatives to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more details. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, any borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at either SOFR plus 2.80 , subject to a minimum SOFR of 0.50 , or the Prime Rate, as defined under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, plus 1.00 . SOFR rates are sensitive to the period of contract and market volatility, as well as changes in forward interest rate yields. Under our current practices, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC rules and forms. This information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(c) and 15(d)-15(e)) as of the end of the quarter covered by this report. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives. Based on the foregoing, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we have determined that there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Part II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for a description of any legal proceedings, which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 1A.

 (1) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, all of the shares received were surrendered by employees in exchange for the payment of tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock awards. (2) On September 8, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 25.0 million of its common stock in the open market through December 31, 2024. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will depend on a variety of factors, including management s assessment of the intrinsic value of the Company s shares, the market price of the Company's common stock, the Company s capital needs and resources, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal requirements. The value of shares authorized for repurchase by the Company's Board of Directors does not require the Company to repurchase such shares or guarantee that such shares will be repurchased, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
