In December 2022, the Company instructed the Trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in an interest bearing cash account. In September 2023, the Company further instructed the Trustee to move the funds held in the Trust Account to an interest bearing bank deposit program until the earlier of the consummation of a business combination or the liquidation of the Company. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay franchise taxes, the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private Warrants will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of the Company s public shares if the Company does not complete an initial Business Combination within from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of the Company s public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of its public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within from the closing of the IPO or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company s public stockholders. The Company will provide its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, in its sole discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations.

In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company seeks stockholder approval, and a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. On September 5, 2024, the Company has extended the time to complete the initial Business Combination to December 31, 2024 as described below (the Combination Period ). However, if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable and up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. The Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and public shares they hold in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, and (iv) vote any Founder Shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of the initial Business Combination.

However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and the Company believes that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company with Working Capital Loans (see Note 5). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were Working Capital Loans outstanding. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern , management has determined that the Company has and will continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete its initial Business Combination or because the Company becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of public shares upon consummation of the initial Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, the Company would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of its initial Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete its initial Business Combination because it does not have sufficient funds available to it, the Company will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following the initial Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, the Company may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet its obligations. Management has determined that if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by December 31, 2024, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution as well as the Company s working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after the Combination Period. The Business Combination Agreement provides that if the transaction is not closed by December 31, 2024, either party can terminate the Business Combination Agreement.

Under the guidance in ASC 815-40, the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment. As such, the warrants must be recorded on the condensed balance sheets at fair value.

With each re-measurement, the warrant valuation will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s condensed statements of operations. All of the Company s permitted investments are held in a money market fund. Fair values of these investments are determined by Level 1 inputs utilizing quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets. The Company s warrant liability for the Private Placement Warrants is based on a valuation model utilizing management judgment and pricing inputs from observable and unobservable markets with less volume and transaction frequency than active markets. Significant deviations from these estimates and inputs could result in a material change in fair value. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrant liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Warrant Purchase Agreements, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 5,013,333 Warrants (each a Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor and Cantor Fitzgerald Co. at a purchase price of 1.50 per Private Placement Warrant. The sale of the Private Placement Warrants generated gross proceeds to the Company of 7,520,000. After the special stockholders meeting held on December 20, 2022, to vote upon a charter amendment to extend the time to complete a business combination until June 9, 2023 (subject to an additional three month extension at the discretion of the Board), stockholders holding 26,186,896 Public Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares (and did not withdraw their redemption) for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.08 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of 263,963,913. Following such redemptions, 1,413,104 Public Shares remained outstanding in the trust. On April 26, 2023, Dr. Borade, an Audit Committee member, notified us of his intent to resign as a member of our Board effective April 26, 2023. Dr. Borade s decision to resign was not the result of any dispute or disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operation, policies (including accounting or financial policies) or practices.

Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities for the period from November 5, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the IPO, and identifying a target company for our initial Business Combination. We generate non-operating interest income form cash and cash equivalents marketable securities held in the Trust Account and changes in the value of warrant liabilities. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing), as well as for due diligence expenses. We will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of 642,900, which consisted of 1,019,694 of formation and offering cost and provision for income taxes of 5,163, which are offset by a 348,971 gain on the change in fair value of warrants and interest income on investments held in the Trust Account of 32,986.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources We consummated our IPO on March 9, 2021. As of September 30, 2024, we had 358,181 in our operating bank account, which includes 32,580 of restricted cash to be used for tax payments only, and negative working capital of approximately 7,141,435. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide us Working Capital Loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no Working Capital Loans outstanding. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 2,320,967, which was due to our net loss of 2,035,985, unrealized gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 248,882, interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 113,590, and unrealized gain on change in fair value of derivative liability of 2,202, which were offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of 78,353 and the accretion of discount on related party loans of 1,339. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 1,462,079, which was due to our net loss of 739,623, unrealized gain on fair value of warranty liability of 442,726, forgiveness of unrelated vendor payables of 275,000, and interest earned on cash and Investments held in the Trust Account of 506,550, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of 501,820. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was cash provided by investing activities of 2,025,592, which was the result of proceeds from the Trust Account used for tax redemptions and payments in the amount of 1,802,869 and 354,519, which was offset by the advances to the Trust Account of 131,796. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was cash provided by investing activities of 11,432,625, which was the result of cash proceeds from the Trust Account for tax payments and redemption adjustments of 11,510,446, offset by advances to the Trust Account of 77,821. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 497,131, which was a result of the proceeds from Liminatus promissory note of 2,300,000, offset by the redemption of Class A common stock of 1,802,869. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 9,913,465, which was a result of Class A Common Stock that was redeemed in December 2022 and September 2023 for 10,657,185, which was offset by proceeds from the promissory note from a related party for 393,720 and the proceeds from the promissory note from Liminatus for 350,000. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the Company has and will continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our initial Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our initial Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. Management has determined that if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by December 31, 2024 (the Combination Period ), then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution as well as the Company s working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after the Combination Period. Critical Accounting Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses and related disclosures. 

 26 

Table of Contents 
 We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions, judgements and the related policies that we believe have the most significant impact on its financial statements are described below: Fair Value of Warrants In determining the fair value of our Private Placement Warrants, our Board used the most observable inputs available. The valuation approach utilized the Monte Carlo simulation model. Some of the inputs used in the model include the expected common stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected Business Combination date and probability of completing the Business Combination. Several of these inputs are known and several use judgement. For instance, the probability of completing the Business Combination is derived by taking a sample of other special purpose acquisition companies and calculating the implied probability of completion for each company in the sample set. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions, or the relationships between these assumptions, impact our valuation of our Private Placement Warrants as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of these warrants. Recent Accounting Standards Our management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this quarterly report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Specifically, management s determination was based on the following material weaknesses which existed as of September 30, 2024, related to: (1) the difficulty we experienced in our accounting for complex financial instruments, (2) the lack of controls needed to assure that we are maintaining compliance with income tax regulations, including the timely filing of complete and accurate income tax returns, (3) the lack of controls needed to assure the preparation of complete and accurate financial statement disclosures, and (4) controls over income tax accounting, including those needed to identify, reconcile and properly account for difference between our book income tax provision and tax returns are ineffective. The Company has begun to develop a remediation which is more fully described below. After identifying the material weaknesses, we have commenced our remediation efforts by taking the following steps: We have expanded and improved our review process for complex securities and related accounting standards. We have increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. We are establishing additional monitoring and oversight controls designed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements and related disclosures. 

 27 

Table of Contents 
 We plan to hire consultants to prepare and complete the filing of our tax returns. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim condensed financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Notwithstanding the determination that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, as of September 30, 2024 based on the material weaknesses described above, we believe that our condensed financial statements contained in this quarterly report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the years covered hereby in all material respects. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
