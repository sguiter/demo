Because the Company currently does not intend to sell those available-for-sale securities that have an unrealized loss at September 30, 2024, and it is not likely that they we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company has determined that no write-down is necessary. In addition, the Company evaluates whether any portion of the decline in fair value of available-for-sale securities is the result of credit deterioration, which would require the recognition of an allowance for credit losses. The unrealized losses associated with available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2024, are driven by changes in interest rates and are not due to the credit quality of the securities, and accordingly, no allowance for credit losses is considered necessary related to available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2024. Management evaluates the financial performance of the issuers on a quarterly basis to determine if it is probable that the issuers can make all contractual principal and interest payments. The unrealized losses in the Company s held-to-maturity portfolio were caused by changes in the interest rate environment. The Company has a zero-loss expectation for its U.S. Treasury securities in addition to U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and mortgage-backed securities (GSEs), and accordingly, no allowance for credit losses is estimated for these securities. The held-to-maturity state and municipal securities are general obligation bonds, which have a very low historical default rate due to issuers generally having unlimited taxing authority to service the debt. All debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, continue to perform as scheduled and we do not believe an allowance for credit losses is necessary. The Company utilizes bond credit ratings assigned by third party ratings agencies to monitor the credit quality of debt securities held-to-maturity. At September 30, 2024, all debt securities classified as held-to-maturity were rated AA- or higher by the ratings agencies. Updated credit ratings are obtained as they become available from the ratings agencies. Allowance for Credit Losses ACL There were no past due or nonaccrual AFS or HTM securities at September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses and based on the analysis of the underlying risk

 provision for credit losses related to AFS or HTM securities recorded during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, because the ACL was deemed immaterial. Other Investments: Our other investments consist of restricted non-marketable equity securities that have no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that there was impairment on its other investment securities. Federal Home Loan Bank stock First National Bankers Bank stock Total Consumer real estate Construction and land development Commercial and industrial Leases Consumer and other Total loans and leases Less: Allowance for credit losses ) ) Loans and leases, net The loan and lease portfolio is disaggregated into segments. There are loan and lease portfolio segments which include commercial real estate, consumer real estate, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, leases, and consumer and other. The following describe risk characteristics relevant to each of the portfolio segments: Commercial Real Estate: Commercial real estate loans include owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and loans secured by income-producing properties. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans to operating businesses are long-term financing of land and buildings. These loans are repaid by cash flow generated from the business operation. Real estate loans for income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers are repaid from rent income derived from the properties. Loans within this portfolio segment are particularly sensitive to the valuation of real estate.

(2) In the provision expense in the consolidated statements of income was a release of thousand and thousand of unfunded commitments through the provision for credit losses not reflected in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. We maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level that we deem appropriate to adequately cover the expected credit loss in the loan and lease portfolio. Our provision for credit losses on loan and lease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, is million and million, respectively, and million and million, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, our allowance for credit losses was million and million, respectively, which we deemed to be adequate at each of the respective dates. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans and leases was at September 30, 2024, and at December 31, 2023. A description of the general characteristics of the risk grades used by the Company is as follows: Pass: Loans and leases in this risk category involve borrowers of acceptable-to-strong credit quality and risk who have the apparent ability to satisfy their loan and lease obligations. Loans and leases in this risk grade would possess sufficient mitigating factors, such as adequate collateral or strong guarantors possessing the capacity to repay the debt if required, for any weakness that may exist. Watch: Loans and leases in this risk category involve borrowers that exhibit characteristics, or are operating under conditions that, if not successfully mitigated as planned, have a reasonable risk of resulting in a downgrade within the next six to twelve months. Loans and leases may remain in this risk category for six months and then are either upgraded or downgraded upon subsequent evaluation. Special Mention: Loans and leases in this risk grade are the equivalent of the regulatory definition of Other Assets Especially Mentioned classification. Loans and leases in this category possess some credit deficiency or potential weakness, which requires a high level of management attention. Potential weaknesses include declining trends in operating earnings and cash flows and /or reliance on the secondary source of repayment. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in noticeable deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Company s credit position. Substandard: Loans and leases in this risk grade are inadequately protected by the borrower s current financial condition and payment capability or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans and leases so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the orderly repayment of debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful: Loans and leases in this risk grade have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or orderly repayment in full, on the basis of current existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing commercial properties. Standby letters of credit issued by the Company are conditional commitments to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. Collateral held varies and is required in instances which the Company deems necessary. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of liabilities related to the Company s obligation to perform under standby letters of credit was insignificant. The Company is subject in the normal course of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation pending or threatened against the Company will be material to the Company s consolidated financial position. On an on-going basis, the Company assesses any potential liabilities or contingencies in connection with such legal proceedings. For those matters where it is deemed probable that the Company will incur losses and the amount of the losses can be reasonably estimated, the Company would record an expense and corresponding liability in its consolidated financial statements.

Collateral-dependent loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Collateral may be real estate and/or business assets including equipment, inventory, and/or accounts receivable. The Company determines the value of the collateral based on independent appraisals performed by qualified licensed appraisers. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Appraised values are discounted for costs to sell and may be discounted further based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the date of the most recent appraisal, and/or management s expertise and knowledge of the customer and the customer s business. Such discounts by management are subjective and are typically significant unobservable inputs for determining fair value. Collateral-dependent loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly, based on the same factors discussed above. The amount of valuation allowance on all collateral-dependent loans was million and million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Other real estate owned: Other real estate owned, consisting of properties obtained through foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans, are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell upon transfer of the loans to other real estate. Subsequently, other real estate is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Fair values are generally based on third-party appraisals of the property and are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The

Through this program, the Company originates a variable rate loan with the customer. The Company and the customer will then enter into a fixed interest rate swap. Lastly, an identical offsetting swap is entered into by the Company with a dealer bank. These back-to-back swap arrangements are intended to offset each other and allow the Company to book a variable rate loan, while providing the customer with a contract for fixed interest payments. In these arrangements, the Company s net cash flow is equal to the interest income received from the variable rate loan originated with the customer. These customer swaps are not designated as hedging instruments and are recorded at fair value in other assets and other liabilities. Since the income statement impact of the offsetting positions is limited, any changes in fair value are recognized as other noninterest income in the current period.

If, at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. Regarding the discount rate, Topic 842 requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease whenever this rate is readily determinable. As this rate is rarely determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term.

Critical Accounting Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. The most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in Note 1 to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These factors include among other things, whether the policy requires management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The accounting policies which we believe to be most critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in the section titled Critical Accounting Policies in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no other significant changes in the Company s application of critical accounting policies since December 31, 2023.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the comparable period in 2023, the increase in net income of 7.1 million was due to an increase in noninterest income of 8.4 million and net interest income after provision for loan and lease losses of 2.2 million, offset by an increase in noninterest expense of 2.3 million and income tax expense of 1.3 million. The increase in noninterest income was associated with a 6.8 million pre-tax loss on the sale of available-for-sale securities, as a result of a balance sheet optimization transaction in September 2023. The tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.11 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.81 for the third quarter of 2023. Noninterest income to average assets was 0.74 for the third quarter of 2024, increasing from 0.06 for the third quarter of 2023. Noninterest expense to average assets increased to 2.50 in the third quarter of 2024, from 2.37 in the third quarter of 2023. First nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 Net income totaled 26.5 million, or 1.57 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended 2024, compared to 22.4 million, or 1.33 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended 2023. The increase in net income of 4.1 million for this period was primarily from the increase of 10.4 million in noninterest income, offset by an increase of 5.1 million in noninterest expense and 579 thousand in income tax expense. The increase in noninterest income was associated with a 6.8 million pre-tax loss on the sale of available-for-sale securities, as a result of a balance sheet optimization transaction in September 2023. The tax equivalent net interest margin was 2.97 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 3.01 for the first nine months of 2023. Noninterest income to average assets was 0.69 for the first nine months of 2024,

 increasing from 0.41 for the first nine months of 2023. Noninterest expense to average assets increased to 2.42 in the first nine months of 2024, from 2.35 in the first nine months of 2023. Net Interest Income and Yield Analysis Third quarter of 2024 compared to 2023 Net interest income, taxable equivalent, increased to 35.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, up from 31.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income was positively impacted by the increase in balances of loans and leases and the increase in yield/rate on these interest-earning assets, offset by the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Average interest-earning assets increased from 4.40 billion for the third quarter of 2023, to 4.53 billion for the third quarter of 2024, primarily from the increase in our average loan and lease balances and average cash balances, which was offset by decreases in average securities. Over this period, average loan and lease balances increased by 274.1 million, average federal funds sold and other interest-earning assets increased by 37.8 million, average interest-bearing deposits increased by 129.3 million, and average borrowing increased by 37.4 million. Average securities decreased by 179.2 million and noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by 66.2 million. The tax equivalent net interest margin increased to 3.11 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.81 for the third quarter of 2023. The yield on earning assets increased from 4.99 for the third quarter of 2023, to 5.65 for the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to the deployment of excess cash and cash equivalents into loans and leases and the increase in rates by the Federal Reserve. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits increased from 2.84 for the third quarter of 2023, to 3.20 for the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to the increase in rates by the Federal Reserve and increased pricing competition.

Net interest income was positively impacted, compared to the prior year, primarily by the increase in balances of loans and leases and the increase in yield/rate on interest-earning assets, offset by the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Average interest-earning assets increased from 4.39 billion for the first nine months of 2023 to 4.51 billion for the first nine months of 2024, primarily because of the Company s continued organic loan and lease growth and the increase in our average cash balances, offset by a decrease in our securities.

 Deposits Deposits are the primary source of funds for the Company s lending and investing activities. The Company provides a range of deposit services to businesses and individuals, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, IRAs and CDs. These accounts generally earn interest at rates the Company establishes based on market factors and the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs. The establishment or continuity of a core deposit relationship can be a factor in loan pricing decisions. While the Company s primary focus is on establishing customer relationships to attract core deposits, at times, the Company uses brokered deposits and other wholesale deposits to supplement its funding sources. As of September 30, 2024, brokered deposits represented approximately 4.55 of total deposits. The following tables summarize the average balances outstanding and average interest rates for each major category of deposits for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively dollars in thousands) : 

Three Months Ended Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Average of Average Average of Average Balance Total Rate Balance Total Rate Noninterest-bearing demand 884,938 20.6 951,179 22.5 Interest-bearing demand 925,307 21.6 2.27 969,122 22.9 2.24 Money market and savings 1,917,301 44.7 3.45 1,753,671 41.5 3.11 Time deposits 560,699 13.1 3.87 551,191 13.0 3.04 Total average deposits 4,288,245 100.0 2.54 4,225,163 100.0 2.20

 The Company believes its deposit product offerings are properly structured to attract and retain core deposit relationships. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, was 3.20 and 2.84 , respectively. The cost increase was primarily attributable to the rate increases. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, was 3.19 and 2.45 , respectively. The cost increase was primarily attributable to the increases in rates and increased pricing competition. Total deposits as of September 30, 2024, were 4.32 billion, which was an increase of 54.6 million from December 31, 2023. This overall increase was driven primarily by the issuance of brokered deposits of 174.8 million, increase in other time deposits of 44.3 million and savings deposits of 42.4 million, offset by a decline in interest-bearing demand deposits of 172.7 million and noninterest bearing deposits of 34 million. During the quarter, the Bank elected not to pursue a higher cost public funds depository relationship and utilized Federal Home Loan Advances temporarily, which was replaced with brokered deposits. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding time deposits under 250,000 with balances of 516.9 million and time deposits over 250,000 with balances of 252.7 million. The following table summarizes the maturities of time deposits 250,000 or more (in thousands) . 

September 30, 2024 Three months or less 58,243 Three to six months 71,861 Six to twelve months 91,887 More than twelve months 30,676 Total 252,667 The Company's estimated uninsured deposits totaled 1.86 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.76 billion at December 31, 2023, representing 43.0 and 41.3 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. These estimates were derived using the same methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting. Borrowings The Company uses short-term borrowings and long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital using debt at the Company level which can be down-streamed as Tier 1 capital to the Bank. Borrowings totaled 9.0 million at September 30, 2024, and consisted of short-term borrowings of 5.0 million, and 4.0 million of securities sold under repurchase agreements. Long-term debt totaled 39.7 million and 42.1 million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, and consisted entirely of subordinated debt. For more information regarding our borrowings, see Part I - Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6 Borrowings, Line of Credit and Subordinated Debt of this report. Capital Resources The Company uses leverage analysis to examine the potential of the institution to increase assets and liabilities using the current capital base. The key measurements included in this analysis are the Bank s Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, leverage and total capital ratios. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our capital ratios, including our Bank s capital ratios, exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements. From time to time, we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank subsidiary. We believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our bank, if necessary. For more information regarding our capital, leverage and total capital ratios, see Part I - Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12 Regulatory Matters of this report. Liquidity and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing and depository needs of its customers. At September 30, 2024, we had 780.6 million of pre-approved but unused lines of credit and 29.3 million of standby letters of credit. These commitments generally have fixed expiration

Table of Contents 
 dates, and many will expire without being drawn upon. The total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed to fund these outstanding commitments, the Bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale, or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions. For more information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Part I - Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Note 8 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of this report. Market Risk and Liquidity Risk Management The Bank s Asset Liability Management Committee ALCO oversees market risk management and establishes risk measures, limits on policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. A variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive overview of the Company s magnitude of interest rate risk, the distribution of risk, the level of risk over time and the exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships. We utilize an independent third-party earnings simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates. The model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over the next 12-24 months. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a flat-rate case scenario of hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates over the next 12-24 months. These simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix, pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet. The impact of interest rate, caps and floors, is also included in the model. Other interest rate-related risks such as prepayment, basis and option risk are also considered. In addition, third parties will join the meetings of ALCO to provide feedback regarding future balance sheet structure, earnings and liquidity strategies. ALCO continuously monitors and manages the balance between interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. The objective is to manage the impact of fluctuating market rates on net interest income within acceptable levels. In order to meet this objective, management may lengthen or shorten the duration of assets or liabilities. Interest Rate Sensitivity Interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates. ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and leases and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. The primary measurements we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity are an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity model. These measurements are used in conjunction with competitive pricing analysis and are further described below. Earnings Simulation Model We believe interest rate risk is effectively measured by our earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with simulated forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months. To limit interest rate risk, we have guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in instantaneous changes to interest rates. We also periodically monitor simulations based on various rate scenarios such as non-parallel shifts in market interest rates over time. For changes up or down in rates from our static interest rate forecast over the next 12 months, limits in the decline in net interest income are as follows: 

Estimated Change in Net Interest Income Over 12 Months September 30, 2024: Instantaneous, Parallel Change in Prevailing Interest Rates Equal to: 100 basis points increase (1.43) 200 basis points increase (2.81) 100 basis points decrease 0.80 200 basis points decrease 1.21 Economic Value of Equity Our economic value of equity model measures the extent that estimated economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case economic value of equity. 

 54 

Table of Contents 
 To help monitor our related risk, we ve established the following policy limits regarding simulated changes in our economic value of equity: 

Current Estimated Instantaneous Rate Change September 30, 2024: Instantaneous, Parallel Change in Prevailing Interest Rates Equal to: 100 basis points increase (4.97) 200 basis points increase (10.00) 100 basis points decrease 5.32 200 basis points decrease 8.72 At September 30, 2024, our model results indicated that we were within our policy limits. Liquidity Risk Management The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan and lease demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions. Changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates and intend to continue this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position. Scheduled loan and lease payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan and lease payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt securities are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis. The Company has 1.5 million in securities that mature throughout the next 12 months. The Company also has unused borrowing capacity in the amount of 917.7 million available with the Federal Reserve, Federal Home Loan Bank, several correspondent banks and a line of credit. With these sources of funds, the Company currently anticipates adequate liquidity to meet the expected obligations of its customers.
