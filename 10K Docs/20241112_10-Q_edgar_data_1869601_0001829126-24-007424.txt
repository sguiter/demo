Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on August 12, 2022, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Units was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account and may be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s shareholders, as described below. 

The Company will provide its shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The Company will proceed with a business combination only if the Company have net tangible assets of at least immediately prior to or upon such consummation and, solely if a vote is held to approve a business combination, an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. 

The shareholders will be entitled to redeem their
Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially 
 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company
to pay its tax obligations). The per- share amount to be distributed to shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced

of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. These ordinary shares were recorded at a redemption value and
classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. 

If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Memorandum and Articles of Association, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 

The Sponsor has agreed (a) to vote its founder shares, the ordinary shares included in the Private Units (the Private Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company s Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Company s pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Ordinary shares) and Private Units (including underlying securities) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of Association relating to shareholders rights of pre-Business Combination activity and (d) that the Ordinary shares and Private Units (including underlying securities) shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsor will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination.

Association in its entirety and substitute it with the second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association of
the Company (the Amended Articles of Association (b) as an ordinary resolution, an amendment to the investment
management trust agreement dated as of August 9, 2022 (the Trust Agreement between the Company and Continental

August 12, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Agreement the Initial Extension Payment (the First Trust Agreement Amendment
Proposal and (c) as a special resolution, an amendment to the Articles of Association to remove the net tangible asset
requirement from the Articles of Association in order to expand the methods that the Company may employ so as not to become subject
to the penny stock rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission by deleting the Articles of Association in its
entirety and substitute it with the second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association of the Company (the
 NTA Requirement Amendment Proposal ). In connection with the shareholders vote at the First Extraordinary
General Meeting, 
ordinary shares were tendered for redemption. On August 14, 2023, the Company accepted a reversal request for 
shares. As a result, a total of 
ordinary shares were redeemed at a redemption price of approximately 
per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of ,
leaving 
ordinary shares subject to possible redemption still outstanding after the August 2023 redemption. 

In connection with the shareholders vote at the annual general meeting Annual General Meeting of shareholders held by the Company on October 20, 2023, ordinary shares were tendered for redemption, leaving ordinary shares subject to possible redemption still outstanding. 

On August 12,
2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the Second Extraordinary General Meeting ), at
which, the Company and its Trustee signed an amendment to the investment management Trust Agreement, to give the Company the right
to extend the Combination Period twelve (12) times for an additional one (1) month each time, from August 12, 2024 to August 12,
2025 (the Extended Date ), by depositing into the Trust Account per outstanding public share for each one-month
extension (the Amended Extension Payment ), as approved by the Company s shareholders in accordance with the
Company s Amended Articles of Association. At the Second Extraordinary General Meeting, the shareholders of the Company
approved a special resolution to the Amended Articles of Association to extend the Combination Period from the Termination Date to
the Extended Date and to delete words (less up to US of interest to pay dissolution expenses) . 

In connection with the shareholders vote
at the Second Extraordinary General Meeting held by the Company on August 12, 2024, ordinary shares were tendered for redemption,
leaving ordinary shares outstanding. 

On September 10, 2024, the Company deposited 
into the Trust Account, extending the Termination Date to September 12, 2024. The Company has the right to extend the Combination Period
eleven (11) more times for an additional one (1) month each time, from September 12, 2024 to August 12, 2025. 

If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination
within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably
possible but no more than five business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable
in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (net of taxes payable, if any),
divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights
as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly
as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s board
of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its
obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. The underwriter has agreed to waive its rights
to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within
the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available
to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets
remaining available for distribution will be less than the IPO price per Unit 10.00). 

The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below 10.25 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the company s independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had of cash in its operating bank account. 

The Company s liquidity needs prior to the
consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through the payment of 
from the Sponsor to cover for certain offering costs on the Company s behalf in exchange for issuance of Founder Shares (as
defined in Note 5), and loan from the Sponsor of 
under the promissory note, which has been terminated upon closing of the Initial Public Offering. Subsequent to the consummation
of the Initial Public Offering, the Company s liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of
the Initial Public Offering, the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account, the Convertible Promissory Notes (as
defined and described in Note 5), the amount due to third party which is defined and described in Note 6 and the promissory note - third party which is defined and described in Note 7. As of September 30, 2024, there was 
outstanding under the Convertible Promissory Notes, which was issued to the Company s related party for extension and working capital purposes, due to third party for extension purposes, and outstanding under the promissory note - third party. 

Going Concern Consideration 

The Company expects to incur significant costs
in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations
in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an
Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that if the Company is unsuccessful in
consummating an Initial Business Combination by August 12, 2025 (subject to the Amended Extension Payment is made as required
for each monthly extension), the requirement that the Company cease all operations, redeem the Public Shares and thereafter
liquidate and dissolve raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The balance sheet
does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying financial statement has
been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ),
which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.

In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

ordinary shares sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the
redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer
in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated
certificate of incorporation. In accordance with ASC 480, conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that
feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain
events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve
the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. In
connection with the shareholders vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting on August 9, 2023, 
ordinary shares were tendered for redemption. On August 14, 2023, the Company accepted a reversal request for 
shares. As a result, a total of 
ordinary shares were redeemed, leaving ordinary shares subject to possible redemption after the August 7, 2023 redemption. In
connection with the Annual General Meeting held on October 20, 2023, 
ordinary shares were tendered for redemption, leaving 
ordinary shares subject to possible redemption still outstanding. In connection with the shareholders vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders held by the Company on August 12, 2024, ordinary shares were redeemed, leaving ordinary shares subject to possible redemption after the August 12, 2024 redemption. 

Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, 
and ordinary shares, respectively, subject to possible redemption at the redemption amount were presented at redemption
value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders deficit section of the Company s balance sheets.

regain compliance or being afforded an applicable cure or compliance period.

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for our IPO and after our IPO, searching for a business combination target. Following our IPO, we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our Business Combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents after our IPO. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. We expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with completing a business combination. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 227,631 which consists of investment income earned on investments
held in trust account of 581,984 partially offset by operating costs of 350,840 and interest expense of 3,513. For the three months
ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 454,799, which consists of investment income earned on investments held in trust account
of 942,835, partially offset by operating costs of 488,036. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we had a net income of 1,212,138 which consists of investment income earned on investments held in trust account of 2,072,719 partially
offset by operating costs of 478,567 and loss on modification of deferred underwriter commission of 378,501 and interest expense of
 3,513. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 1,969,273 which consists of Investment income earned on
investments held in trust account of 2,706,368 and operating costs of 737,095. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

On August 12, 2022, the Company consummated its initial public offering of 7,392,855 units (the Units , and, with respect to the ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ), including the issuance of 892,855 Units as a result of the partial exercise by EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC (the Representative of its over-allotment option (the Over-Allotment Option ), at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 73,928,550 (the Initial Public Offering ). 

Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement Private Placement with the Sponsor of 373,750 units (the Private Units ), generating total proceeds of 3,737,500. 

Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on August 12, 2022, an amount of 75,776,764 10.25 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Units was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account ). 

Transaction costs of the Initial Public Offering
with the exercise of the over-allotment amounted to 3,898,030 consisting of 739,286 of up-front underwriting fees and a deferred discount
of 2,587,499 and 571,245 of other costs. As of closing, 760,003 of the proceeds from the IPO was held outside of the Trust Account
and is available for working capital purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company charged 210,873 in offering cost
to accumulated deficit. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 13,053
on our balance sheet and a working capital deficit of 2,783,677. We intend to use the funds held outside of the Trust Account and proceeds
from Convertible Promissory Notes (as described below) for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing business
due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses,
reviewing corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, selecting the target business to acquire and structuring,
negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. The interest income earned on the investments in the Trust Account are unavailable
to fund operating expenses. 

In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business
Combination, the Company s Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company s officers and directors may, but are not
obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced
by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s
discretion, up to 500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into additional Private Units at a price
of 10.00 per Unit. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the
Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital
Loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company borrowed 241,112 and 90,112, respectively, which was included in convertible promissory note - related party. 

22 

On September 8, 2023, the Company borrowed 10,000 from the Sponsor. The loan bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the consummation of the Company s Business Combination. It is convertible at the Sponsor s election upon the consummation of the Company s Business Combination. Upon such election, this loan will convert, at a price of 10.00 per unit, into units identical to the private placement units issued in connection with the Company s initial public offering. 

From October 2023 to the filing of this Quarterly
Report, the Company borrowed 841,112 in total from our Chief Financial Officer, in form of convertible promissory notes, for working
capital and extension deposits purposes (as described in Note 5 of the Notes to the Financial Statements). These loans bear no interest
and are repayable in full upon the consummation of the Company s Business Combination. They are convertible at the CFO s election
upon the consummation of the Company s Business Combination. Upon such election, these loans will convert, at a price of 10.00
per unit, into units identical to the private placement units issued in connection with the Company s initial public offering. 

From October 2023 to the filing of this Quarterly
Report, the Company s CFO also paid 144,060, on behalf of us, to the third-party vendors for working capital purposes. These amounts
are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. 

From July 2024 to September 2024, the Company
borrowed 600,000 from an unrelated third party, which the Company entered into a letter of intent with for a potential business
combination. These amounts are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. The Company recorded them as due to third party on
the unaudited condensed balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, the total due to third party was 600,000. 

On August 5, 2024, the Company borrowed 300,000
from another unrelated third party, by issuing a promissory note. The unpaid principal balance of this note bears an annual interest rate
of nine point one two seven percent (9.127 per annum. The note will be due two months after executed. On August 6, 2024, the Company
received the 300,000 in full under such note. On September 10, 2024, and September 27, 2024, the Company repaid 100,000 and 150,000,
respectively, to the payee, leaving 50,000 in principal unpaid as of September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company recorded 3,513 in interest expenses under the promissory note - third party. As of September 30, 2024, the total
outstanding under the promissory note- third party was 53,513. On October 5, 2024, the remaining principal of 50,000 was due and
will be payable on demand. Up to the date the financial statements were issued, the principal of 50,000 remained unpaid and past due. 

Going Concern Consideration 

The Company expects to incur significant costs
in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in
accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an Initial Business
Combination by August 12, 2025 (subject to the Amended Extension Payment is made as required for each monthly extension), the requirement
that the Company cease all operations, redeem the Public Shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve raises substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The balance sheet does not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying financial statement has been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America GAAP ), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

23 

Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. The underwriter is entitled to a deferred fee of three point five percent (3.50 of the gross proceeds of the Offering upon closing of the Business Combination, or 2,587,499. On March 4, 2024, we and the underwriter, entered into a satisfaction and discharge of indebtedness pursuant to underwriting agreement dated August 9, 2022 (the Satisfaction and Discharge Agreement ), pursuant to which, the underwriter agrees to revise the deferred underwriting fee of 2,587,499, to (1) 750,000 in cash on the date of the closing of the initial business combination (the Closing and (2) 200,000 of registered and unrestricted shares of us, shall be issued and delivered to the underwriter at the Closing. The deferred fee will be paid in cash upon the closing of a Business Combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. As of September 30, 2024, there were no critical accounting estimates. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

Management does not believe that any recently
issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s unaudited
financial statements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations; Quarterly Results 

As of the date of this report, we did not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or
contractual obligations. No unaudited quarterly operating data is included in this report as we have conducted no operations to
date. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
