CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORW ARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 (the Quarterly Report") contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding our future operating results and financial position; the success, cost, and timing of development of our product candidates, including the progress of non-clinical, preclinical studies and clinical trials and related milestones; the commercialization of our current product candidates and any other product candidates we may identify and pursue, if approved, including our ability to successfully build a specialty sales force and commercial infrastructure to market our current product candidates and any other product candidates we may identify and pursue; the timing of and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals; our business strategy and plans; potential acquisitions, partnerships and other strategic arrangements; the ability to generate revenue from any current or future licensing agreements and other strategic arrangements, the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term securities to fund our operations; available funding under the Hercules Capital, Inc. loan facility; and the plans and objectives of management for future operations and capital expenditures. The words believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, expect, could, would, project, plan, potentially, preliminary, likely, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
 
 We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees, and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: we are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company and have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never be profitable; if we are unable to obtain funding when needed and on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay, limit or discontinue our product candidate development efforts; our limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business and to assess our future viability; we rely on third parties to assist in conducting our clinical trials and some aspects of our research and preclinical testing; we currently rely on qualified therapists working at third-party clinical trial sites to administer certain of our product candidates in our clinical trials and we expect this to continue upon approval, if any, of our current or future product candidates, and if third-party sites fail to recruit and retain a sufficient number of therapists or effectively manage their therapists, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed; our product candidates are in preclinical or clinical development, which is a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes, and we cannot give any assurance that any of our product candidates will be successfully developed and/or receive regulatory approval, which is necessary before they can be commercialized; research and development of drugs targeting the central nervous system, or CNS, is particularly difficult, and it can be difficult to predict and understand why a drug has a positive effect on some patients but not others, which may reduce the likelihood our product candidates are ultimately approved and therefore may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results; the production and sale of our product candidates may be considered illegal or may otherwise be restricted due to the use of controlled substances, which may also have consequences for the legality of investments from foreign jurisdictions and therefore we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates in such jurisdictions, which will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; we face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological and scientific change, and there is a possibility that our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before we do or develop therapies that are safer, more advanced or more effective than ours, which may negatively impact our ability to successfully market or commercialize any product candidates we may develop and ultimately harm our financial condition; if we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for our existing product candidates or any other product candidates that we may identify, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection we currently have or obtain in the future is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize product candidates similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our existing product candidates and any other product candidates that we may pursue may be impaired; third parties may claim that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts; our future success depends on our ability to retain key employees, directors, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; as a result of covenants related to our Loan Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., our operating activities may be restricted and we may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness in the event of a breach by us, or an event of default thereunder, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business; if we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired; our business is subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations; a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may materially and adversely affect our business, including our preclinical studies, clinical trials, trial sites, third parties on whom we rely, our supply chain, our ability to raise capital, our ability to conduct regular business and our financial results, and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions described under Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of Part II and elsewhere in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "Form 10-K"), as further updated in Management s

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report, and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ).

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, performance, or achievements reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or will occur. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (unaudited) 
 million, restricted cash of million, and short-term securities of million and its accumulated deficit was million. The Company has historically financed its operations through the sale of equity securities, debt financings, sale of convertible notes and revenue generated from licensing and collaboration arrangements. The Company has not generated any revenues to date from the sale of its product candidates and does not anticipate generating any revenues from the sale of its product candidates unless and until it successfully completes development and obtains regulatory approval to market its product candidates. The Company currently expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued.

million, which was reported as Loss on deconsolidation of a variable interest entity, a component of other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company concluded that the decision to deconsolidate Psyber, which was based on resource capital allocation decisions, did not represent a significant strategic shift that would have a material effect on the Company's operations and financial results. Therefore, the Company did not present the results of Psyber prior to deconsolidation as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. TryptageniX, Inc. In December 2023, the Company finalized and entered into a Framework Agreement with CB Therapeutics, Inc. ("CBT") through which the Company transferred its equity interest in TryptageniX Inc. ("TryptageniX") to CBT in exchange for certain intellectual property and an Amended and Restated Development Services and Exclusive License Agreement. As a result of the disposition, the Company ceased having controlling financial interest in TryptageniX. The Company determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary, no longer had the power to direct the significant activities of TryptageniX, and accordingly, deconsolidated TryptageniX. The Company derecognized all of TryptageniX 's assets and liabilities from its consolidated balance sheet, and recognized a gain of million, which was reported as Gain on deconsolidation of a variable interest entity, a component of other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company concluded that the decision to deconsolidate TryptageniX, which was based on resource capital allocation decisions, did not represent a significant strategic shift that would have a material effect on the Company's operations and financial results. Therefore, the Company did not present the results of TryptageniX prior to deconsolidation as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the assets of the consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle the obligations of the respective VIEs. The liabilities of the consolidated VIEs are obligations of the respective VIEs and their creditors have no recourse to the general credit or assets of atai. PsyProtix, Inc. On February 3, 2021, PsyProtix, Inc. ("PsyProtix") was created as a joint venture between the Company and Chymia (the Founders ), with the intent of PsyProtix becoming a newly formed corporate subsidiary of ATAI. PsyProtix was created for the purpose of exploring and developing a metabolomics-based precision psychiatry approach. Based on the Company's assessment of the transaction at the time of acquisition, the Company concluded that PsyProtix was not a business and accounted for the Company's investment as an initial consolidation of a VIE that is not a business under ASC 810. In April 2024, the Company and Chymia entered into a Framework Agreement which resulted in the Company's acquisition of Chymia's equity ownership of PsyProtix (the Stock Transfer ).

In March 2021, IntelGenx and the Company entered into the Strategic Development Agreement and Purchaser Rights Agreement PPA ), (described below). In 2023, IntelGenx and the Company entered into a subscription agreement (described below). Following the initial closing of the IntelGenx SPA (as defined below), the Company held a voting interest in IntelGenx. Pursuant to the PPA, the Company is entitled to designate a number of directors to the IntelGenx s board of directors in the same proportion as the shares of common stock held by the Company to the outstanding IntelGenx Common Shares. As of September 30, 2024, the Company maintains significant influence over IntelGenx through the Company's ownership interest in IntelGenx s equity and its right to noncontrolling representation on IntelGenx's board of directors. In May 2024, IntelGenx announced that its board of directors authorized IntelGenx to bring an application in the Quebec Superior Court to seek protection from creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act CCAA to allow time to review its strategic alternatives. IntelGenx was granted protection pursuant to an initial order ("Initial Order"), which also authorized interim debtor-in-possession financing ("DIP Financing") provided by the Company in order to allow IntelGenx to continue its operations during a restructuring process. Subsequently, IntelGenx obtained approval to implement a sale and investment solicitation process (the "SISP" and the approval, the "SISP Approval Order").

Common Stock Investment The Company s investment in GABA s common stock was accounted for in accordance with the equity method. In November 2020 the Company exercised its option to purchase additional shares of common stock of GABA at a price of approximately million pursuant to an Omnibus Amendment Agreement under which the Right of First Refusal and Co-Sale Agreement was amended.

Investment in securities at fair value The Company elected the fair value option for the securities in the investment portfolio. The fair value is based on quoted market prices, when available. When a quoted market price is not readily available, the Company uses the market price from its last sale of similar assets. The cash and cash equivalents held by the Company are categorized as Level 1 investments as quoted market prices are readily available for these investments. All other investments in the investment portfolio are categorized as Level 2 investments as inputs utilized to fair value these securities are either directly or indirectly observable, such as the market price from the last sale of similar assets. The Company purchases investment grade short-term debt securities which are rated by nationally recognized statistical credit rating organizations in accordance with its investment policy. This policy is designed to minimize the Company's exposure to credit losses and to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained at all times to meet anticipated cash flow needs. The unrealized gains and losses on the available-for-sale securities, represented by change in the fair value of the investment portfolio, is reported in other income (expense), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Since the investment in the

The Company determined that the Warrants and the Call Option do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument under ASC 815. The Company has classified the common shares as Level 2 assets and the Warrants and the Call Option as Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy. The Warrants and Call Option are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis and any changes in the fair value will be recorded as Change in fair value of assets and liabilities, net, a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, considering relevant facts and circumstances, the Company has estimated zero fair value for the Warrants and the Call Option (Note 5).

As of December 31, 2023, the Warrants and Call Option were recorded at fair value utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option pricing model is based on the estimated market value of the underlying IntelGenx Common Shares at the valuation measurement date, the remaining contractual term of the Warrants and Call Option, risk-free interest rates, expected dividends, and expected volatility of the price of the underlying IntelGenx Common Shares. The expected volatility is based on a peer group volatility which is a Level 3 input within the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the 2023 Initial Warrants, 2023 Subsequent Warrants, 2024 Warrants and Call Option were all (Note 5).

As of September 30, 2024 , considering relevant facts and circumstances, the Company has estimated the fair value of the various notes receivables with IntelGenx based on the fair value of the underlying collateral of the secured debt and the relative seniority of the debt. As the DIP loan is the senior secured debt, the Company will apply the fair value of the underlying collateral first to the DIP loan with the residual fair value in excess of the DIP Loan principal and interest being applied to the IntelGenx Term Loan. The Company has estimated the fair value of the underlying collateral, which includes the fair value of the intangible assets which was determined based on probability

Perception and InnarisBio, Inc. ("InnarisBio"). The fair value of the contingent consideration liability related parties was determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty liabilities was estimated based on the discounted cash flow valuation technique. The technique considered the following unobservable inputs: the probability and timing of achieving the specified milestones and royalties as of each valuation date, 

 the probability of executing the license agreement, 

 the expected first year of revenue, and 

 market-based discount rates. 

 Perception The fair value of the Perception contingent milestone and royalty liabilities could change in future periods depending on prospects for the outcome of R-Ketamine milestone meetings with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and whether the Company realizes a significant increase or decrease in sales upon commercialization. The most significant assumptions in the discounted cash flow valuation technique that impacts the fair value of the milestone contingent consideration are the projected milestone timing and the probability of the milestone being met. Further, significant assumptions in the discounted cash flow that impacts the fair value of the royalty contingent consideration are the projected revenue over ten years, the timing of royalties on commercial revenue, and the probability of success rate for a commercial R-Ketamine product. The valuations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, used inputs that were unobservable inputs with the most significant being the discount rates for royalties on projected commercial revenue and clinical milestones and probability of success estimates over the following ten years, which represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the contingent milestone and royalty liabilities for Perception was estimated to be million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 DemeRx In October 2023, the Company and DemeRx, Inc. entered into a Stock Purchase and Framework Agreement which resulted in the Company's acquisition of DemeRx, Inc. s equity ownership of DemeRx IB (the Stock Purchase ), in exchange for consideration that included, among other items, earn-out consideration of up to an additional million payable to DemeRx, Inc. ("DemeRx") contingent upon the achievement of certain development milestones directly related to DemeRx IB s oral capsule formulation of ibogaine DMX-1002 program. The earn-out consideration was recorded at fair value in contingent consideration as a liability under ASC 480 and the fair value is adjusted each quarter and reflected in other income and expense in the statement of operations. The fair value of the DemeRx contingent milestone could change in future periods depending on prospects for the outcome of ibogaine milestone meetings with the FDA or other regulatory authorities. The most significant assumptions in the discounted cash flow valuation technique that impacts the fair value of the milestone contingent consideration are the projected milestone timing and the probability of the milestone being met. The valuations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 used inputs that were unobservable inputs with the most significant being the discount rates and the probability of success of certain clinical milestones, which represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy.

The Company recorded a million income tax benefit and a million income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024 (the "Annual Report"). This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the section titled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report, and may be updated from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. 
 All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal years, which end on December 31. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this subsection to we, us, our, atai or the Company refer to atai and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Business Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company aiming to transform the treatment of mental health disorders. We were founded in 2018 in response to the significant unmet need and lack of innovation in the mental health treatment landscape. We are dedicated to efficiently developing innovative therapeutics to treat depression, anxiety, addiction, and other mental health disorders. By pooling resources and best practices, we aim to responsibly accelerate the development of new medicines to achieve clinically meaningful and sustained behavioral change in mental health patients. 
 We have a bold and ambitious vision: to heal mental health disorders so that everyone, everywhere can live a more fulfilled life. 
 Mental health disorders such as depression, substance use disorder, and anxiety, which are among our initial focus indications, are highly prevalent and estimated to affect more than one billion people globally. In addition, the total costs of mental health disorders are significant and expected to increase substantially. Between 2009 and 2019, spending on mental health care in the United States increased by more than 50 , reaching 225 billion, and a Lancet Commission report estimates the global economic cost will reach 16 trillion by 2030. While current treatments, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, are well established and effective for certain patients, a significant percentage of patients either respond inadequately or relapse, translating to a significant unmet patient need. 
 Since our inception in 2018, we have focused substantially all of our efforts and financial resources on acquiring and developing product and technology rights, establishing our platform, building our intellectual property portfolio and conducting research and development activities for our product candidates within our atai companies that we consolidate based on our controlling financial interest of such entities. We operate a decentralized model to enable scalable drug or technological development at our atai companies. Our atai companies drive the development of our programs and enabling technologies for which we have either acquired a controlling or significant interest in or created de novo. We believe that this model provides our development teams the support and incentives to rapidly advance their therapeutic candidates or technologies in a cost-efficient manner. We look to optimize deployment of our capital in order to maximize value for our stakeholders. 
 We provide our development teams with access to shared services including scientific, intellectual property, clinical, and regulatory support, as well as project management, research and development, market strategy, and development and corporate finance. Our global team of subject matter professionals provides deep domain expertise in areas such as mental health drug development and life sciences intellectual property. Development teams have access to relevant expertise specific to each stage of their development. We believe our knowledge and specialization in psychedelics and mental health continuously enhance the quality of the services we provide through the sharing of learnings and experiences across the teams. 
 We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception. Our net loss attributable to ATAI Life Sciences N.V. stockholders was 110.3 million and 21.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our accumulated deficit was 661.3 million and 550.9 million, respectively. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend substantially on the successful development and eventual commercialization of product candidates at our atai companies that we consolidate based on our controlling financial interest of such entities as determined under the variable interest entity model ("VIE model") or voting interest entity model ("VOE model"). We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. 
 Our historical losses resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities, as well as general and administrative costs associated with our operations. In the future, we intend to continue to conduct research and development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory compliance, market access, commercialization and business development activities that, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will result in incurring further significant losses for at least the next several years. Our operating losses stem primarily from the development of our mental health research programs. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums, and investor relations costs. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of 
 41 

equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. There can be no assurances, however, that our current operating plan will be achieved or that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 
 We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations to date primarily with proceeds from the sale of our common shares, issuances of convertible notes and a term loan. 
 Capital Allocation and Strategic Value Capture 
 Consistent with our strategy, we provide the necessary funding and operational support to our programs to maximize their probability of success in clinical development and commercialization. We also regularly review the status of our programs to assess whether there are alternative forms of ownership, partnership or other forms of collaboration that would optimize our economic interests and the success of our programs. To that end, we are focusing on clinical phase programs and business development that we expect to generate meaningful data in the near term, and, therefore, prioritizing programs and opportunities that we believe have the highest return potential and value. As a result, in late 2023, we finalized and entered into agreements through which we disposed of our equity interests in Psyber, Inc. and TryptageniX Inc. In 2024, our strategic investment in Beckley Psytech Limited added more programs to our diverse portfolio of clinical-stage psychedelic candidates with multiple upcoming clinical readouts. We are also exploring other opportunities, including but not limited to seeking strategic partnership options, for example, with Recognify Life Sciences, Inc. and Perception Neuroscience Holdings, Inc. 
 In February 2023, we implemented a realignment initiative resulting in a reduction in force of approximately 30 of our global workforce in order to more effectively allocate our research and development and other resources supporting the revised business and program priorities and to reduce operational costs. In February 2024, we conducted a reduction in force of approximately 10 of our global workforce, predominantly reducing redundancy in our general administrative functions to reduce operational costs. Refer to Note 20 in the Notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 for further information. 
 Our Core Clinical Programs 
 Our pipeline currently consists of therapeutic candidates across multiple neuropsychiatric indications. The table below summarizes the status of our core product candidate portfolio as of the date of this Quarterly Report. 

42 

Clinical Pipeline Recent Advancements 
 RL-007: Pro-Cognitive Neuromodulator for Cognitive Impairment Associated with Schizophrenia (CIAS) 
 Recent Advancements 
 RL-007 is an orally bioavailable compound that has demonstrated pro-cognitive effects in multiple pre-clinical and clinical studies, including two Phase 1 and two Phase 2 trials. 

The ongoing Phase 2b study is evaluating 20mg and 40mg of RL-007 versus placebo in patients living with CIAS. We expect to announce topline results in mid-2025. 

VLS-01 (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine; DMT for Treatment-Resistant Depression ("TRD") 
 Recent Advancements: 
 VLS-01 is a proprietary oral transmucosal film formulation of DMT applied to the buccal surface designed to fit within a two-hour in-clinic treatment paradigm. 

The United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") cleared the investigational new drug (the "IND") application for VLS-01, enabling us to proceed with our plans to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to assess the safety, efficacy and durability of response of repeated doses of VLS-01 buccal film in patients with TRD. 

We expect the Phase 2 study to be initiated in the U.S. around year-end 2024. 

EMP-01: R-enantiomer of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (R-MDMA) for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) 
 Recent Advancements 
 SAD is an area of high unmet medical need with approximately 18 million people in the U.S. diagnosed in the past year and no novel molecules approved in over two decades. 

EMP-01 is an oral formulation of R-MDMA that demonstrated a unique, dose-dependent subjective effect profile in a Phase 1 trial that was generally found to be more similar to classical psychedelics than to racemic MDMA. 

We expect to initiate an exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of EMP-01 in adults with SAD around year-end 2024. 

IBX-210: Intravenous (IV)-Ibogaine for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) 
 Recent Advancements 
 IBX-210 is a novel IV formulation of ibogaine, which is an indole alkaloid with potential for clinical benefit for substance use disorder 

We completed a productive FDA pre-IND meeting to initiate discussions and alignment on a modern ibogaine IND. 

We plan to run additional non-clinical studies prior to launching a Phase 1b study. 

Novel 5-HT2A Receptor Agonists 
 Recent Advancements 
 Discovery program to identify novel, non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR agonists for TRD using artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)-informed drug design and medicinal chemistry. 

We presented data at the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) annual meeting aimed to show that these compounds are promising chemical starting points for new analogs with further improved 5-HT2AR versus 5-HT2BR agonist selectivity that maintain translational antidepressant-like activity with potential for non-hallucinogenic effects.

Financial Overview 
 Since our inception in 2018, we have focused substantially all of our efforts and financial resources on acquiring and developing product and technology rights, establishing our platform, building our intellectual property portfolio and conducting research and development activities for our product candidates within our atai companies that we consolidate based on our controlling financial interest of such entities. We operate a decentralized model to enable scalable drug or technological development at our atai companies. Our atai companies drive the development of our programs and enabling technologies for which we have either acquired a controlling or significant interest in or created de novo. We believe that this model provides our development teams the support and incentives to rapidly advance their therapeutic candidates or technologies in a cost-efficient manner. We look to optimize deployment of our capital in order to maximize value for our stakeholders. 
 We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations to date primarily with proceeds from the sale of our common shares, issuances of convertible notes, and a term loan. 
 Factors and Trends Affecting our Results of Operations 
 We believe that the most significant factors affecting our results of operations include: 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 We believe that our ability to successfully develop innovative product candidates through our programs will be the primary factor affecting our future growth. Our approach to the discovery and development of our product candidates is still being demonstrated. As such, we do not know whether we will be able to successfully develop any of our product candidates. Developing novel product candidates requires a significant investment of resources over a prolonged period of time, and a core part of our strategy is to continue making sustained investments in this area. We have chosen to leverage our platform to focus initially on advancing our product candidates in the area of mental health. 
 All of our product candidates are still in development stages, and we have incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development costs for preclinical studies and clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will constitute the most significant part of our expenses in future periods in line with the advancement and expansion of the development of our product candidates. 
 Acquisitions/Investments 
 To continue to grow our business and to aid in the development of our various product candidates, we have strategically acquired and invested in companies that share our common goal towards advancing transformative treatments, including psychedelic compounds and digital therapeutics, for patients that suffer from mental health disorders. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 In August 2020, we adopted the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2020 Incentive Plan and the Hurdle Share Option Plan (the HSOP Plan ), which allowed us to grant stock-based awards to executive officers, directors, employees and consultants. 
 Effective April 23, 2021, we adopted and our shareholders approved the atai Life Sciences N.V. 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the 2021 Incentive Plan ). The 2021 Incentive Plan enables us to grant incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards and other stock-based awards to our executive officers, directors and other employees and consultants. Any shares subject to outstanding options originally granted under the 2020 Incentive Plan that terminate, expire or lapse for any reason without the delivery of shares to the holder thereof shall become available for issuance pursuant to the 2021 Incentive Plan. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP and follow the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of our financial position, results of operations and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 Any reference in these notes to applicable accounting guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative U.S. GAAP included in the Accounting Standards Codification ASC ), and Accounting Standards Update ASU issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ). 
 Consolidation 
 Since our inception, we have created wholly owned subsidiaries or made investments in certain controlled entities, including partially-owned subsidiaries for which we have majority voting interest under the VOE model or for which we are the primary beneficiary under the 
 44 

VIE model, which we refer to collectively as our consolidated entities. Ownership interests in consolidated entities that are held by entities other than us are reported as noncontrolling interests in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and unaudited condensed consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. The portion of net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests is presented as Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation. 
 Ownership interests in entities over which we have significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, are accounted for under either the alternative measurement pursuant to ASC 321 or as an equity method investment. Investments eligible for the measurement alternative under ASC 321 are carried at its initial cost, with remeasurements to fair value upon impairment or upon a price change observed in an orderly transaction of the same or similar investments. For equity method investments where we have not elected the fair value option, we record gains (losses) from investments in equity method investees, net of tax, for our proportionate share of the underlying company s net results until the investment balance is adjusted to zero. If we make subsequent additional investments in that same company, we may record additional gains (losses) based on changes to our investment basis and also may record additional income (loss) in equity method investments. If we have elected the fair value option for an equity investment, the fair value of the investments will be recognized upon acquisition and any changes in fair value will be recognized as a component of other income (expense), net. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 License Revenue 
 On March 11, 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the "Otsuka Agreement"), with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., LTD ("Otsuka"), under which we granted exclusive rights to Otsuka to develop and commercialize certain products containing arketamine in Japan for the treatment of depression and other select indications. We received an upfront, non-refundable payment of 20.0 million in June 2021 and we are also eligible to receive up to 35.0 million if certain development and regulatory milestones are achieved and up to 66.0 million in commercial milestones upon the achievement of certain commercial sales thresholds. We are eligible to receive tiered, royalties ranging from low-teens to high-teens on net sales of licensed products subject to reduction in certain circumstances. 
 For the foreseeable future, we may generate revenue from reimbursements of services under the Otsuka Agreement, as well as milestone payments under our current and/or future collaboration agreements. We do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products unless and until such time that our product candidates have advanced through clinical development and regulatory approval, if ever. We expect that any revenue we generate, if at all, will fluctuate from year-to-year as a result of the timing and amount of payments relating to such services and milestones and the extent to which any of our products are approved and successfully commercialized. Our ability to generate future revenues will also depend on our ability to complete preclinical and clinical development of product candidates or obtain regulatory approval for them. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, which include: 
 
 employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees engaged in research and development functions; 

expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including our agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contract research organizations ("CROs"); 

expenses incurred under agreements with consultants who supplement our internal capabilities; 

the cost of lab supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study materials and clinical trial materials; 

costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and 

payments made in connection with third-party licensing agreements. 

Research and development costs, including costs reimbursed under the Otsuka Agreement, are expensed as incurred, with reimbursements of such amounts being recognized as revenue. We account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received. 
 Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis for our product candidates and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, CROs, contract manufacturing organizations CMOs and research laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Our direct research and development expenses by program also include fees incurred under third-party license agreements. 
 45 

Certain internal research and development expenses consisting of employee and contractor-related costs are not allocated to specific product candidate programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product candidate programs under research and development expense. 
 Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future in connection with our planned preclinical and clinical development activities in the near term and in the future. 
 The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As such, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing products, including the uncertainty of whether (i) any clinical trials will be conducted or progress as planned or completed on schedule, if at all, (ii) we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and (iii) we successfully commercialize product candidates. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative ("G A") expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions, professional fees for legal, patent, accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, travel expenses and facility-related expenses, advertising, and information technology-related expenses. 
 We are actively controlling G A spend and expect that our on-going G A expenses will continue to decrease in the near future. We may add more general and administrative head count in the future to support the potential commercialization of our product candidates. 
 Other income (expense), net 
 Interest income 
 Interest income consists of interest earned on cash balances held in interest-bearing accounts and interest earned on notes receivable. We expect that our interest income will fluctuate based on the timing and ability to raise additional funds as well as the amount of expenditures for the research and development of our product candidates and ongoing business operations. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense incurred in connection with our 2022 Term Loan Facility, defined below. 
 Benefit from research and development tax credit 
 Benefit from research and development tax credit consists of tax credits received in Australia under the Research and Development Tax Incentive, or RDTI, program. Qualifying expenditures include employment costs for research staff, consumables, and relevant, permitted CRO costs incurred as part of research projects. 
 Change in fair value of assets and liabilities, net 
 The Company carries various assets and liabilities at fair value and subsequent remeasurements are recorded as a Change in fair value of assets and liabilities, net as a component of Other income (expense), net. Assets held at fair value include securities held at fair value, investments held at fair value, and convertible notes receivable. Liabilities held at fair value include contingent considerations, short-term convertible promissory notes and derivative liability, debtor-in-possession loan commitment, and warrant liability. 
 Change in fair value of securities carried at fair value 
 Change in fair value of securities consists of changes in fair value of our available for sale securities for which we have elected the fair value option. 
 Change in fair value of short-term notes receivable - related party, net 
 Change in fair value of short-term notes receivable - related party, net, consists of subsequent remeasurements of our notes receivable with IntelGenx for which we have elected the fair value option. 
 Change in fair value of short-term convertible notes receivable - related party 
 Change in fair value of short-term convertible notes receivable - related party, consists of subsequent remeasurements of our convertible notes receivable with IntelGenx for which we have elected the fair value option. 
 46 

Change in fair value of other investments held at fair value 
 Change in fair value of other investments held at fair value consists of subsequent remeasurements of our investments held at fair value, including COMPASS Pathways plc ("COMPASS"), IntelGenx Technologies Corp. ("IntelGenx"), and Beckley Psytech Limited ("Beckley Psytech") for which we have elected the fair value option. 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration liability - related parties 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration liability - related parties, consists of subsequent remeasurements of our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of Perception Neuroscience Holdings, Inc. for which we record at fair value. 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration liability 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration liability, consists of subsequent remeasurements of our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of DemeRx IB, Inc. ("DemeRx IB") and TryptageniX, Inc. ("TryptageniX") for which we record at fair value. 
 Change in the fair value of short-term convertible promissory notes and derivative liability 
 Change in fair value of short-term convertible promissory notes and derivative liability consists of subsequent remeasurements of certain convertible notes issued in 2020. 
 Change in fair value of subsequent debtor-in-possession loan commitment 
 Change in fair value of subsequent debtor-in-possession loan commitment consists of subsequent remeasurements of our liability for the remaining balance of the credit facility between the Company and IntelGenx (the DIP Loan for which we have elected the fair value option. 
 Gain on deconsolidation of a variable interest entity 
 Gain on deconsolidation of a variable interest entity is the result of removing assets and liabilities from our consolidated balance sheet following a loss of control or divestment of a variable interest entity. 
 Foreign exchange gain (loss), net 
 Foreign exchange gain (loss), net consists of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign exchange denominated assets and liabilities, relative to the U.S. dollar. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations fluctuates period over period based on our foreign currency exposures resulting from changes in applicable exchange rates associated with our foreign denominated assets and liabilities. 
 Other income (expense), net 
 Other income (expense), net consists principally of the impact of accounting adoptions, changes in the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, or net gains (losses) recognized on the sale of certain of our assets. 
 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes 
 For our consolidated entities, deferred income taxes are provided for the effects of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. 
 We regularly assess the need to record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we maintain a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets for all entities as of September 30, 2024. In assessing the realizability on deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The future realization of deferred tax assets is subject to the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (e.g., ordinary income or capital gain) as provided under the carryforward provisions of local tax law. 
 We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the effect in available carryback and carryforward periods), future projected taxable income, including the character and jurisdiction of such income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. 
 Unrecognized tax benefits arise when the estimated benefit recognized in the financial statements differs from the amounts taken or expected to be taken in a tax return because of the considerations described above. As of September 30, 2024, we had no additional unrecognized tax benefits and the Company accrued interest on the tax positions recognized in 2023 through September 30, 2024. 
 Losses from Investments in Equity Method Investees, Net of Tax 
 Losses from investments in equity method investees, net of tax consists of our share of equity method investees losses on the basis of our equity ownership percentage related to our equity method investments. 
 47 

Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations is a result of our investments in certain of our consolidated VIEs and consists of the portion of the net loss of these consolidated entities that is not allocated to us. Net losses in consolidated VIEs are attributed to noncontrolling interests considering the liquidation preferences of the different classes of equity held by the shareholders in the VIE and their respective interests in the net assets of the consolidated VIE in the event of liquidation, and their pro rata ownership. Changes in the amount of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests are directly impacted by changes in the net loss of our VIEs and our ownership percentage changes.

The 0.9 million decrease was primarily attributable to 2.2 million increase of direct costs in our clinical programs as discussed below, mostly offset by 0.5 million decrease of costs related to our enabling technologies and drug discovery platform as discussed below, 2.4 million decrease in personnel expenses (inclusive of 1.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation), and a 0.2 million decrease in professional services costs and other costs. 
 Psychedelic Programs 
 VLS-01: N,N-dimethyltryptamine; DMT for Treatment Resistant Depression 
 The 0.4 million increase in direct costs for our VLS-01 program was primarily due to 1.1 million increase of clinical development costs related to our Phase 1b trial of VLS-01 designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK and PD of VLS-01 delivered using our proprietary OTF formulation as well as our upcoming randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. These costs were partially offset by 0.5 million decrease in preclinical development costs and 0.2 million decrease in manufacturing costs. 
 IBX-210 DMX-1002: Ibogaine for Opioid Use Disorder 
 The 0.9 million increase in direct costs was primarily due to 0.7 million of preclinical development costs, 0.3 million of clinical development costs, and 0.2 million of manufacturing costs related to the IBX-210 program in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 0.2 million of clinical development costs, 0.1 million of manufacturing costs, and 0.1 million of personnel costs related to conduct our DMX-1002 Phase 1/2 trial in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Novel 5-HT2A Receptor Agonists 
 The 0.3 million increase in direct costs for novel 5-HT2A receptor agonists was primarily due to an increase of 0.6 million of preclinical development costs, partially offset by a 0.3 million decrease in manufacturing costs. 
 EMP-01: 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) derivative for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder 
 The 0.2 million decrease in direct costs for our EMP-01 program was primarily due to 0.3 million decrease in clinical development costs relating to our Phase 1 single ascending dose trial to assess the safety and tolerability of orally administered EMP-01. These were partially offset by 0.1 million increase in manufacturing costs. 
 Non-Psychedelic Programs 
 RL-007: Pro-Cognitive Neuromodulator for Cognitive Impairment Associated with Schizophrenia 
 The 1.5 million increase in direct costs for our RL-007 program was due to 1.5 million increase of clinical development costs relating to our Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trial for RL-007 in CIAS.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our accumulated deficit was 661.3 million and 550.9 million, respectively. We expect to continue to incur losses and operating cash outflows for the foreseeable future as we continue working towards commercializing any of our product candidates. Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, short-term securities, convertible promissory notes, investments, sales of common shares under our at-the-market equity offering program, and the 2022 Term Loan Facility, as further described below. We maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits. 
 Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are clinical trial costs, manufacturing costs, nonclinical and other research and development costs, funding of strategic investments, public company compliance costs and general corporate needs. Because our product candidates are in various stages of clinical and pre-clinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity or debt financings, collaboration arrangements, license agreements, other business development opportunities with third parties and government grants.

 Investments 
 A significant potential source of liquidity resides in our investment in ADSs of COMPASS, subject to market conditions. Based on quoted market prices, the market value of our ownership in COMPASS was 43.5 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 In September 2024, the Company sold 2,660,000 ADSs of COMPASS at a price of 6.05 per ADS in an open market transaction, resulting in net proceeds received of 16.1 million. 
 ATM Agreement 
 In November 2022, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Jefferies LLC Jefferies ), pursuant to which we may issue and sell our common shares, having an aggregate offering price of up to 150,000,000, from time to time through an at-the-market equity offering program under which Jefferies will act as sales agent. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, Jefferies could sell the common shares by any method deemed to be an at-the-market offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. There have been no sales under the Sales Agreement through September 30, 2024. 
 Hercules Term Loan 
 In August 2022, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, with Hercules Capital, Inc., which was most recently amended in August 2024. See Liquidity Risks Indebtedness Hercules Term Loan for additional information. 
 Liquidity Risks 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 30.0 million, restricted cash of 15.0 million, and short-term securities of 56.0 million. Based on our current operating plan, we estimate that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term securities, and committed term loan funding as of the date this Quarterly Report will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months and we believe will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2026. 
 We expect to continue to incur substantial additional expenditures in the near term to support our ongoing activities. Additionally, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs as a result of operating as a public company. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to fund our product development and clinical operations as well as commercialization of our product candidates, will depend on the amount and timing of cash received from planned financings. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the time and cost necessary to complete ongoing and planned clinical trials; 

the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA, the EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; 

the progress, timing, scope and costs of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and other related activities for our ongoing and planned clinical trials, and potential future clinical trials; 

the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities, or entering into strategic collaborations with third parties to leverage or access these capabilities; 

the amount and timing of sales and other revenues from our product candidates, if approved, including the sales price and the availability of coverage and adequate third party reimbursement; 

56 

the cash requirements for purchasing additional equity from certain atai companies upon the achievement of specified development milestone events; 

the cash requirements for developing our programs and our ability and willingness to finance their continued development; 

the cash requirements for any future acquisitions or discovery of product candidates; and 

the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments, including other products that may compete with one or more of our product candidates. 

A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Further, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans. If we are unable to obtain this funding when needed and on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity financings, debt financings, collaborations with other companies and other strategic transactions. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Further, our operating plans may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research and development activities. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated product development programs.

We may make payments of interest only, without any loan amortization payments until September 1, 2025, which date may be extended to March 1, 2026 if Extension Condition Two is achieved. At the end of the interest only period, we are required to begin repayment of the outstanding principal of the 2022 Term Loan Facility in equal monthly installments. 
 As collateral for the obligations under the 2022 Term Loan Facility, we have granted to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders a senior security interest in substantially all of our cash and investment accounts and each Subsidiary Guarantor s property (including a pledge of equity interests of certain subsidiaries and VIEs), exclusive of intellectual property, with certain limited exceptions set forth in the Hercules Loan Agreement.

 Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations and Commitments 
 We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, while others are considered future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of milestone payments under existing license agreements. For information regarding our other contractual obligations, refer to Note 10. Leases , Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies , and Note 17. License Agreements and Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K. 
 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2, Basis of Presentation, Consolidation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements appearing under Part 1, Item 1 for more information. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our critical accounting policies are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Form 10-K and in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K. As disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. During the period covered by this Quarterly Report, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those discussed in our Form 10-K other than those disclosed in Note 2 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, our portfolio of notes receivables is exposed to credit risk in the form of non-payment or non-performance. In mitigating our credit risk, we consider multiple factors, including the duration and terms of the note and the nature of and our relationship with the counterparty. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. As of September 30, 2024 we had cash and cash equivalents of 30.0 million, restricted cash of 15.0 million, and short-term securities of 56.0 million. We generally hold our cash in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts and short-term securities. Due to the nature of our cash and investment portfolio, a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our cash. Our cash is held for working capital purposes. We purchased investment grade short-term debt securities which are rated by nationally recognized statistical credit rating organizations in accordance with its investment policy. This policy is designed to minimize our exposure to credit losses and to ensure that the adequate liquidity is maintained at all times to meet anticipated cash flow needs. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 0.4 million in convertible promissory notes, which was comprised of non-interest-bearing borrowings under the 2018 Convertible Notes. Based on the principal amounts of the convertible promissory notes and the interest rate assigned to the convertible promissory notes, a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our convertible promissory notes, financial position or results of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of our short and long-term notes receivables was an aggregate amount of 5.7 million. Based on the principal amounts of the notes receivable and the interest rates assigned to each note receivable as per their respective contracts, a hypothetical 10 change in the interest rates would not have a material impact on our notes receivables, financial position or results of operations. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Our reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the respective local currency. The assets and liabilities of each of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Equity transactions are 
 60 

translated using historical exchange rates. Expenses are translated using the average exchange rate during the previous month. Gains or losses due to transactions in foreign currencies are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in foreign exchange gains and losses related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the event our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, revenue, or expenses increase, our results of operations may be more greatly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which we do business, resulting in unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses. We have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions to date, although we may choose to do so in the future. 
 A hypothetical 10 change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies during any of the periods presented would not have had a material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, but could result in significant unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses for any given period. 
 Item 4. Controls and P rocedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
