 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

 The Fund has provided discussion of significant
accounting policies in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data within its 2023 Annual Report. There have
been no significant changes to the Fund s significant accounting policies during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

There were no impairments of oil and gas properties
during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Fluctuations in oil and natural gas commodity prices may impact
the fair value of the Fund s oil and gas properties. In addition, significant declines in oil and natural gas commodity prices could
reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable, which could result in impairment. 

of total capital contributions, net of cumulative dry-hole
well costs incurred by the Fund and fully depleted project investments. During 2021, the Fund began recording costs, totaling thousand
per quarter, representing reimbursements to the Manager, related to services provided by the Manager for accounting and investor relations.
Such costs are included on the statements of operations within general and administrative expenses. Management reimbursement costs during
each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were thousand and thousand, respectively. 

The Manager is also entitled to receive of
the cash distributions from operations made by the Fund. Distributions paid to the Manager during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 were 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively. Distributions paid to the Manager during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023 were 0.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively. 

The Fund utilizes Beta Sales and Transport, LLC,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Manager, to facilitate the transportation and sale of oil and natural gas produced from the Beta Project. 

The Fund is a party to a production handling,
gathering and operating services agreement PHA with affiliated entities and other third-party working interest owners
in the Claiborne Project. Under the terms of the PHA, the Claiborne Project producers have agreed to pay the Beta Project owners a fixed
production handling fee for each barrel of oil and mcf of natural gas processed through the Beta Project production facility. During the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund earned thousand and thousand, respectively, representing its proportionate
share of the production handling fees earned from affiliates, which are included within Other revenue on the Fund s
statements of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Fund earned thousand and million, respectively,
representing its proportionate share of the production handling fees earned from affiliates, which are included within Other revenue 
on the Fund s statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Fund s receivables of thousand
and thousand, respectively, related to the Fund s proportionate share of revenue from affiliates are included within Due
from affiliate on the Fund s balance sheets. The receivables are settled by issuance of a non-cash credit from the Beta Project
operator to the Fund on behalf of the Claiborne Project working interest owners when the operator performs the joint interest billing
of the lease operating expenses due from the Fund. However, if applying the joint interest billing credit results in a net credit balance
due to the Fund, the Beta Project operator remits such balance in cash to the Fund. 

At times, short-term payables and receivables,
which do not bear interest, arise from transactions with affiliates in the ordinary course of business. 

The Fund has working interest ownership in certain
oil and natural gas projects, which are also owned by other entities that are likewise managed by the Manager. 

million (which include asset retirement obligations for the Fund s
projects of million), of which million is expected to be spent during the next twelve months. Future results of operations and
cash flows are dependent on the revenues from production and sale of oil and natural gas from the Beta Project. 

Based upon its current cash position, salvage
fund and its current reserves estimates, the Fund expects cash flow from operations to be sufficient to cover its commitments and ongoing
operations. Reserves estimates are projections based on engineering data that cannot be measured with precision, require substantial judgment,
and are subject to frequent revision. 

Impact from Market Conditions 

 Although the oil market demonstrated stability during the first half of
2024, oil prices started declining during August 2024 and September 2024. Management believes the major headwind for the crude market
remains China s weakening economy, as well as the potential for a broader global recession, which could include an economic slowdown
in the U.S. In addition, OPEC Plus is scheduled to start gradually easing its output curbs in December 2024. The physical crude market,
however, continues to be tight and is expected to remain so for the remainder of the year. In addition, ongoing geopolitical conditions,
including the military conflicts between Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Iran (and proxies) and the global response to such conflicts, and acts
of terrorism, will continue to influence oil and natural gas commodity prices. The impact of these issues on global financial and commodity
markets and their corresponding effect on the Fund remains uncertain. 

Environmental and Governmental Regulations

Many aspects of the oil and gas industry are subject
to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. The Manager and operators of the Fund s properties are continually
taking action they believe appropriate to satisfy applicable federal, state and local environmental regulations. However, due to the significant
public and governmental interest in environmental matters related to those activities, the Manager cannot predict the effects of possible
future legislation, rule changes, or governmental or private claims. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no known
environmental contingencies that required adjustment to, or disclosure in, the Fund s financial statements aside from the following: 

On August 19, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland issued a decision in Sierra Club,
et al. (Plaintiffs) v. National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS ), et al. (Defendants), and American Petroleum Institute,
et al. (Intervenors) , which vacated the U.S. Department of Commerce, NMFS 2020 programmatic Biological Opinion on the Federally Regulated
Oil and Gas Program Activities in the Gulf of Mexico (the 2020 BiOp ), and corresponding Incidental Take Statement ITS ),
for violations of the Endangered Species Act ESA . The court made the vacatur of the 2020 BiOp effective as
of December 20, 2024. The defendants in the Sierra Club Case filed an appeal and, alternatively, asked the Maryland Court for a stay of
its order to vacate, pending the appeal. On October 21, 2024, the Maryland Court extended the vacatur of the 2020 BiOp to May 21, 2025.
The ESA, among other things, requires federal agencies to ensure that agency action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of any endangered or threatened species. Any agency whose action may affect ESA protected species, i.e., the action
agency, must consult the expert agency before taking that action. Those ESA consultations are formalized in a biological
opinion, and if the expert agency concludes that the action is likely to jeopardize a species or result in harm to its habitat, i.e., a
jeopardy determination, then the expert agency must also propose a reasonable prudent alternative RPA to avoid those adverse
effects. NMFS has previously undertaken multiple consultations relating to federal oil and gas leases in the GOM OCS using a broad or
"programmatic" approach, meaning that the resulting BiOp issued in March 2020 was intended to cover all federal
activities associated with all oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf OCS under
existing and new leases through 2029. The 2020 BiOp concluded that no ESA-listed species would be jeopardized by oil and gas leases except
the Rice's whale which then had an RPA analysis and corresponding ITS prepared associated with it. NMFS has indicated that a new BiOp
would not be issued until late winter/early spring 2025 at the earliest. The Fund cannot at this time predict how this matter may impact
the Fund s operations. 

Oil and gas industry legislation and administrative
regulations are periodically changed for a variety of political, economic, and other reasons. Any such future laws and regulations could
result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Fund s
operating results and cash flows. It is not possible at this time to predict whether such legislation or regulation, if proposed, will
be adopted as initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted would impact the Fund s business. 

BSEE and BOEM Supplemental Financial Assurance
Requirements 

 On October 16, 2020, the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management BOEM and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement BSEE published a proposed new rule
entitled Risk Management, Financial Assurance and Loss Prevention to update BOEM s financial assurance criteria and
other BSEE-administered regulations. Upon review of the 2020 joint proposed rule and analysis of public comments, the Secretary of the
U.S. Department of the Interior Interior elected to separate the BOEM and BSEE portions of the supplemental bonding requirements.
BSEE finalized some provisions from the 2020 proposal as discussed below. BOEM rescinded its portion of the 2020 proposed rule and
issued its new rule below. 

On April 18, 2023, BSEE published a final rule
at 88 FR 23569 on Risk Management, Financial Assurance and Loss Prevention effective May 18, 2023 to clarify and formalize its regulations
related to decommissioning responsibilities of OCS oil, gas, and sulfur lessees and grant holders
to ensure compliance with lease, grant, and regulatory obligations. The rule implements provisions of the proposed rule intended
to clarify decommissioning responsibilities of right-of-use and easement grant holders and to formalize BSEE's policies regarding performance
by predecessors ordered to decommission OCS facilities. The final rule withdraws the proposal set forth in the 2020 proposed rule to amend
BSEE's regulations to require BSEE to proceed in reverse chronological order against predecessor lessees, owners of operating rights,
and grant holders when requiring such entities to perform their accrued decommissioning obligations if the current lessees, owners, or
holders have failed to perform. In addition, BSEE also decided not to finalize the proposed appeal bonding requirements in this
final rule. 

On April 24, 2024, BOEM published a final rule
at 89 FR 31544 on Risk Management and Financial Assurance for OCS Lease and Grant Obligations, effective June 29, 2024. This rule substantially
revises the supplemental financial assurance requirements for decommissioning offshore wells and infrastructure once they are no longer
in use. The rule establishes a simplified test using only two criteria by which BOEM would determine whether supplemental financial assurance
should be required of OCS oil and gas lessees: (1) credit rating, and (2) the ratio of the value of proved oil and gas reserves of the
lease to the estimated decommissioning liability associated with the reserves. If a current lessee meets one of these criteria, it will
not be required to provide supplemental financial assurance. In addition, as it relates to supplemental financial assurance requirements
for OCS oil and gas right-of-use and easement grant holders, BOEM will only consider the first criteria i.e., credit rating. Under
the rule, BOEM would no longer consider or rely upon the financial strength of prior grant holders and lessees in determining whether,
or how much, supplemental financial assurance should be provided by the current grant holders and lessees. The rule would allow existing
lessees and grant holders to request phased-in payments over three years to meet the new financial assurance amounts. On June 28, 2024,
BOEM issued a timeline on its website for implementing the rule. BOEM indicates that it will begin sending out notices to companies to
submit financial and property information, to which such companies have six months to respond. BOEM can take up to 18 months from
receipt of such information to complete its review and an additional six months thereafter to complete financial assurance demands. 
Moreover, on June 17, 2024, the States of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi, along with several industry advocate groups, filed a lawsuit
in federal court in Louisiana challenging many parts of the rule and BOEM s statutory power to issue it. That litigation
is ongoing. The Fund is still evaluating the impact of the new rule on its operations and financial condition and the impact is currently
uncertain. The Fund will continue to maintain the salvage fund, a separate interest-bearing account, to fund its proportionate share of
the estimated future costs of decommissioning liabilities for its projects. The Fund will continue to reassess its estimated decommissioning
liabilities and reserve for additional funding as necessary. 

Insurance Coverage 

 The Fund is subject to all risks inherent in the
oil and natural gas business. Insurance coverage as is customary for entities engaged in similar operations is maintained, but losses
may occur from uninsurable risks or amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not insured or
not fully insured could have a material adverse impact upon earnings and financial position. Moreover, insurance is obtained as a package
covering all of the entities managed by the Manager. Depending on the extent, nature and payment of claims made by the Fund or other entities
managed by the Manager, yearly insurance coverage may be exhausted and become insufficient to cover a claim by the Fund in a given year.

except as required by law. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

There were no changes to the Fund s critical
accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Overview of the Fund s Business 

The Fund was organized primarily to acquire interests
in oil and natural gas properties located in the United States offshore waters of Texas, Louisiana and Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Fund s primary investment objective is to generate cash flow for distribution to its shareholders by generating returns across
a portfolio of oil and natural gas projects. Distributions to shareholders are made in accordance with the Fund s limited liability
company agreement (the LLC Agreement ). 

Ridgewood Energy Corporation (the Manager is the Manager, and as such, has direct and exclusive control over the management of the Fund s operations. The Manager performs,
or arranges for the performance of, the management, advisory and administrative services required for the Fund s operations. As
compensation for its services, the Manager is entitled to receive an annual management fee, payable monthly, equal to 2.5 of the total
capital contributions made by the Fund s shareholders, net of cumulative dry-hole well costs incurred by the Fund and fully depleted
project investments. During 2021, the Fund began recording costs related to services provided by the Manager for accounting and investor
relations. The Fund does not currently, nor is there any plan to, operate any project in which the Fund participates. The Manager enters
into operating agreements with third-party operators for the management of all exploration, development and producing operations, as appropriate.
The Manager also participates in distributions. 

Market Conditions 

Although the oil market demonstrated stability during the first half of
2024, oil prices started declining during August 2024 and September 2024. Management believes the major headwind for the crude market
remains China s weakening economy, as well as the potential for a broader global recession, which could include an economic slowdown
in the U.S. In addition, OPEC Plus is scheduled to start gradually easing its output curbs in December 2024. The physical crude market,
however, continues to be tight and is expected to remain so for the remainder of the year. In addition, ongoing geopolitical conditions,
including the military conflicts between Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Iran (and proxies) and the global response to such conflicts, and acts
of terrorism, will continue to influence oil and natural gas commodity prices. The impact of these issues on global financial and commodity
markets and their corresponding effect on the Fund remains uncertain.

Commodity Price Changes 

Changes in oil and natural
gas commodity prices may significantly affect liquidity and expected operating results. Significant declines in oil and natural gas commodity
prices not only reduce revenues and profits but could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable and result
in non-cash charges to earnings due to impairment and higher depletion rates. 

Aside from the decreases in August and September, the overall trend for
oil prices has been favorable so far in 2024, which positively impacted the cash flow generated by the Beta Project. In addition, the
Fund anticipates price cyclicality in its planning and believes it is well-positioned to withstand price volatility. The Fund will continue
to closely manage and coordinate its capital spending estimates within its expected cash flows to provide for the costs associated with
the well recompletions for the Beta Project, as budgeted. See Results of Operations under this Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report for more information on the average
oil and natural gas prices received by the Fund during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the effect of such
average prices on the Fund s results of operations. 

Market pricing for oil and natural gas is volatile
and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future. This volatility is caused by numerous factors and market conditions that the Fund
cannot control or influence. Therefore, it is impossible to predict the future price of oil and natural gas with any certainty. Factors
affecting market pricing for oil and natural gas include: 

worldwide economic, political and social conditions
impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas, which may be driven by various risks, including war (such as the invasion
of Ukraine by Russia and the evolving Israel-Iran (and proxies) conflict), terrorism, political unrest, or health epidemics; 

weather conditions; 

economic conditions, including the impact of
continued inflation and associated changes in monetary policy and demand for petroleum-based products; 

actions by OPEC Plus, the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies; 

political instability in the Middle East and
other major oil and gas producing regions; 

governmental regulations (inclusive of impacts
of climate change), both domestic and foreign; 

domestic and foreign tax policy; 

the pace adopted by foreign governments for the
exploration, development, and production of their national reserves; 

the supply and price of foreign oil and gas;

the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering
oil and gas; 

the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;

the rate of decline of existing and new oil and
gas reserves; 

available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation
capacity; 

the ability of oil and gas companies to raise
capital; 

the overall supply and demand for oil and gas;
and 

the price and availability of alternate fuel
sources.

The decrease in production days during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to storm-related safety shut-in during mid-September 2024. One Beta Project
well loaded up with water upon restart but came back on production in early October 2024. The decrease in production days during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 was also attributable to the scheduled maintenance shut-in during March 2024 at a third-party gas processing
facility through which natural gas production from the Beta Project flows. Production from the project resumed at the end of March 2024.
The decreases in sales volumes noted in the table above were primarily attributable to natural declines in production from the Beta Project s
wells. See additional discussion in the Business Update section above. 

Oil and Gas Revenue. Oil and gas
revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.5 million, a decrease of 0.3 million from the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased sales volume. 

Oil and gas revenue during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 was 1.6 million, a decrease of 0.7 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily
attributable to decreased sales volume. 

See Overview above for factors that
impact the oil and gas revenue volume and rate variances. 

Other Revenue. Other revenue is
generated from the Fund s production handling, gathering and operating services agreement with affiliated entities and other third
parties. 

Depletion and Amortization. 
Depletion and amortization during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2 million, a decrease of 0.3 million from the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in production volumes totaling 0.1 million, an adjustment
to the asset retirement obligation related to a fully depleted property totaling 0.1 million during the three months ended September
30, 2023 and a decrease in the average depletion rate totaling 0.1 million. 

Depletion and amortization during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was 0.7 million, a decrease of 0.8 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was
primarily attributable to a decrease in production volumes totaling 0.5 million, a decrease in the average depletion rate totaling 0.2
million and an adjustment to the asset retirement obligation related to a fully depleted property totaling 0.1 million during the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. 

The decreases in the average depletion rates were
primarily attributable to the changes in reserves estimates provided annually by the Fund s independent petroleum engineers. 

See Overview above for certain factors
that impact the depletion and amortization volume and rate variances. 

Operating Expenses . Operating expenses
represent costs specifically identifiable or allocable to the Fund s wells, as detailed in the following table.

Lease operating expense and transportation and
processing expense relate to the Fund s producing projects. Accretion expense relates to the asset retirement obligations established
for the Fund s oil and gas properties. Insurance expense represents premiums related to the Fund s projects, which vary depending
upon the number of wells producing or drilling. Workover expense represents costs to restore or stimulate production of existing reserves. 

Production costs, which include lease operating
expense, transportation and processing expense and insurance expense, were 0.1 million 10.70 per barrel of oil equivalent or BOE and 0.2 million 9.82 per BOE) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.1 million 8.56
per BOE) and 0.3 million 8.49 per BOE) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Table of Contents 

Production costs were relatively consistent during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in production
costs per BOE during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023
were primarily attributable to the Beta Project, which had higher production costs per BOE during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 primarily attributable to decreased production volumes. 

See Overview above for factors that
impact oil and natural gas production. 

General and Administrative Expenses . 
General and administrative expenses represent costs specifically identifiable or allocable to the Fund, such as accounting and professional
fees and insurance expenses. Management reimbursement costs related to services provided by the Manager for accounting and investor relations
are also included within general and administrative expenses. 

Interest Income. Interest income
is comprised of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and salvage fund. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

Operating Cash Flows 

 Cash flows provided by operating activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.4 million, primarily related to revenue received of 1.8 million and interest income
received of 0.1 million, partially offset by operating expenses of 0.3 million and general and administrative expenses of 0.2 million. 

Cash flows provided by operating activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 2.0 million, primarily related to revenue received of 2.6 million, partially offset by
operating expenses of 0.4 million, general and administrative expenses of 0.2 million and the settlement of asset retirement obligations
of 0.1 million. 

Investing Cash Flows 

 Cash flows used in investing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.1 million, primarily related to investments in salvage fund. 

Cash flows used in investing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 0.1 million, primarily related to investments in salvage fund of 0.1 million, partially
offset by proceeds from the salvage fund of 0.1 million. 

Financing Cash Flows 

 Cash flows used in financing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.1 million, related to manager and shareholder distributions. 

Cash flows used in financing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 1.8 million, related to manager and shareholder distributions. 

Capital Expenditures 

Capital expenditures for oil and gas properties
have been funded with the capital raised by the Fund in its private placement offering and through debt financing. The Fund s capital
has been fully invested and as a result, the Fund will not invest in any new projects and will limit its investment activities, if any,
to those projects in which it currently has a working interest. Such investment activities, which include estimated capital spending on
planned well recompletions for the Beta Project, are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations and existing cash-on-hand and
not from equity, debt or off-balance sheet financing arrangements. 

See Business Update under this Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report
for information regarding the Fund s current projects. See Liquidity Needs below for additional information. 

Liquidity Needs 

The Fund s primary short-term and long-term
liquidity needs are to fund its operations and capital expenditures for its oil and gas properties. Such needs are funded utilizing operating
income and existing cash on-hand. 

14 

 Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024, the Fund s estimated
capital commitments related to its oil and gas properties were 2.5 million (which include asset retirement obligations for the Fund s
projects of 1.4 million), of which 0.2 million is expected to be spent during the next twelve months. Future results of operations and
cash flows are dependent on the revenues from production and sale of oil and gas from the Beta Project. In addition, cash flow from operations
may be impacted by fluctuations in oil and natural gas commodity prices. Based upon its current cash position, salvage fund and its current
reserves estimates, the Fund expects cash flow from operations to be sufficient to cover its commitments and ongoing operations. Reserves
estimates are projections based on engineering data that cannot be measured with precision, require substantial judgment, and are subject
to frequent revision. 

Distributions, if any, are funded from available
cash from operations, as defined in the LLC Agreement, and the frequency and amount are within the Manager s discretion. However,
distributions may be impacted by amounts of future capital required for the costs associated with the well recompletions for the Beta
Project, as budgeted, as well as the funding of estimated asset retirement obligations. Distributions may also be impacted by fluctuations
in oil and natural gas commodity prices. 

Contractual Obligations 

The Fund enters into participation and joint operating
agreements with operators. On behalf of the Fund, an operator enters into various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development
and production activities. The Fund does not negotiate such contracts. No contractual obligations exist as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, other than those discussed in Capital Expenditures above.

Not required. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the Fund s management, including its Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the

as of September 30, 2024. 

There has been no change in the Fund s internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
