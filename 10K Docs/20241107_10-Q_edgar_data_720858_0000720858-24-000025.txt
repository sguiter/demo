 Provision charged to operations Payments of claims, net of recoveries ) ) Balance, end of period 

The total reserve for all reported and unreported losses the Company incurred through September 30, 2024 is represented by the reserve for claims on the unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are established using estimated amounts required to settle claims for which notice has been received (reported) and the amount estimated to be required to satisfy claims that have been incurred but not yet reported IBNR ). Despite the variability of such estimates, management believes that the total reserve for claims is adequate to cover claim losses which might result from pending and future claims under title insurance policies issued through September 30, 2024. Management continually reviews and adjusts its reserve for claims estimates to reflect its loss experience and any new information that becomes available. Adjustments resulting from such reviews could be significant.

IBNR Total reserve for claims 

Claims and losses paid are charged to the reserve for claims. Although claims losses are typically paid in cash, occasionally claims are settled by purchasing the interest of the insured or the claimant in the real property. When this event occurs, the Company carries assets at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, net of any indebtedness on the property.

 There were and thousand potential shares excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to the out-of-the-money status of the related share-based awards. There were thousand and thousand potential shares excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to the out-of-the-money status of the related share-based awards. 
 
 The Company historically has adopted employee stock award plans under which restricted stock, options or stock appreciation rights ("SARs") exercisable for the Company's stock may be granted to key employees or directors of the Company. There is currently one active plan from which the Company may grant share-based awards. The awards eligible to be granted under the active plan are limited to SARs, and the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock of the Company available pursuant to the plan for the grant of SARs is thousand shares. SARs give the holder the right to receive stock equal to the appreciation in the value of shares of stock from the grant date for a specified period of time, and as a result, are accounted for as equity instruments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the only outstanding awards under the plans were SARs, which expire within or less from the date of grant. All outstanding SARs vest and are exercisable within or less from the date of grant, and all SARs issued to date have been share-settled only. There have been stock options or SARs granted where the exercise price was less than the market price on the date of grant.

 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company issued thousand share-settled SARs to directors of the Company. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company issued thousand share-settled SARs to directors of the Company. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company issued thousand share-settled SARs to a director of the Company. There was such first quarter issuance of SARs during the first quarter of 2024. The fair value of each SAR is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on both the implied and historical volatility of the Company s stock. The Company uses historical data to project SAR exercises and pre-exercise forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected term of awards represents the period of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate assumed for the expected life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. and , respectively, and were estimated using the weighted average assumptions shown in the table below:

 The title insurance segment primarily issues title insurance policies through approved attorneys from underwriting offices and through independent issuing agents. Title insurance policies insure titles to real estate. 
 
 The tax-deferred exchange services segment acts as an intermediary in tax-deferred exchanges of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investments and serves as exchange accommodation titleholder, holding property for exchangers in reverse exchange transactions.

 Management evaluates available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in unrealized loss positions to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. The decline in estimated fair value of the fixed maturity securities can be attributed primarily to changes in market interest rates and changes in credit spreads over Treasury securities. 
 
 Factors considered in determining whether a loss is credit-related include the financial condition and prospects of the issuer (including credit ratings and analyst reports) and macro-economic changes. A total of and fixed maturity securities had unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company does not intend to sell any of these securities and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. The Company believes that the unrealized losses detailed in the previous table are due to noncredit-related factors, including changes in market interest rates and other market conditions, and therefore the unrealized loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.

 (a) Maximum potential loss is calculated as the total investment in the LLC or LP, including any capital commitments that may have not yet been called. The Company is not exposed to any loss beyond the total commitment of its investment. 
 
 Valuation of Financial Assets 
 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") has established a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs used to measure estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities, such as securities. This hierarchy categorizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company s own assumptions intended to represent market participant assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. 
 
 A financial instrument s classification within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement consequently, if there are multiple significant valuation inputs that are categorized in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument s hierarchy level is the lowest level (with Level 3 being the lowest level) within which any significant input falls. 
 
 The Level 1 category includes equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities that are measured at estimated fair value using quoted active market prices. 
 
 The Level 2 category includes fixed maturity securities such as corporate debt securities, U.S. government obligations, and obligations of U.S. states, territories, and political subdivisions. Estimated fair value is principally based on market values obtained from a third-party pricing service. Factors that are used in determining estimated fair market value include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data. The Company receives one quote per security from a third-party pricing service, although as discussed below, the Company does consult other pricing resources when confirming that the prices it obtains reflect the fair values of the instruments in accordance with GAAP. Generally, quotes obtained from the pricing service for instruments classified as Level 2 are not adjusted and are not binding. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not adjust any Level 2 fair values. 
 
 A number of the Company s investment grade corporate debt securities are frequently traded in active markets, and trading prices are consequently available for these securities. However, these securities are classified as Level 2 because the pricing service from which the Company has obtained estimated fair values for these instruments uses valuation models that use observable market inputs in addition to trading prices. Substantially all of the input assumptions used in the service s model are observable in the marketplace or can be derived or supported by observable market data. 
 
 In the measurement of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, other valuation techniques were utilized if quoted market prices were not available. These derived fair value estimates are significantly affected by the assumptions used. Additionally, certain financial instruments, including those related to insurance contracts, pension and other postretirement benefits, and equity method investments are excluded from the scope of disclosures.

 There were no transfers into or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the periods presented. 
 
 To help ensure that estimated fair value determinations are consistent with GAAP, prices from our pricing services go through multiple review processes to ensure appropriate pricing. Pricing procedures and inputs used to price each security include, but are not limited to, the following: unadjusted quoted market prices for identical securities such as stock market closing prices; non-binding quoted prices for identical securities in markets that are not active; interest rates; yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals; volatility; prepayment speeds; loss severity; credit risks; and default rates. The Company reviews the procedures and inputs used by its pricing services, and verifies a sample of the services quotes by comparing them to values obtained from other pricing resources. In the event the Company disagrees with a price provided by its pricing services, the respective service reevaluates the price to corroborate the market information and then reviews inputs to the evaluation in light of potentially new market data. 
 
 Certain measurement alternative equity investments and notes receivable are measured at estimated fair value on a non-recurring basis and are reviewed for impairment quarterly. If any such investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded against such investment and reflected in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were impairments of such investments made during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and impairments during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023.

In accordance with FASB's Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350, the Company determined that no events or changes in circumstances occurred during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 that would indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable, and therefore, determined that there were goodwill or title plant impairments.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Investors Title Company's (the "Company") Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K") as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") should be read in conjunction with the following discussion since it contains information which is important for evaluating the Company's operating results and financial condition. 
 
 In addition, the Company may make forward-looking statements in the following discussion and analysis. Forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary. See "Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this discussion and analysis, as well as the sections titled "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K for factors that could affect forward-looking statements. 

Overview 
 
 Title Insurance 
 
 The Company is a holding company that engages primarily in issuing title insurance through two subsidiaries, Investors Title Insurance Company ITIC and National Investors Title Insurance Company NITIC ). Through ITIC and NITIC, the Company underwrites land title insurance for owners and mortgagees as a primary insurer. Total revenues from the title segment accounted for 90.9 of the Company's revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Title insurance protects against loss or damage resulting from title defects that affect real property. When real property is conveyed from one party to another, occasionally there is an undisclosed defect in the title or a mistake or omission in a prior deed, will or mortgage that may give a third party a legal claim against such property. If a covered claim is made against real property, title insurance provides indemnification against insured defects. 
 
 There are two basic types of title insurance policies one for the mortgage lender and one for the real property owner. A lender often requires the property owner to purchase a lender s title insurance policy to protect its position as a holder of a mortgage loan, but the lender s title insurance policy does not protect the property owner. The property owner has to purchase a separate owner s title insurance policy to protect its investment. 
 
 The Company issues title insurance policies directly and through a network of agents. Issuing agents are typically real estate attorneys, independent agents or subsidiaries of community and regional mortgage lending institutions, depending on local customs and regulations and the Company s marketing strategy in a particular territory. The ability to attract and retain issuing agents is a key determinant of the Company s growth in title insurance premiums written. 
 
 Revenues for the title insurance segment primarily result from purchases of new and existing residential and commercial real estate, refinance activity and certain other types of mortgage lending such as home equity lines of credit. 
 
 Title insurance premiums vary from state to state and are subject to extensive regulation. Statutes generally provide that rates must not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The process of implementing a rate change in most states involves pre-approval by the applicable state insurance regulator. 
 
 Volume is a factor in the Company s profitability due to fixed operating costs that are incurred by the Company regardless of title insurance premium volume. The resulting operating leverage tends to amplify the impact of changes in volume on the Company s profitability. The Company s profitability also depends, in part, upon its ability to manage its investment portfolio to maximize investment returns and to minimize risks such as interest rate changes, defaults and impairments of assets. 
 
 The Company s volume of title insurance premiums is affected by the overall level of residential and commercial real estate activity, which includes property sales, mortgage financing and mortgage refinancing. Real estate activity, home sales and mortgage lending are cyclical in nature. Real estate activity is affected by a number of factors, including the availability of mortgage credit, the cost of real estate, consumer confidence, employment and family income levels, and general United States economic conditions. Interest rate volatility is also an important factor in the level of residential and commercial real estate activity. 
 
 The Company s title insurance premiums in future periods are likely to fluctuate due to these and other factors which are beyond management s control. 
 
 Historically, the title insurance business tends to be seasonal as well as cyclical. Because home sales are typically strongest in periods of favorable weather, the first calendar quarter tends to have the lowest activity levels, while the spring and summer quarters tend to be more active. Mortgage refinance activity tends to be influenced less by seasonality and more by economic cycles, with activity levels increasing during times of falling interest rates. 
 25 

Exchange Services 
 
 The Company s exchange services division, consisting of the operations of Investors Title Exchange Corporation ITEC and Investors Title Accommodation Corporation ITAC ), provides customer services in connection with tax-deferred real property exchanges. ITEC acts as a qualified intermediary in tax-deferred exchanges of real property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment, and its income is derived from fees for handling exchange transactions and a portion of the interest earned on client deposits held by the Company. In its role as qualified intermediary, ITEC coordinates the exchange aspects of the real estate transaction, and its duties include drafting standard exchange documents, holding the exchange funds between the time the old property is sold and the new property is purchased, and accepting the formal identification of the replacement property within the required identification period. ITAC provides services as an exchange accommodation titleholder for accomplishing parking transactions as set forth in the safe harbor contained in Internal Revenue Procedure 2000-37. These transactions include reverse exchanges when taxpayers decide to acquire replacement property before selling the relinquished property, or build to suit exchanges, when improvements must be made to the replacement property before the taxpayer acquires the improved replacement property. The services provided by the Company s exchange services division, ITEC and ITAC, are pursuant to provisions in the Internal Revenue Code. From time to time, these laws are subject to review and changes, which may negatively affect the demand for tax-deferred exchanges in general, and consequently, the revenues and profitability of the Company s exchange services division. 
 
 Management Services, Investment Management and Trust Services 
 
 Other services provided by operating divisions of the Company are not reported separately, but rather are reported collectively in a category called All Other. These other services include those offered by the Company and by its wholly owned subsidiaries, Investors Title Management Services, Inc. ITMS and Investors Trust Company Investors Trust ). 
 
 ITMS offers various consulting and management services to provide clients with the technical expertise to start and successfully operate a title insurance agency. 
 
 The Company s trust services division, Investors Trust, provides investment management and trust services to individuals, companies, banks and trusts. 

Business Trends and Recent Conditions 
 The housing market is heavily influenced by government policies and overall economic conditions. Regulatory reform and initiatives by various governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and other regulatory changes, could impact lending standards or the processes and procedures used by the Company. The current real estate environment, including interest rates and general economic activity, typically influence the demand for real estate. Changes in either of these areas, in addition to any inventory constraints or volatility in the cost and availability of building materials, could impact the Company's results of operations in future periods. 
 
 A recent period of inflation, as well as ongoing geopolitical and military conflicts, have created additional volatile market conditions and uncertainties in the global economy. These events have impacted and could continue to impact the Company in a number of ways including, but not limited to, future fluctuations in the Company's investment portfolio and potential decreases in net premiums written. The Federal Open Market Committee FOMC of the Federal Reserve has been highly attentive to the risks that these events have created, and in response adjusted the target federal funds rate at several meetings held during 2022 through 2024. Although the federal funds rate does not directly impact mortgage interest rates, it can have a significant influence as lenders pass on the costs of rate increases to consumers. Higher mortgage interest rates have impacted the demand and pricing of real estate. 
 
 Regulatory Environment 
 
 The FOMC issues disclosures on a periodic basis that include projections of the federal funds rate and expected actions. The FO MC maintained a target range between 0.00 and 0.25 from March 2020 until March 2022. Starting at the March 2022 meeting of the FOMC, the FOMC consistently raised the target federal funds rate range through July 2023, when the FOMC increased the target range to between 5.25 and 5.50 . At the September 2024 meeting of the FOMC, the FOMC lowered the target rate by 0.50 to a range between 4.75 and 5.00 . At the November 2024 meeting of the FOMC, the FOMC lowered the target rate by 0.25 to a range between 4.50 and 4.75 . In normal economic situations, future adjustments to the FOMC s stance of monetary policy are expected to be based on realized and expected economic developments to achieve maximum employment and inflation near the FOMC 's symmetric long-term 2.0 objective.

Real Estate Environment 
 
 The Mortgage Bankers Association's ("MBA") September 23, 2024 Mortgage Finance Forecast MBA Forecast projects 2024 purchase activity to increase 5.6 to 1,309 billion and mortgage refinance activity to increase 134.2 to 513 billion, resulting in a net increase in total mortgage originations of 25.0 to 1,822 billion, all from 2023 levels. In 2023, purchase activity accounted for 85.0 of all mortgage originations and is projected in the MBA Forecast to represent 71.8 of all mortgage originations in 2024. According to data published by Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rates in the United States were 6.8 and 6.6 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Per the MBA Forecast, mortgage interest rates are projected to decrease in subsequent periods, declining to 5.8 in 2026. Due to the rapidly changing environment brought on by inflationary pressures, inventory constraints, and geopolitical and military conflicts, these projections and the impact of actual future developments on the Company could be subject to material change. 
 
 Historically, activity in real estat e markets has varied over the course of market cycles by geographic region and in response to evolving economic factors. Operating results can vary from year to year based on cyclical market conditions and do not necessarily indicate the Company's future operating results and cash flows. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 
 The preparation of the Company's unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures regarding contingencies and commitments. Actual results could differ from these estimates. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not make any material changes to its critical accounting policies as previously disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis in the 2023 Form 10-K.

Results of Operations 
 
 The following table presents certain unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations data for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenues: Net premiums written 54,855 49,822 146,451 132,793 Escrow and other title-related fees 4,574 4,683 13,098 12,942 Non-title services 4,305 4,636 12,913 14,513 Interest and dividends 2,736 2,313 7,824 6,537 Other investment income 995 514 1,996 2,915 Net investment gains (losses) 976 (815) 4,640 720 Other 388 257 748 647 Total Revenues

Insurance Revenues 
 
 Insurance revenues include net premiums written and escrow and other title-related income that includes escrow fees, commissions and settlement fees. Non-title services revenue, investment-related revenues and other revenues are discussed separately below. 
 
 Net Premiums Written 
 
 Net premiums written increased 10.1 and 10.3 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 to 54.9 million and 146.5 million, respectively, compared with 49.8 million and 132.8 million for the same prior year periods. The increases for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to expansion efforts in the Company's Texas and Florida markets, in addition to appreciation in average home prices and higher activity levels for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 related to lower average mortgage interest rates. 
 
 Total premiums include an estimate of premiums for policies that have been issued directly and by agents, but not reported to the Company as of the balance sheet date. To determine the estimated premiums, the Company uses historical experience, as well as other factors, to make certain assumptions about the average elapsed time between the policy effective date and the date the policies are reported. From time to time, the Company adjusts the inputs to the estimation process as reported transactions and new information becomes available. In addition to estimating revenues, the Company also estimates and accrues agent commissions, claims provision, premium taxes, income taxes, and other expenses associated with the estimated revenues that have been accrued. The Company reflects any adjustments to the accruals in the results of operations in the period in which new information becomes available. 
 
 Title insurance companies typically issue title insurance policies directly or through title agencies. Following is a breakdown of premiums generated by direct and agency operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Direct 16,267 29.7 17,485 35.1 45,119 30.8 45,975 34.6 Agency 38,588 70.3 32,337 64.9 101,332 69.2 86,818 65.4 Total 54,855 100.0 49,822 100.0 146,451 100.0 132,793 100.0 
 
 Direct Net Premiums The Company's direct business consists of operations at the home office, branch offices, and wholly owned title insurance agencies. In the Company's direct operations, the Company issues a title insurance policy and retains the entire premium, as no commissions are recognized in connection with these policies. Net premiums written from direct operations decreased 7.0 and 1.9 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the same prior year periods. The decreases for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were primarily the result of the Company making the strategic decision to close less profitable offices of a wholly owned title insurance agency and lower activity levels in certain markets where the Company issues title insurance policies directly. 
 
 Agency Net Premiums When a policy is written through a non-wholly owned title agency, the premium is shared between the agency and the Company. The agent retains a majority of the premium as a commission and remits the net amount to the Company. Title insurance commissions earned by the Company s agents are recognized as expenses concurrently with premium recognition. Agency net premiums written increased 19.3 and 16.7 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same prior year periods. The increases for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to expansion efforts in the Company's Texas and Florida markets, in addition to appreciation in average home prices and higher activity levels for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 related to lower average mortgage interest rates. 
 29 

Following is a schedule of net premiums written for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in select states in which the Company's two insurance subsidiaries, ITIC and NITIC, currently underwrite title insurance: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, State (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 North Carolina 18,480 19,243 51,418 50,084 Texas 15,507 12,627 40,694 36,006 South Carolina 4,371 5,090 12,314 12,904 Florida 4,714 2,144 10,825 4,494 Georgia 3,857 3,169 10,620 9,347 All Others 8,052 7,630 20,658 20,253 Premiums Written 54,981 49,903 146,529 133,088 Reinsurance Assumed Reinsurance Ceded (126) (81) (78) (295) Net Premiums Written 54,855 49,822 146,451 132,793 
 
 Escrow and Other Titl e-Related Fees 
 
 Escrow and other title-related fees consists primarily of commission income, escrow and other various fees associated with the issuance of title insurance policies including settlement, examination and closing fees. Escrow and other title-related fee revenues remained relatively consistent with the prior year periods at 4.6 million and 13.1 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 4.7 million and 12.9 million for the same prior year periods. 

Revenue from Non-Title Services 
 
 Revenue from non-title services includes trust services, agency management services and exchange services income. Non-title service revenues were 4.3 million and 12.9 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 4.6 million and 14.5 million for the same prior year periods. The decreases for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were primarily related to decreases in like-kind exchange revenues. 

Investment-Related Revenues 
 
 Investment-related revenues include interest and dividends, other investment income, and net investment gains (losses). 
 
 Interest and Dividends 
 
 The Company derives a substantial portion of its income from investments in short-term investments, fixed maturity securities, which are primarily municipal and corporate fixed maturity securities, and equity securities. The Company s investment policy is designed to comply with regulatory requirements and to balance the competing objectives of asset quality and investment returns. The Company's title insurance subsidiaries are required by statute to maintain minimum levels of investments in order to protect the interests of policyholders. 
 
 The Company s investment strategy emphasizes after-tax income and principal preservation. The Company s investments are primarily in fixed maturity securities, short-term investments and equity securities. The average effective maturity of the majority of the fixed maturity securities at September 30, 2024 is less than 10 years. The Company s invested assets are managed to fund its obligations and evaluated to ensure long term stability of capital accounts. 
 
 30 

As the Company generates cash from operations, it is invested in accordance with the Company s investment policy and corporate goals. The Company s investment policy has been designed to balance multiple goals, including the assurance of a stable source of income from interest and dividends, the preservation of principal, and the provision of liquidity sufficient to meet insurance underwriting and other obligations as they become payable in the future. Securities purchased may include a combination of taxable or tax-exempt fixed maturity securities and equity securities. The Company also invests in short-term investments that typically include money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. The Company strives to maintain a high quality investment portfolio. 
 
 Interest and dividends were 2.7 million and 7.8 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 2.3 million and 6.5 million for the same prior year periods. Interest and dividend levels are primarily a function of general market performance, interest rates and the amount of cash available for investments that meet the Company's investment policy. The increases for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were primarily related to elevated levels of interest income, predominantly influenced by interest rates, general market performance, and the amount of investments and cash held. 
 
 Other Investment Income 
 
 Other investment income consists primarily of income related to investments in unconsolidated affiliates, typically structured as limited liability companies ("LLCs"), accounted for under either the equity method of accounting or the measurement alternative for investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. The measurement alternative method requires investments without readily determinable fair values to be recorded at cost, less impairments, and plus or minus any changes resulting from observable price changes. The Company monitors any events or changes in circumstances that may have had a significant adverse effect on the fair value of these investments and makes any necessary adjustments. 
 
 Other investment income was 995 thousand and 2.0 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 514 thousand and 2.9 million for the same prior year periods. Changes in other investment income are impacted by fluctuations in the carrying value of the underlying investment and distributions received. 
 
 Net Investment Gains (Losses) 
 
 Net investment gains and losses include realized gains and losses on the sale of investment securities and changes in the estimated fair value of equity security investments. 
 
 Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses Dispositions of equity securities at a realized gain or loss reflect such factors as industry sector allocation decisions, ongoing assessments of issuers business prospects and tax planning considerations. Additionally, the amounts included in net realized investment gains or losses are affected by assessments of securities valuation for impairment. As a result of the interaction of these factors and considerations, the net realized investment gain or loss can vary significantly from period to period. 
 
 The net realized investment gains were 235 thousand and 4.7 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 1.6 million and 14.7 million for the same prior year periods. The Company recorded impairment charges of 309 thousand and 383 thousand on certain fixed maturity securities and other investments where the intent to hold has changed in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 96 thousand and 208 thousand for the same prior year periods. Management believes unrealized losses on the remaining fixed maturity securities at September 30, 2024 are temporary in nature. 
 
 The securities in the Company s investment portfolio are subject to economic conditions and market risks. The Company considers relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest-related impairment of a fixed maturity security has occurred. Relevant facts and circumstances include the extent and length of time the fair value of an investment has been below cost. 
 
 There are a number of risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring impairments and determining if an impairment exists. These risks and uncertainties include the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated; the risk that the Company s assessment of an issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the characteristics of that issuer; the risk that information obtained by the Company or changes in other facts and circumstances leads management to change its intent to sell the fixed maturity security; and the risk that management is making decisions based on inaccurate information in the financial statements provided by the issuers. 
 
 31 

Changes in the Estimated Fair Value of Equity Security Investments Changes in the estimated fair value of equity security investments were 741 thousand and (18) thousand for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with (2.4) million and (14.0) million for the same prior year periods. Such fluctuations are typically the result of changes in general market conditions during the respective periods, however, the sale of appreciated investment securities can result in a reduction in unrealized gains as they are reclassified to net realized investment gains (losses), which is not indicative of a decline in estimated fair value. 

Other Revenues 
 
 Other revenues primarily include miscellaneous income and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets and real estate. Other revenues remained relatively consistent with the prior year periods at 388 thousand and 748 thousand for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 257 thousand and 647 thousand for the same prior year periods. 

Expenses 
 
 The Company's operating expenses consist primarily of commissions to agents, personnel expenses, office and technology expenses and the provision for claims. Operating expenses increased 8.4 and 5.3 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same prior year periods. The increases for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to increases in commissions to agents, partially offset by decreases in personnel expenses. 
 
 Following is a summary of the Company's operating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Inter-segment eliminations have been netted; therefore, the individual segment amounts will not agree to Note 4 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Title Insurance 54,380 95.0 50,198 95.1 150,370 94.6 143,016 94.7 Exchange Services 645 1.1 577 1.1 1,962 1.2 1,731 1.1 All Other 2,216 3.9 2,025 3.8 6,686 4.2 6,303 4.2 Total 57,241 100.0 52,800 100.0 159,018 100.0 151,050 100.0 
 
 On a combined basis, the after-tax profit margins were 13.5 and 12.1 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 11.5 and 9.3 for the same prior year periods. The increases for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to growth in net premiums written, decreases in personnel expenses and other Company expense reduction initiatives, and higher levels of earnings and gains on investments. The Company continually strives to enhance its competitive strengths and market position, including ongoing initiatives to manage its operating expenses. 
 
 Total Company 
 
 Personnel Expenses Personnel expenses include base salaries, benefits and payroll taxes, bonuses paid to employees and contract labor expenses. Personnel expenses were 18.1 million and 54.8 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 19.1 million and 58.5 million for the same prior year periods. On a consolidated basis, personnel expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 26.2 and 29.2 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 31.1 and 34.2 for the same prior year periods. The decreases in personnel expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to lower staffing levels and other impacts from Company expense reduction initiatives. 
 
 Office and Technology Expenses Office and technology expenses primarily include facilities expenses, software and hardware expenses, depreciation expense, telecommunications expenses, and business insurance. Office and technology expenses remained relatively consistent with the prior year periods at 4.4 million and 13.2 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 4.2 million and 13.1 million for the same prior year periods. 
 
 Other Expenses Other expenses primarily include business development expenses, premium-related taxes and licensing, professional services, title and service fees, amortization of intangible assets and other general expenses. Other expenses remained relatively consistent with the prior year periods at 4.0 million and 12.1 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 3.9 million and 11.8 million for the same prior year periods.

Title Insurance 
 
 Commissions to Agents Agent commissions represent the portion of premiums retained by agents pursuant to the terms of their respective agency contracts. Commissions to agents increased 22.2 and 18.5 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the same prior year periods. Commission expense as a percentage of net premiums written by agents was 75.4 and 74.5 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 73.6 and 73.4 for the same prior year periods. The changes in commission expense, and commission expense as a percentage of net premiums written, were commensurate with the increases in agent premium volume. Commission rates vary by market due to local practice, competition and state regulations. 
 
 Provision for Claims The provision for claims decreased 9.2 and 10.6 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the same prior year periods. The provision for claims as a percentage of net premiums written was 3.0 and 2.4 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 3.7 and 2.9 for the same prior year periods. The decreases in the provision for claims as a percentage of net premiums written for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to higher levels of favorable loss development and fewer incurred claims losses in the current year periods. 
 
 Title claims are typically reported and paid within the first several years of policy issuance. The provision for claims reflects actual payments of claims, net of recovery amounts, plus adjustments to the specific and incurred but not reported claims reserves, the latter of which are actuarially determined based on historical claims experience. Actual payments of claims, net of recoveries, were 3.6 million for both the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the total reserve for claims was 37.0 million. Of that total, approximately 2.7 million was reserved for specific claims, and approximately 34.3 million was reserved for claims for which the Company had no notice. Because of the uncertainty of future claims, changes in economic conditions and the fact that claims may not materialize for several years, reserve estimates are subject to variability. 
 
 Changes from prior periods in the expected liability for claims reflect the uncertainty of the claims environment, as well as the limited predictive power of historical data. The Company continually updates and refines its reserve estimates as current experience develops and credible data emerges. Such data includes payments on claims closed during the quarter, new details that emerge on open cases that cause claims adjusters to increase or decrease the case reserves, and the impact that these types of changes have on the Company s total loss provision. Adjustments may be required as new information develops, which often varies from past experience. 

Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes was 2.3 million and 5.9 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 1.5 million and 4.2 million for the same prior year periods. Income tax expense, including federal and state taxes, as a percentage of income before income taxes was 19.6 and 20.7 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with 17.7 and 20.8 for the same prior year periods. The effective income tax rates for both 2024 and 2023 differ from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21 primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income and state taxes. Tax-exempt income lowers the effective tax rate. 
 
 The Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with recognized impairments and unrecognized losses recorded through September 30, 2024 will be realized. However, this judgment could be impacted by further market fluctuations. 
 
 33 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company s material cash requirements include general operating expenses, contractual and other obligations for the future payment of title claims, employment agreements, lease agreements, income taxes, capital expenditures, dividends on its common stock and other contractual commitments for goods and services needed for operations. All other arrangements entered into by the Company are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Cash flows from operations have historically been the primary source of financing for expanding operations, whether through organic growth or outside investments. The Company believes its balances of cash, short-term investments and other readily marketable securities, along with cash flows generated by ongoing operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements over the next 12 months and thereafter, including the funding of operating activities and commitments for investing and financing activities. There are currently no known trends that the Company believes will materially impact the Company s capital resources, nor is the Company anticipating any material changes in the mix or relative cost of such resources except as otherwise disclosed in the Business Trends and Recent Conditions section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. 
 
 The Company evaluates nonorganic growth opportunities, such as mergers and acquisitions, from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Because of the episodic nature of these events, related incremental liquidity and capital resource needs can be difficult to predict. 
 
 The Company s operating results and cash flows are heavily dependent on the real estate market. The Company s business has certain fixed costs such as personnel; therefore, changes in the real estate market are monitored closely, and operating expenses such as staffing levels are managed and adjusted accordingly. The Company believes that its significant working capital position and management of operating expenses will aid its ability to manage cash resources through fluctuations in the real estate market. 
 
 Cash Flows Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities were 17.7 million and (6.7) million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities differ from net income due to adjustments for non-cash items, such as gains and losses on investments and property, the timing of disbursements for taxes, claims and other accrued liabilities, and collections or changes in receivables and other assets. 
 
 Cash flows from non-operating activities have historically consisted of purchases and proceeds from investing activities, the issuance of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash was used in investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with net cash being provided by investing activities in the prior year period. Net cash was used in financing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The Company maintains a high degree of liquidity within its investment portfolio in the form of cash, short-term investments and other readily marketable securities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of 25.5 million, short-term investments of 87.4 million, available-for-sale fixed maturity securities of 103.4 million and equity securities of 37.8 million. The net effect of all activities on total cash and cash equivalents was an increase of 1.4 million in 2024. 
 
 Capital Resources The amount of capital resources the Company maintains is influenced by state regulation, the need to maintain superior financial ratings from third-party rating agencies and other marketing and operational considerations. 
 
 The Company's significant sources of funds are dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries, primarily its two title insurance subsidiaries. Cash is received from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends and as reimbursements for operating and other administrative expenses that it incurs. The reimbursements are executed within the guidelines of management agreements between the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 
 The ability of the Company's title insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company is subject to state regulation from their respective states of domicile. Each state regulates the extent to which title underwriters can pay dividends or make distributions and requires prior regulatory approval of the payment of dividends and other intercompany transfers. The maximum dividend permitted by law is not necessarily indicative of an insurer s actual ability to pay dividends. Depending on regulatory conditions, the Company may in the future need to retain cash in its title insurance subsidiaries in order to maintain their statutory capital position. As of September 30, 2024, both ITIC and NITIC met the minimum capital, surplus and reserve requirements for each state in which they are licensed. 
 
 While state regulations and the need to cover risks may set a minimum level for capital requirements, other factors necessitate maintaining capital resources in excess of the required minimum amounts. For instance, the Company s capital resources help it maintain high ratings from insurance company rating agencies. Superior ratings strengthen the Company's ability to compete with larger, well known title insurers with national footprints. 
 
 34 

A strong financial position provides the necessary flexibility to fund potential acquisition activity, to invest in the Company's core business, and to minimize the financial impact of potential adverse developments. Adverse developments that generally require additional capital include adverse financial results, changes in statutory accounting requirements by regulators, reserve charges, investment losses or costs incurred to adapt to a changing regulatory environment, including costs related to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regulation of the real estate industry. 
 
 Due to the Company s historical ability to consistently generate positive cash flows from its consolidated operations and investment income, management believes that funds generated from operations will enable the Company to adequately meet its current operating needs for the foreseeable future. However, given inflationary pressures and geopolitical and military conflicts, there can be no assurance that future experience will be similar to historical experience, since it is influenced by such factors as the interest rate environment, real estate activity, the Company s claims-paying ability and its financial strength ratings. In addition to operational and investment considerations, taking advantage of opportunistic external growth opportunities may necessitate obtaining additional capital resources. The Company is carefully monitoring inflation, geopolitical and military conflicts, and other trends that could potentially result in material adverse liquidity changes, and will continually assess its capital allocation strategy, including decisions relating to payment of dividends, repurchasing the Company s common stock and/or conserving cash. 
 
 Purchase of Company Stock On November 9, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the purchase of an additional 163,335 shares pursuant to the Company s repurchase plan, such that there was authority remaining under the plan to purchase up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the plan immediately after this approval . Unless terminated earlier by resolution of the Board of Directors, the plan will expire when all shares authorized for purchase under the plan have been purchased. Pursuant to the Company s ongoing purchase program, the Company purchased 7,039 shares in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 7,000 shares in the corresponding period in 2023. The Company anticipates making further purchases under this plan from time to time in the future, depending on such factors as the prevailing market price of the Company s common stock, the Company s available cash and then existing alternative uses for such cash. 
 
 Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were approximately 6.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 . In 2024, the Company has plans for various capital improvement projects, including investment in a number of technology and system development initiatives and hardware purchases which are anticipated to be funded via cash flows from operations. All material anticipated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary depending on a number of factors. 
 
 Contractual Obligations - As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a claims reserve totaling 37.0 million. The amounts and timing of these obligations are estimated and not set contractually. Events such as fraud, defalcation, and multiple property title defects can substantially and unexpectedly cause increases in both the amount and timing of estimated title insurance loss payments and loss cost trends whereby increases or decreases in inflationary factors (including the value of real estate) will influence the ultimate amount of title insurance loss payments and could increase total obligations and influence claim payout patterns. Due to the length of time over which claim payments are made and regularly occurring changes in underlying economic and market conditions, claim estimates are subject to variability and future payments could increase or decrease from these estimated amounts in the future. 
 
 ITIC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has entered into employment agreements with certain executive officers. The amounts accrued for these agreements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were 15.3 million and 15.2 million, respectively, which includes postretirement compensation and health benefits, and were calculated based on the terms of the contracts. These executive contracts are accounted for on an individual contract basis. As payments are based upon the occurrence of specific events, including death, disability, retirement, termination without cause or upon a change in control, payment periods are currently uncertain. Information regarding retirement agreements and other postretirement benefit plans can be found in Note 5 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 The Company enters into lease agreements that are primarily used for office space. These leases are accounted for as operating leases, with lease expense recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company occasionally assumes equipment lease agreements through business acquisitions. These leases are accounted for as finance leases. Included in a portion of the Company's current leases is an option to extend or cancel the lease term, and the exercise of such an option is solely at the Company's discretion. The total of undiscounted future minimum lease payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year after 2024 is 3.8 million, which includes lease payments related to options to extend or cancel the lease term if the Company determined at the date of adoption that the lease was expected to be renewed or extended. Information about leases can be found in Note 12 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into other contractual commitments for goods and services needed for operations. Such commitments are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s liquidity. 
 
 35 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As a service to its customers, the Company, through ITIC, administers escrow and trust deposits representing earnest money received under real estate contracts, undisbursed amounts received for settlement of mortgage loans and indemnities against specific title risks. These amounts are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are excluded from the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, the Company remains contingently liable for the disposition of these deposits. 
 
 In addition, in administering tax-deferred like-kind exchanges pursuant to 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, ITEC serves as a qualified intermediary for exchanges, holding the net sales proceeds from relinquished property to be used for purchase of replacement property. ITAC serves as exchange accommodation titleholder and, through LLCs that are wholly owned subsidiaries of ITAC, holds property for exchangers in reverse exchange transactions. Like-kind exchange deposits and reverse exchange property held by the Company for the purpose of completing such transactions totaled approximately 264.2 million and 263.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These exchange deposits are held at third-party financial institutions. Exchange deposits are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are excluded from the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets; however, the Company remains contingently liable for the disposition of the transfers of property, disbursements of proceeds and the return on the proceeds at the agreed upon rate. Exchange services revenue includes earnings on these deposits; therefore, investment income is shown as non-title services rather than investment income. These like-kind exchange funds are primarily invested in money market funds and other short-term investments. 
 
 External assets under management of Investors Trust Company are not considered assets of the Company and, therefore, are excluded from the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 It is not the general practice of the Company to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements or issue guarantees to third parties. The Company does not have any material source of liquidity or financing that involves off-balance sheet arrangements. Other than items noted above, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments due under various agreements with third-party service providers. 

Recent Accounting Standards 
 
 No recent accounting pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations. Please refer to Note 1 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding the Company s basis of presentation and significant accounting policies.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Item not required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 No system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the system of controls has operated effectively in all cases. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures, however, are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. 
 
 Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.
