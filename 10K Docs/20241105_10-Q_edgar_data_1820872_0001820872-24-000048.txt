The portion of income or loss attributable to third-party owners for the reporting period is reported as net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company has eliminated intercompany transactions and balances in its consolidated financial statements. 
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP for interim financial reporting. As such, certain notes or other information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP have been omitted if they substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the Company s annual audited consolidated financial statements. These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, United States (the SEC on March 13, 2024 (the Annual Report on Form 10-K ).

Accelerated amortization is recognized from the date that the Company approves the plan to fully or partially vacate a facility, for which there is no intent or ability to enter into a sublease, through the final vacate date.

Earnout shares will be included in weighted-average shares outstanding to calculate basic earnings (loss) per share as of the date their stock price thresholds are met and they are no longer subject to forfeiture. Additionally, dividends accrued on earnout shares, if any, will be forfeited if the pricing thresholds for earnout shares are not met during the specified time period.

 . In February 2023, the Company entered into another interest rate swap contract for a notional amount of million and maturity in March 2027. The terms of the agreement required the Company to receive a variable rate of three months SOFR, with a floor of , and pay fixed rate of . These interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges that were highly effective at offsetting the increases in cash outflows resulting from increased variable rates over the fixed rates under the swap contracts. The Company terminated both the interest rate swap contracts in September 2024 and made a payment to the counter-party of million, in cash, representing the fair value of the contracts on the termination date. 
 September 2024 to July 2028 September 2024 to July 2029 
 Under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , the fair value loss of the terminated interest rate swaps of million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be proportionately included as interest expense, in the consolidated statement of operations until March 2027 as the interest payments are made over this period. Further, the Company has determined that the new interest rate swap contracts will be designated as cash flow hedges that are highly effective at offsetting the increases in cash outflows when three-month SOFR exceeds respective fixed rates under the contracts. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps, net of tax, are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and into interest expense when the hedged interest obligations affect earnings. 
 Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps and Net Investment Hedges 
 
 In August 2024, the Company entered into a fixed-to-fixed cross currency interest rate swap ("CCS") contract. Under the CCS, the Company will receive fixed interest at per annum on a USD notional amount of million and will pay fixed interest of per annum on Euro ("EUR") notional amount of million. Notional amounts in the respective currencies are deemed to be exchanged at the beginning and end of the swap period. The swaps maturity date is July 26, 2029. Interest settlements under the CCS occur semi-annually in January and July of each year, commencing on January 26, 2025, and ending on July 26, 2029. 
 
 The Company has designated these CCS contracts as a net investment hedge, hedging foreign exchange translation risk related to a portion of its investments in EUR functional currency denominated subsidiaries on an after-tax basis. The Company has elected the spot method for measuring hedge effectiveness. As a result, the change in the fair value of CCS attributable to the changes in the spot rates are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) section of other comprehensive income (loss). The initial value of the excluded components are recognized in interest expense under a systematic and rational method in accordance with ASC 815. Any difference between the change in fair value of the excluded components and the amounts recognized in earnings under the swap accrual process are also reported in the CTA section of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts related to the CCS representing net periodic interest accruals are recognized in Interest expenses, on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 
 Earnout Shares 
 The Company has issued and outstanding earnout shares (see note 10 Earnout Shares which are accounted for as derivative instruments. As of September 30, 2024, the total number of earnout shares issued and outstanding were approximately million.

The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the earnout shares.

The discussion and analysis below presents our historical results as of and for the periods ended on, the dates indicated. 
 
 Overview 
 We operate American Express Global Business Travel, a leading software and services company for travel, expense and meetings events. We provide a full suite of differentiated, technology-enabled solutions to business travelers and business clients, suppliers of travel content (such as airlines, hotels, ground transportation providers and aggregators) and third-party travel agencies. We differentiate our value proposition through our commitment to deliver unrivaled choice, value and experience, and our brand promise. 
 
 We service our clients in the following ways: 
 
 The Amex GBT Marketplace is our proprietary capability to provide travel suppliers with efficient access to business travel clients serviced by our diverse portfolio of leading travel management solutions and Network Partners (defined below). We believe this access allows travel suppliers to benefit from premium demand (which we generally view as demand that is differentially valuable and profitable to suppliers) without incurring the costs associated with directly marketing to, and servicing the complex needs of, our business clients. Our travel supplier relationships generate efficiencies and cost savings that can be passed on to our business clients, delivering access to extensive and competitive content including exclusive negotiated content. 
 
 Our award-winning client facing travel and expense solutions are built to deliver business value through optimized user experiences across business travel and are comprised of Neo1, Egencia, Select, Neo and Ovation. These solutions are accessible over web and mobile interfaces, powered by our data management infrastructure and built by our dedicated product engineering team who is committed to driving technical innovation across the business travel industry. 
 
 GBT Partner Solutions is our program whereby we extend our platform to third-party travel management companies and independent advisors (collectively, "Network Partners"), by offering them access to our differentiated content and technology, global servicing capabilities and leading content marketplace ("GBT Partner Solutions"). Through GBT Partner Solutions, we aggregate business travel demand serviced by our Network Partners at low incremental cost, which we believe enhances the economics of our platform, generates increased return on investment and expands our geographic and segment footprint. 
 Potential Acquisition of CWT 
 On March 24, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with CWT Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company CWT ). See note 1 - Business Description and Basis of Presentation to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 The transaction values CWT at approximately 570 million on a cash-free and debt-free basis, subject to certain assumptions and purchase price adjustments. At the closing of the transaction, we expect to fund the acquisition with a combination of cash and an aggregate of approximately 72 million shares of our Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, at a price of 6.00 per share as purchase consideration. 
 The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.

 Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 As a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations are not comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors impacting the comparability of our results of operations. 
 Industry Trends 
 The travel industry can generally be divided into two sectors: (i) the leisure travel sector, which serves individuals who make reservations for vacation and personal travel, and (ii) the business travel sector, which serves business clients that require travel by employees and other travelers for business needs and meetings. We focus primarily on the business travel sector, which is approximately twice as valuable as the leisure travel sector because business travel customers purchase more premium seats, more flexible tickets, more long-haul international trips and more last-minute bookings. 
 
 Key Operating and Financial Metrics 
 We monitor the following key operating and financial metrics to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. The following key operating and financial metrics, which we believe are useful in evaluating our business, are used by management to monitor and analyze the operational and financial performance of our business:

 Key Operating Metrics 
 We consider Total Transaction Value TTV (as defined below), followed by Transaction Growth (Decline) (as defined below), to be two significant non-financial metrics that are broadly used in the travel industry to help understand 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 revenue and expense trends. These metrics are used by our management to (1) manage the financial planning and performance of our business, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, (3) make budgeting decisions, and (4) compare our performance to the performance of our peer companies. We also believe that TTV, followed by Transaction Growth (Decline), may assist potential investors and financial analysts in understanding the drivers of growth in our revenues and changes in our operating expenses across reporting periods. 
 TTV 
 TTV refers to the sum of the total price paid by travelers for air, hotel, rail, car rental and cruise bookings, including taxes and other charges applied by suppliers at point of sale, less cancellations and refunds. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, TTV increased by 629 million, or 9 , to 7,752 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 TTV increased by 1,687 million, or 8 , to 23,581 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in TTV during these periods was primarily due to Transaction Growth and an increase in average transaction price driven by a higher mix in international transactions and higher hotel room rates. 
 Transaction Growth (Decline) 
 Transaction Growth (Decline) represents year-over-year increase or decrease as a percentage of the total transactions, including air, hotel, car rental, rail or other travel-related transactions, recorded at the time of booking, and is calculated on a net basis to exclude cancellations, refunds and exchanges. To calculate year-over-year growth or decline, we compare the total number of net transactions in the comparative previous period/ year to the total number of net transactions in the current period/year in percentage terms. During 2024, we have amended our definition of Transaction Growth (Decline) and, we have presented Transaction Growth (Decline) on a net basis to exclude cancellations, refunds and exchanges as management believes this better aligns Transaction Growth (Decline) with the way we measure TTV and revenue. Prior period Transaction Growth percentages have been recalculated and represented to conform to current period presentation. 
 
 Transaction Growth was 5 for the three months and nine months period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the respective prior year period. Increase in Transaction Growth during both periods was primarily due to share gains and increased demand for business travel from our clients, with strong global multinational customer base performance offset by slower growth in small and medium enterprise customer base. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition, and should not be considered as an alternative, to other performance or liquidity measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company. 
 Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with useful supplemental information that enables a better comparison of our performance or liquidity across periods. In addition, we use certain of these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures as they are important metrics used by management to evaluate and understand the underlying operations and business trends, forecast future results and determine future capital investment allocations. We also use certain of our non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of our ability to generate cash to meet our liquidity needs and to assist our management in evaluating our financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement comparable GAAP measures in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and/or to compare our performance and liquidity against that of other peer companies using similar measures. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Operating Expenses 
 We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, benefit from (provision for) income taxes and depreciation and amortization.

Table of Contents 

 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, benefit from (provision for) income taxes and depreciation and amortization and as further adjusted to exclude costs that management believes are non-core to the underlying business of the Company, consisting of restructuring, exit and related charges, integration costs, costs related to mergers and acquisitions, non-cash equity-based compensation and related employer taxes, long-term incentive plan costs, certain corporate costs, fair value movements on earnout derivative liabilities, foreign currency gains (losses), non-service components of net periodic pension benefit (costs) and gains (losses) on disposal of businesses. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. 
 We define Adjusted Operating Expenses as total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and costs that management believes are non-core to the underlying business of the Company, consisting of restructuring, exit and related charges, integration costs, costs related to mergers and acquisitions, non-cash equity-based compensation and related employer taxes, long-term incentive plan costs and certain corporate costs. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Operating Expenses are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or total operating expenses, as determined under GAAP. In addition, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company s results or expenses as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are that these measures do not reflect: 
 changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments; 
 our interest expense, or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; 
 our tax expense, or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; 
 recurring, non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future; 
 the non-cash expense of stock-based compensation, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, an important part of how we attract and retain our employees and a significant recurring expense in our business; 
 restructuring, mergers and acquisition and integration costs, all of which are intrinsic to our acquisitive business model; and 
 impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that are non-core to our underlying business, as we believe they are not indicative of our underlying operations. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Operating Expenses should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as a measure determining discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. 
 We believe that the adjustments applied in presenting EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Operating Expenses are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash and other items that management believes are non-core to our underlying business. 
 We use these measures as performance measures as they are important metrics used by management to evaluate and understand the underlying operations and business trends, forecast future results and determine future capital investment allocations. These non-GAAP measures supplement comparable GAAP measures in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.

 refinancing of term loans in July 2024 with lower fixed rate margins. The changes in variable interest rates did not have material impact due to interest rate swaps being in place. 
 Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

 Fair Value Movements on Earnout Derivative Liabilities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value movement of our derivative liabilities related to our earnout shares resulted in a charge of 14 million to our consolidated statements of operations compared to a credit of 23 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in fair value of earnout derivative liability was mainly driven by the increase in our stock price as of September 30, 2024. 
 Other Loss, net 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other loss, net, remained stable and comprised of 5 million of foreign exchange loss and 4 million of non-service components of our net periodic pension cost related to our defined benefit pension plans. 
 (Provision for) Benefit from Income Taxes 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had income tax (expense) benefit of (55) million and 12 million, respectively. Our effective tax rate is different than the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 21 due to changes to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, non-deductible expenses and certain U.S minimum taxes. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to meet our cash needs in the short-term. Over the long-term, we manage our cash and capital structure with an intention to maintain our financial condition and flexibility for future strategic initiatives. Our principal sources of liquidity are typically cash flows generated from operations, cash available under the credit facilities as well as cash and cash equivalent balances on hand. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalent balances were 524 million and 476 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net cash from operating activities was 207 million and 104 million, respectively, and our Free Cash Flow was 132 million and 17 million, respectively (See Free Cash Flow for additional information about this non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP). On July 26, 2024, we amended and restated the Original Credit Agreement, which increased our revolving credit facility from 50 million to 360 million all of which remains undrawn as of September 30, 2024 (see note 7 - Long-term Debt, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q). 
 We believe our liquidity is important given our limited ability to predict future financial performance due to the uncertainties of a potential economic slowdown. We have taken and continue to take several measures to preserve our liquidity (voluntary and involuntary redundancies, flexible workings, consolidating facilities, etc.), and entered into several financial transactions, including debt financing / refinancing transactions. In July 2024, we refinanced our then existing term loan facility and extended the maturity of term loans until July 2031 (see note 7 - Long-term Debt to our consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q). We continue to explore other capital market transactions, process rationalizations and cost reduction measures to further strengthen our liquidity position. 
 Based on our current operating plan, existing cash and cash equivalents, increase in business volume trends, mitigation measures taken or planned to strengthen our liquidity and financial position, along with our available increased revolving credit funding capacity under the A R Credit Agreement and cash flows from operations, we believe we have adequate liquidity to meet the future operating, investing and financing needs of the business for a minimum period of twelve months. Although we believe that we will have a sufficient level of cash and cash equivalents to cover our working capital needs in the ordinary course of business and to continue to expand our business, we may, from time to time, explore additional financing sources to lower our cost of capital, which could include equity, equity-linked and debt financing.

 addition, from time to time, we may evaluate acquisitions and other strategic opportunities or undertake transactions to increase shareholder value. If we elect to pursue any such investments or transactions, we may fund them with internally generated funds, bank financing, the issuance of other debt or equity or a combination thereof. There is no assurance that such funding would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our full utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility, under the A R Credit Agreement entered into in July 2024, may be effectively limited with the leverage-based financial covenant requirements.

 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 550 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, an increase of 61 million compared to December 31, 2023. The following discussion summarizes changes to our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, net cash from operating activities was 207 million and 104 million, respectively. The increase in cash flows from operating activities of 103 million was primarily due to an increase in operating income and lower cash interest payments partially offset by higher cash income taxes. 
 Investing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities decreased by 23 million primarily due to (i) decrease in purchase of property and equipment of 12 million and (ii) 10 million resulting from proceeds received in 2024 for a loan given to an equity affiliate in 2023 . 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities of 79 million was primarily due to: (i) 1,372 million of repayment of principal amount of term loans under the Original Credit Agreement upon refinancing of debt in July 2024 (ii) 55 million purchase of treasury shares (iii) 51 million related to debt refinancing costs and make-whole premium for early repayment of term loans and (iv) 22 million cash paid for taxes withheld upon vesting of equity awards, offset by (v) 1,397 million of proceeds from borrowings under the A R Credit Agreement, net of discount, upon debt refinancing in July 2024 and (vi) 27 million cash received from contributions for ESPP and exercise of stock options. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash from financing activities of 121 million was primarily due to: (i) 131 million of proceeds received from borrowings under the senior secured tranche B-4 term loan facilities, net of discount and (ii) 7 million received from exercise of stock options and contributions to ESPP, partially offset by (iii) 4 million repayment of principal amount of senior secured term loans and finance leases, and (iv) 14 million cash paid for taxes withheld upon vesting / exercise of equity awards.

 Free Cash Flow 
 We define Free Cash Flow as net cash from (used in) operating activities, less cash used for additions to property and equipment. 
 We believe Free Cash Flow is an important measure of our liquidity. This measure is a useful indicator of our ability to generate cash to meet our liquidity demands. We use this measure to conduct and evaluate our operating liquidity. We believe it typically presents an alternate measure of cash flow since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of our ongoing operations and it provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our platform. We believe Free Cash Flow provides investors with an understanding of how assets are performing and measures management s effectiveness in managing cash. 
 Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. This measure has limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent cash flow for discretionary expenditures. This measure should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. This measure is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. 
 Set forth below is a reconciliation of net cash from operating activities to Free Cash Flow. 
 Nine months ended September 30, Change 
 increase/(decrease)

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Free Cash Flow improvement of 115 million was due to a 103 million increase in net cash from operating activities as discussed above and a decrease of 12 million of cash outflows related to purchases of property and equipment.

 We define Net Debt as total debt outstanding consisting of the current and non-current portion of long-term debt, net of unamortized debt discount and unamortized debt issuance costs, minus cash and cash equivalents. Net Debt is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. This measure is not a measurement of our indebtedness as determined under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to assess our total debt or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to total debt. Management uses Net Debt to review our overall liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage. Further, we believe that certain debt rating agencies, creditors and credit analysts monitor our Net Debt as part of their assessment of our business. 
 The following table summarizes our Net Debt position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Current portion of long-term debt 16 7 Long-term debt, net of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs 1,368 1,355 Total debt, net of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs 1,384 1,362 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (524) (476) Net Debt 860 886 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, our Net Debt is lower by 26 million compared to Net Debt as of December 31, 2023, due to 48 million increase in cash and cash equivalents balance, offset by 22 million of net increase in total debt, net of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs, primarily resulting from refinanced term loans as discussed below. 
 On July 26, 2024, we amended and restate our senior secured credit facility, and borrowed an aggregate principal amount of 1,400 million of term loans. The proceeds therefrom were used, in part, to repay in full the loans and other outstanding obligations (including make-whole premium, related fees and expenses) under the Original Credit Agreement. See note 7 - Long-term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 Debt Covenants 
 Our senior secured credit facility agreement contains customary restrictive financial and operating covenants (see note 7 - Long-term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q). 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the senior secured credit agreement. 
 Debt Ratings 
 
 The Company s borrowings under the A R Credit Agreement was rated B+ by Standard Poor s Financial Services LLC ("S P") with "Positive" outlook. We also received a "B2" rating from Moody's Corporation ("Moody's") and "BBB-" rating from Fitch Ratings Inc. 
 
 Under the A R Credit Agreement, we are required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a fee based on the average daily commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility of 0.375 per annum, with a single step-down to 0.25 per annum upon an upgrade of the Initial Borrower s debt rating from either S P or Moody s on or prior to the first anniversary of the closing of the previously announced acquisition of CWT. Our debt ratings have a direct impact on our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 In October 2024, our Board of Directors authorized our management to repurchase shares of the Company s Class A common stock through December 31, 2027 in an amount not to exceed 300 million. Under the share repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase, on a discretionary basis and from time-to-time, outstanding shares of our Class A common stock by means of open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions and/or by other means deemed appropriate or advisable by our management. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be subject to our discretion and depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our Class A common stock, general market and economic conditions, regulatory requirements and other business considerations. The share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of our Class A common stock under the program. 
 
 As of November 1, 2024, no shares have been repurchased under the share repurchase program and 300 million remains available to be utilized under the share repurchase program. The share repurchase transaction that we entered into in August 2024, was not part of this share repurchase program, and was a separately negotiated transaction with a shareholder (see Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds ). 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 On July 26, 2024, we entered into the A R Credit Agreement under which we borrowed 1,400 million of term loans and which provides for a 360 million of revolving credit facility. The proceeds from the term loans were used to repay, in full, the principal amount of term loans and other outstanding obligation (including breakage fees and related transaction fees and expenses) under the Original Credit Agreement. The principal amount outstanding under the new term loan facility is required to be repaid on a quarterly basis, commencing March 31, 2025, at an amortization rate of 1.00 per annum, with the balance due at maturity on July 26, 2031. There were no amounts drawn down from the revolving credit facility. (see note 7 - Long-term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q). 
 Other than as discussed above, there has been no material change to our contractual obligations and commitments as compared to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Table of Contents 

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. There are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and (ii) changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, adopted and not yet adopted by us, see note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and inflation. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into derivative financial instruments for a portion of principal amount of our term loans and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates risk through internally established policies and procedures. The objective of our policy is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow, and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in rates. We do not engage in trading, market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets to manage these risks. 
 
 In order to mitigate a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the value of our investments in foreign subsidiaries denominated in the euro, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap contract and designated it as a net investment hedge (see note 14 - Derivatives and Hedging and note 15 - Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further information). Any change in the fair value of the net investment hedge would be more than offset by a change in the value of our investments in certain of our European subsidiaries. Additionally, during times of a strengthening United States dollar against the euro, we would be required to use a lower amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest on our term loans and to settle our cross-currency interest rate swap contract, whereas during times of a weakening United States dollar against the euro, we would be required to use a greater amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest on our term loans and to settle our cross-currency interest rate swap contract. 
 Further, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and following debt refinancing in July 2024, we terminated our previous interest rate swap contracts and made a payment to the counter-party of 4 million, in cash, representing the fair value of the contracts on the termination date. The Company simultaneously entered into two new interest rate swap agreements (see note 14 - Derivatives and Hedging and note 15 - Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further information). 
 Other than above, there were no material changes in either our market risks or our mitigating strategies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the information provided in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, management has concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 
 Due to the material weakness described below, management completed additional procedures prior to filing this Quarterly Report. Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have certified that, based on such officers' knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Quarterly Report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Quarterly Report . 
 
 As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company identified deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting related to the Egencia business, which we acquired on November 1, 2021. Certain revenue and procurement processes and procedures of the Egencia business, which was owned by Expedia prior to our acquisition, were carried out by Expedia under the transition services agreement. The Company had lack of oversight of these outsourced revenue and procurement processes and related controls, including general information technology ("IT") controls and IT application controls, that are used in the preparation of Egencia s financial results. As a result, management has concluded the lack of oversight of such outsourced processes and controls is a material weakness as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weakness 
 
 Our material weakness is related to the processes of recording of client revenue and payment of certain vendors of Egencia business and Egencia client receivables. We are currently working to remediate the material weakness, including assessing the need for additional remediation steps and implementing additional measures to remediate the underlying causes that gave rise to the material weakness. We expect to achieve remediation through the integration of key applications and processes for the Egencia business into the Company s legacy control environment. The integration of the Egencia key applications and processes into the Company s existing applications and processes has been completed and is now subject to the Company's internal control procedures and testing. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 Other than with respect to the ongoing remediation efforts on Egencia's client revenue process and payment of vendor process, including related general IT controls and IT application controls, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitation on Controls 
 Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and fraud due to inherent limitations of internal control. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION. 
 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Management believes that we do not have any pending litigation that, separately or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the risk factors presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item IA. Risk Factors, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024 ("First Quarter Form 10-Q") and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2024 ("Second Quarter Form 10-Q"), under Part II, Item IA . Risk Factors except as set forth below. For further discussion of other risk factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations, refer to the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, First Quarter Form 10-Q and Second Quarter Form 10-Q. These are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. 
 Interruptions in and unauthorized access to our information technology systems, security breaches or incidents impacting our systems or data that we or our service providers maintain or otherwise process, could adversely affect our business. 
 Cyber-attacks are increasing in number and sophistication, are well-financed, in some cases supported by nation-state actors, and are designed to not only attack, but also to evade detection. Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems, or to otherwise sabotage them, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate detection or preventative measures. The emergence and maturation of artificial intelligence capabilities has led to new and/or more sophisticated methods of attack, including fraud that relies upon deep fake impersonation technology, of which we have been a target, or other forms of generative automation that have scaled up the effectiveness of cyber threat activity. 
 We develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing data breaches and fraudulent activity, which require significant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of data breaches, malicious social engineering and fraudulent or other malicious activities, deep fake attacks and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain, including the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information (including account data information), online accounts and systems. 
 If our information technology systems experience a significant disruption or breach or if actual or perceived fraud levels or other illegal activities were to arise due to a data breach at a business partner, merchant or other market participant, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, it could lead to the loss of data or data integrity, regulatory investigations, increased litigation (including class action litigation), remediation and response costs, greater concerns of customers and/or business partners relating to the privacy and security of their data, and reputational and financial damage to our brand, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. If such disruptions or breaches are not detected immediately, their effect and resulting impact could be compounded. Data breaches and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or data protection, including leaked business data, may also disrupt our operations, undermine our competitive advantage through the disclosure of sensitive Company information, divert management attention and resources and negatively impact the assessment of us and our subsidiaries by regulatory authorities and rating agencies.
