 September 30, 2024 , respectively.

 investment does not have a readily determinable fair value, the Company has elected to measure this investment at its cost 
 minus impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical 
 or similar investments in the private corporation.

 disclosed at fair value. The carrying amount of Cash and cash equivalents, Receivables, Payables and accrued liabilities, and 
 certain Other liabilities approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the 
 credit facilities (as defined in Note 7) approximates fair value because the credit facilities have variable interest based on

 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a million expense to reduce the carrying value of an Affiliate to 
 fair value. The decline in the fair value was a result of an anticipated decline in assets under management, which decreased the

 The Company periodically purchases Affiliate equity from and issues Affiliate equity to the Company s consolidated 
 Affiliate partners and other parties under agreements that provide the Company a conditional right to call and Affiliate equity 
 holders the conditional right to put their Affiliate equity interests to the Company at certain intervals. The Company has the 
 right to settle a portion of these purchases in shares of its common stock. For Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, 
 the Company does not typically have such put and call arrangements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 
 2024 , the amount of cash paid for purchases was million and million , respectively. For the nine months ended

 Sales and purchases of Affiliate equity generally occur at fair value; however, the Company also grants Affiliate equity to 
 its consolidated Affiliate partners and other parties as a form of compensation. If the equity is issued for consideration below 
 the fair value of the equity, or purchased for consideration above the fair value of the equity, the difference is recorded as 
 compensation expense in Compensation and related expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the requisite

 Effects of Changes in the Company s Ownership in Affiliates 
 The Company periodically acquires interests from, and transfers interests to, Affiliate equity holders. Because these 
 transactions do not result in a change of control, any gain or loss related to these transactions is recorded to Additional paid-in 
 capital, which increases or decreases the controlling interest s equity. No gain or loss related to these transactions is recorded in 
 the Consolidated Statements of Income or the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

 The Company s effective tax rate (controlling interest) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was higher than the 
 marginal tax rate of 24.5 , primarily due to the increase in the UK corporate tax rate in 2023. The Company s effective tax 
 rate (controlling interest) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the marginal tax rate primarily due to 
 discrete foreign tax benefits and tax windfalls attributable to share-based compensation. 
 The Company s effective tax rate (controlling interest) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the 
 marginal tax rate of 24.5 , primarily due to tax windfalls attributable to share-based compensation. The Company s effective 
 tax rate (controlling interest) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the marginal tax rate of 24.5 , 
 primarily due to an expense to reduce the carrying value of an Affiliate to fair value for which no tax benefit was recorded. 
 The Company s effective tax rate reflects the relative contributions of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the Company 
 and its Affiliates operate and is impacted by changes in the jurisdictional mix of income before taxes. 
 The Company continues to monitor and evaluate legislative developments related to the Organization for Economic Co- 
 operation and Development s Pillar Two directive Pillar Two ), which establishes a framework for a global minimum 
 corporate tax rate of 15 . Several countries in which the Company or its Affiliates operate have adopted legislation to 
 implement Pillar Two and several others are expected to enact similar rules in the future. The Company currently does not 
 expect Pillar Two to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange 
 Commission, in our press releases, and in oral statements made with the approval of an executive officer may constitute 
 forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements 
 include, but are not limited to, statements related to our expectations regarding the performance of our business, our financial 
 results, our liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements, and may be prefaced with words such as 
 outlook, guidance, believes, expects, potential, preliminary, continues, may, will, should, seeks, 
 approximately, predicts, projects, positioned, prospects, intends, plans, estimates, pending 
 investments, anticipates, or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. Such statements are subject to 
 certain risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the factors discussed under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 
 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and from time to time, as applicable, our Quarterly 
 Reports on Form 10-Q . These factors (among others) could affect our financial condition, business activities, results of 
 operations, cash flows, or overall financial performance and cause actual results and business activities to differ materially 
 from historical periods and those presently anticipated and projected. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date 
 they are made, and we will not undertake and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the result of any 
 revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such 
 statements or to reflect the occurrence of events, whether or not anticipated. In that respect, we caution readers not to place 
 undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction 
 with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 References throughout this report to AMG, we, us, our, the Company, and similar references refer to 
 Affiliated Managers Group, Inc., unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires. 
 
 Executive Overview 
 AMG is a strategic partner to leading independent investment firms globally. Our strategy is to generate long-term value 
 by investing in a diverse array of high-quality independent partner-owned firms, referred to as Affiliates, through a proven 
 partnership approach, and allocating resources across our unique opportunity set to the areas of highest growth and return. 
 With their entrepreneurial, investment-centric cultures and alignment of interests with clients through direct equity ownership 
 by firm principals, independent firms have fundamental competitive advantages in offering unique return streams to the 
 marketplace. Through AMG s distinctive approach, we enhance these advantages to magnify the long-term success of our 
 Affiliates and actively support their independence. Our innovative model enables each Affiliate s management team to retain 
 autonomy and significant equity ownership in their firm, while they leverage our strategic capabilities and insight, including 
 growth capital, product strategy and development, capital formation, and incentive alignment and succession planning. As of 
 September 30, 2024 , our aggregate assets under management were approximately 728 billion across a diverse range of 
 private markets, liquid alternatives, and differentiated long-only investment strategies. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we completed our minority investment in Suma Capital Suma ), a pan-European private 
 markets firm that invests in the transition to a lower carbon economy. Following the close of the transaction, Suma partners 
 continue to hold a significant majority of the equity of the firm and direct its day-to-day operations. 
 
 Operating Performance Measures 
 Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP ), we are required to consolidate certain of our 
 Affiliates and use the equity method of accounting for others. Whether we consolidate an Affiliate or use the equity method of 
 accounting, we maintain the same innovative partnership approach and provide support and assistance in substantially the same 
 manner for all of our Affiliates. Furthermore, all of our Affiliates are investment managers and are impacted by similar 
 marketplace factors and industry trends. Therefore, our key aggregate operating performance measures are important in 
 providing management with a comprehensive view of the operating performance and material trends across our entire business.

Assets under management, and therefore average assets under management, include the assets under management of our 
 consolidated and equity method Affiliates. Assets under management is presented on a current basis without regard to the 
 timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate s financial results in our operating performance measures and Consolidated Financial 
 Statements. Average assets under management reflects the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate s financial results in our 
 operating performance measures and Consolidated Financial Statements. Average assets under management for mutual funds 
 and similar investment products generally represents an average of the daily net assets under management, while for 
 institutional and high net worth clients, average assets under management generally represents an average of the assets at the 
 beginning or end of each month during the applicable period. 
 Aggregate fees consist of the total asset- and performance-based fees earned by all of our consolidated and equity method 
 Affiliates. For certain of our Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, we report the Affiliate s aggregate fees one 
 quarter in arrears. Aggregate fees are provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Consolidated revenue or other GAAP 
 performance measures. 
 
 Assets Under Management 
 Our Affiliates provide a diverse range of differentiated return streams through their specialized investment processes. We 
 continue to see client demand for alternative strategies, as evidenced by our net inflows in this category for the three and nine 
 months ended September 30, 2024 . At the same time, our equity strategies saw outflows in line with client cash flow trends 
 across the industry. We continue to invest our capital and resources in areas aligned with long-term client demand trends, most 
 notably in private markets and liquid alternatives . As we continue to invest in new and existing Affiliates, we expect to further 
 evolve our business mix and better position AMG to benefit from industry growth trends. We also anticipate that independent 
 investment firms will continue to seek access to an evolving range of partnership solutions, and that we have a significant 
 opportunity to invest in additional high-quality firms across the global investment management industry.

___________________________ 
 (1) Past performance is not indicative of future results. Performance and AUM information is as of September 30, 2024 and is 
 based on data available at the time of calculation. Product returns are sourced from Affiliates while benchmark returns are 
 generally sourced via third-party subscriptions. 
 (2) For liquid alternative, global equity, and U.S. equity products, performance is reported as the percentage of assets that have 
 outperformed benchmarks across the indicated periods, and excludes market-hedging products. For purposes of investment 
 performance comparisons, products are an aggregation of portfolios (separate accounts, investment funds, and other 
 products) that each represent a particular investment objective, using the most representative portfolio for the performance 
 comparison. Performance is presented for products with a three-, five-, and/or ten-year track record and is measured on a 
 consistent basis relative to the most appropriate benchmarks. Benchmark appropriateness is generally reviewed annually to 
 reflect any changes in how underlying portfolios/mandates are managed. Product and benchmark performance is reflected 
 as total return and is annualized. Reported product performance is gross-of-fees for institutional and high-net-worth 
 separate accounts, and generally net-of-fees across retail funds and other commingled vehicles such as hedge funds. 
 (3) Multi-asset and fixed income products are mainly our wealth management and solutions offerings. These investment 
 products are primarily customized toward wealth preservation, estate planning, and liability and tax management, and 
 therefore are typically not measured against a benchmark.

Table of Contents 

(4) For private markets products, performance is reported as the percentage of assets that have outperformed benchmarks on a 
 since-inception internal rate of return basis. Benchmarks utilized include a combination of public market equivalents, peer 
 medians, and absolute returns where benchmarks are not available. For purposes of investment performance comparisons, 
 the latest vintage comparison includes the most recent vehicles and strategies (traditional long-duration investment funds, 
 customized vehicles, and other evergreen vehicles and product structures) where meaningful performance is available and 
 calculable. In order to illustrate the performance of our private markets product category over a longer period of history, 
 the last three vintages comparison incorporates the latest vintage vehicles and the prior two vintages for traditional long- 
 duration investment funds, as well as additional vehicles and strategies launched during the equivalent time period as the 
 last three vintages of traditional long-duration investment funds. Due to the nature of these investments and vehicles, 
 reported performance is typically on a three- to six-month lag basis. 
 
 Aggregate Fees 
 Aggregate fees consist of asset- and performance-based fees of our consolidated and equity method Affiliates. Asset-based 
 fees include advisory and other fees earned by our Affiliates for services provided to their clients and are typically determined 
 as a percentage of the value of a client s assets under management, generally inclusive of uncalled commitments. Asset-based 
 fees are generally impacted by the level of average assets under management and the composition of these assets across our 
 strategies with different asset-based fee ratios. Our asset-based fee ratio is calculated as asset-based fees divided by average 
 assets under management. 
 In some cases, if product returns exceed certain performance thresholds, we will participate in performance-based fees. 
 Performance-based fees are based on investment performance, typically on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark or a 
 hurdle rate, and are generally recognized when it is improbable that there will be a significant reversal in the amount of revenue 
 recognized. Performance-based fees are generally billed less frequently than asset-based fees and will vary from period to 
 period because they inherently depend on investment performance. As of September 30, 2024 , approximately 27 of our total 
 assets under management could potentially earn performance-based fees. These percentages were approximately 12 and 46 
 of our assets under management for our consolidated Affiliates and Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, 
 respectively. We anticipate performance-based fees will be a recurring component of our aggregate fees; however we do not 
 anticipate these fees to be a significant component of our Consolidated revenue as these fees are predominately earned by our 
 Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. 
 Aggregate fees were 1,157.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , an increase of 159.6 million or 
 16 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in our aggregate fees was due to a 97.2 million 
 or 10 increase from asset-based fees and a 62.4 million or 6 increase from performance-based fees, primarily in our liquid 
 alternatives strategies. The increase in asset-based fees was principally due to an increase in our average assets under 
 management, primarily in our alternatives strategies, and changes in the composition of our assets under management primarily 
 driven by investments in new Affiliates. 
 Aggregate fees were 3,726.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , an increase of 221.1 million or 6 
 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in our aggregate fees was due to a 245.7 million or 
 7 increase from asset-based fees, offset by a 24.6 million or 1 decrease from performance-based fees, primarily in our 
 liquid alternatives strategies. The increase in asset-based fees was principally due to an increase in our average assets under 
 management, primarily in our alternatives strategies, and changes in the composition of our assets under management primarily 
 driven by investments in new Affiliates.

Table of Contents 

Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) is an important supplemental financial performance measure for management. 
 Our Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) increased 5.7 million or 3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 
 primarily due to a 159.6 million or 16 increase in aggregate fees. Adjusted EBITDA increased less than aggregate fees on a 
 percentage basis primarily due to the recognition of performance-based fees earned by Affiliates in which we hold a lesser 
 economic interest. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , our Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) increased 51.8 million or 
 8 , primarily from investments in new Affiliates and the recognition of performance-based fees earned by Affiliates in which 
 we hold a greater economic interest. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , our Net income (controlling interest) decreased 93.4 million or 43 . 
 This decrease was primarily due to the recognition of a 133.1 million pre-tax gain associated with the sale of our equity 
 interest in Veritable, LP Veritable in the third quarter of 2023 (the Veritable Transaction ), partially offset by a 46.4 
 million decrease in Income tax expense attributable to the controlling interest. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , our Net income (controlling interest) decreased 127.3 million or 27 . 
 This decrease was primarily due to the recognition of a 133.1 million pre-tax gain associated with the Veritable Transaction in 
 the third quarter of 2023 and a 30.4 million decrease in Investment and other income attributable to the controlling interest. 
 These decreases were partially offset by a 26.2 million decrease in Income tax expense attributable to the controlling interest. 
 We believe Economic net income (controlling interest) is an important supplemental financial performance measure 
 because it represents our performance before non-cash expenses relating to the acquisition of interests in Affiliates and 
 improves comparability of performance between periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , our Economic net 
 income (controlling interest) increased 3.7 million or 2 , primarily due to a 5.7 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA 
 (controlling interest), partially offset by a 3.6 million increase in Interest expense attributable to the controlling interest. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , our Economic net income (controlling interest) increased 20.9 million or 
 4 , primarily due to a 51.8 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest). This increase was partially offset by 
 a 26.2 million increase in current and other deferred taxes attributable to the controlling interest and a 5.7 million increase in 
 Interest expense attributable to the controlling interest. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion includes the key operating performance measures and financial results of our consolidated and 
 equity method Affiliates. Our consolidated Affiliates financial results are included in our Consolidated revenue, Consolidated 
 expenses, and Investment and other income, and our share of our equity method Affiliates financial results is reported, net of 
 intangible amortization and impairments, in Equity method income (net).

 million or 2 decrease from asset-based fees, offset by a 3.1 million increase from performance-based fees, primarily in our 
 private markets strategies. The decrease in asset-based fees was principally due to changes in the composition of our assets 
 under management driven by the Veritable Transaction, offset by an increase in our consolidated Affiliate average assets under 
 management, primarily in our alternative s strategies. 
 Our Consolidated revenue decreased 38.6 million or 2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to 
 a 39.2 million or 2 decrease from asset-based fees. The decrease in asset-based fees was principally due to changes in the 
 composition of our assets under management driven by the Veritable Transaction and a decrease in our consolidated Affiliate 
 average assets under management, primarily in our global equity strategies.

Compensation and related expenses increased 9.0 million or 4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 primarily due to a 13.6 million increase in compensation accruals at Affiliates, partially offset by a decrease in compensation 
 and related expenses due to the Veritable Transaction. 
 Compensation and related expenses increased 13.5 million or 2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 primarily due to a 21.9 million increase in compensation accruals primarily at Affiliates and a 7.0 million increase in Affiliate 
 equity compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in compensation and related expenses due to 
 the Veritable Transaction. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.9 million or 6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 primarily due to a 3.3 million increase in professional fees and a 2.4 million increase in distribution and investment-related 
 expenses, principally as a result of the increase in average assets under management on which these expenses are incurred. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.7 million or 2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 primarily due to a 7.3 million increase in distribution and investment-related expenses, principally as a result of the increase in 
 average assets under management on which these expenses are incurred. This increase was partially offset by a 1.3 million 
 decrease in non-income based and other taxes. 
 Intangible amortization and impairments decreased 5.2 million or 42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 primarily due to a 3.6 million decrease in amortization expense related to certain definite-lived assets being fully amortized 
 and a 1.7 million decrease due to the Veritable Transaction. 
 Intangible amortization and impairments decreased 15.7 million or 42 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 primarily due to a 10.6 million decrease in amortization expense related to certain definite-lived assets being fully amortized 
 and a 5.0 million decrease due to the Veritable Transaction. 
 Interest expense increased 3.6 million or 12 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to a 7.6 
 million increase from our 6.75 junior subordinated notes issued in March 2024 (the 2064 junior subordinated notes and a 
 2.5 million increase from our 5.50 senior unsecured notes issued in August 2024 (the 2034 senior notes ). This increase 
 was partially offset by a 4.4 million decrease due to the maturity of our 4.25 senior notes in February 2024 (the 2024 senior 
 notes and a 2.8 million decrease due to the repayment of our senior unsecured term loan facility (the term loan . 
 Interest expense increased 5.7 million or 6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to a 16.1 
 million increase from our 2064 junior subordinated notes and a 2.5 million increase from our 2034 senior notes. This increase 
 was partially offset by an 11.1 million decrease due to the maturity of our 2024 senior notes in February 2024 and a 2.5 
 million decrease primarily due to the repayment of our term loan. 
 There were no significant changes to Depreciation and other amortization for the three and nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 . 
 Other expenses (net) increased 3.7 million or 47 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to a 3.8

___________________________ 
 (1) Percentage change is not meaningful. 
 Our equity method revenue increased 168.4 million or 36 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , due to a 
 109.1 million or 23 increase from asset-based fees and a 59.3 million or 13 increase from performance-based fees, 
 primarily in our liquid alternatives strategies. The increase in asset-based fees was principally due to an increase in our equity 
 method Affiliate average assets under management, primarily in our alternatives strategies, and changes in the composition of 
 our assets under management primarily driven by investments in new Affiliates. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , equity method earnings increased 14.3 million or 23 , primarily due to 
 a 168.4 million or 36 increase in equity method revenue. Equity method earnings increased less than equity method revenue 
 on a percentage basis primarily due to the recognition of performance-based fees earned by Affiliates in which we hold a lesser 
 economic interest and an increase in revenue at certain Affiliates in which we share in revenue less agreed-upon expenses . 
 Equity method intangible amortization increased 1.5 million or 7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 primarily due to a 5.3 million increase in amortization expense due to investments in new Affiliates and a 4.5 million 
 increase in amortization expense due to an increase in actual and expected client attrition for certain definite-lived acquired 
 client relationships. These increases were partially offset by an 8.3 million decrease in amortization expense related to certain 
 definite-lived assets being fully amortized. 
 Our equity method revenue increased 259.7 million or 13 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , due to a 
 284.9 million or 14 increase from asset-based fees, offset by a 25.2 million or 1 decrease from performance-based fees, 
 primarily in our liquid alternatives strategies. The increase in asset-based fees was principally due to an increase in our equity 
 method Affiliate average assets under management, primarily in our alternatives strategies, and changes in the composition of 
 our assets under management primarily driven by investments in new Affiliates. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , equity method earnings increased 75.3 million or 35 , primarily due to a 
 259.7 million or 13 increase in equity method revenue. Equity method earnings increased more than equity method revenue 
 on a percentage basis primarily due to an increase in earnings at certain Affiliates in which we share in revenue less agreed- 
 upon expenses and the recognition of performance-based fees earned by Affiliates in which we hold a greater economic interest.

Equity method intangible amortization increased 1.4 million or 2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 primarily due to a 15.8 million increase in amortization expense due to investments in new Affiliates and a 10.5 million 
 increase in amortization expense due to an increase in actual and expected client attrition for certain definite-lived acquired 
 client relationships. These increases were partially offset by a 24.9 million decrease in amortization expense related to certain 
 definite-lived assets being fully amortized. 
 Equity method intangible impairments increased 39.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . See Note

 share-based compensation in the three months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Income tax expense decreased 25.4 million or 16 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Our effective rate 
 (controlling interest) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.1 as compared to 23.9 for the nine months 
 ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in the tax rate (controlling interest) was primarily due to discrete foreign tax benefits 
 and tax windfalls attributable to share-based compensation in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , and an expense to 
 reduce the carrying value of an Affiliate to fair value for which no tax benefit was recorded, partially offset by higher tax 
 windfalls attributable to share-based compensation in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

Net income (controlling interest) decreased 93.4 million or 43 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 primarily due to the recognition of a pre-tax gain associated with the Veritable Transaction in the third quarter of 2023, partially 
 offset by a decrease in Income tax expense attributable to the controlling interest. 
 Net income (controlling interest) decreased 127.3 million or 27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 primarily due to the recognition of a pre-tax gain associated with the Veritable Transaction in the third quarter of 2023 and a 
 decrease in Investment and other income attributable to the controlling interest. These decreases were partially offset by a 
 decrease in Income tax expense attributable to the controlling interest. 
 
 Supplemental Financial Performance Measures 
 As supplemental information, we provide non-GAAP performance measures of Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest), 
 Economic net income (controlling interest), and Economic earnings per share. We believe that many investors use our 
 Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) when comparing our financial performance to other companies in the investment 
 management industry. Management utilizes these non-GAAP performance measures to assess our performance before our 
 share of certain non-cash GAAP expenses primarily related to the acquisition of interests in Affiliates and to improve 
 comparability between periods. Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share are used by 
 management and our Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmarks, including as one of the measures for 
 determining executive compensation. These non-GAAP performance measures are provided in addition to, but not as a 
 substitute for, Net income (controlling interest), Earnings per share, or other GAAP performance measures. 
 Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) 
 Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our performance before our share of interest expense, income and 
 certain non-income based taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments, gains and losses related to Affiliate Transactions, and 
 non-cash items such as certain Affiliate equity activity, gains and losses on our contingent payment obligations, and unrealized 
 gains and losses on seed capital, general partner commitments, and other strategic investments. Adjusted EBITDA (controlling 
 interest) is also adjusted to include realized economic gains and losses related to these seed capital, general partner 
 commitments, and other strategic investments.

(2) The three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes Veritable Transaction gain of 133.1 million and gains of 
 6.5 million and 29.6 million on ordinary shares of EQT AB EQT ), a public company listed on Nasdaq Stockholm 
 (EQT.ST), respectively. We received the EQT shares through the sale of our equity interest in Baring Private Equity Asia 
 BPEA ), in connection with the strategic combination of BPEA and EQT, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 
 2022. 
 (3) Other items include certain non-income based taxes, depreciation, and non-cash items such as certain Affiliate equity 
 activity, gains and losses on our contingent payment obligations, unrealized gains and losses on seed capital, general 
 partner commitments, and other strategic investments, and realized economic gains and losses related to these seed capital, 
 general partner commitments, and other strategic investments. 
 Economic Net Income (controlling interest) and Economic Earnings Per Share 
 Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we adjust Net income (controlling interest) for our share 
 of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments related to intangible assets (including the portion attributable to equity 
 method investments in Affiliates) because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in the value of these assets, which 
 do not diminish predictably over time. We also adjust for deferred taxes attributable to intangible assets because we believe it 
 is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. Further, we adjust for gains and losses related to 
 Affiliate Transactions, net of tax, and other economic items. 
 Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average shares 
 outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, we exclude the potential shares issued upon settlement of Redeemable non- 
 controlling interests from Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted) because we intend to settle those obligations without 
 issuing shares, consistent with all prior Affiliate equity purchase transactions. The potential share issuance in connection with 
 our junior convertible securities is measured using a treasury stock method. Under this method, only the net number of 
 shares of common stock equal to the value of these junior convertible securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be 
 outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in 
 available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of our common stock) that occurs when these securities 
 are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation.

 interest) and Economic earnings per share:

 partner commitments, and other strategic investments. Other economic items were net of income tax expense of 
 0.3 million and 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 , respectively, and 4.7 million and 
 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 , respectively. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate long-term value by investing in new Affiliate partnerships, existing Affiliates, and strategic value-add 
 capabilities through which we can leverage our scale and resources to benefit our Affiliates and enhance their long-term growth 
 prospects. Given our annual cash generation from operations, in addition to investing for growth in our business, we are also 
 able to return excess capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchases. We continue to manage our capital structure 
 consistent with an investment grade company and are currently rated A3 by Moody s Investor Services and BBB+ by S P 
 Global Ratings. 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 1,010.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and were attributable to both our controlling 
 and the non-controlling interests. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we met our cash requirements primarily 
 through cash generated by operating activities. Our principal uses of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 
 for the return of excess capital through share repurchases, repayment of debt, purchases of investment securities, and 
 distributions to Affiliate equity holders. 
 We expect investments in new Affiliates, investments in existing Affiliates, primarily through purchases of Affiliate equity 
 interests and general partner and seed capital investments, the return of capital through share repurchases and the payment of 
 cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of debt, distributions to Affiliate equity holders, payment of income taxes, 
 purchases of marketable securities, and general working capital to be the primary uses of cash on a consolidated basis for the 
 foreseeable future. We anticipate that our current cash balance, cash flows from operations, proceeds from sales of our 
 marketable securities, and borrowings under our senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility (the revolver will 
 be sufficient to support our uses of cash for the foreseeable future. In addition, we may draw funding from the debt and equity 
 capital markets, and our credit ratings, among other factors, allow us to access these sources of funding on favorable terms.

Operating Cash Flow 
 Operating cash flows are calculated by adjusting Net income for other significant sources and uses of cash, significant non- 
 cash items, and timing differences in the cash settlement of assets and liabilities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Cash flows from operating activities were 719.6 million , primarily from 
 Net income of 519.5 million and distributions of earnings received from equity method investments of 357.3 million . These 
 items were partially offset by timing differences in the cash settlement of receivables, other assets, and payables, accrued 
 liabilities, and other liabilities of 100.0 million . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , operating cash flows were 
 primarily attributable to the controlling interest. 
 Investing Cash Flow 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Cash flows from investing activities were 370.6 million , primarily due to 
 875.2 million of maturities and sales of investment securities, partially offset by 496.4 million of purchases of investment 
 securities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , investing cash flows were primarily attributable to the controlling 
 interest. 
 Financing Cash Flow 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Cash flows used in financing activities were 904.1 million , primarily due 
 to 589.5 million of repurchases of common stock (net), repayment of senior notes and senior bank debt of 400.0 million and 
 350.0 million , respectively, 206.5 million of distributions to non-controlling interests, and 54.1 million of Affiliate equity 
 purchases, net of issuances. These items were partially offset by the issuance of junior subordinated notes and senior notes of 
 450.0 million and 397.6 million, respectively. 
 
 Affiliate Equity 
 We periodically purchase Affiliate equity from and issue Affiliate equity to our consolidated Affiliate partners and other 
 parties under agreements that provide us with a conditional right to call and Affiliate equity holders with a conditional right to 
 put their Affiliate equity interests to us at certain intervals. We have the right to settle a portion of these purchases in shares of 
 our common stock. For Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, we do not typically have such put and call 
 arrangements. The purchase price of these conditional purchases is generally calculated based upon a multiple of the Affiliate s 
 cash flow distributions, which is intended to represent fair value. Affiliate equity holders are also permitted to sell their equity 
 interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, subject to our approval or other restrictions. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the current redemption value of Affiliate equity interests was 456.0 million , of which 397.1 
 million was presented as Redeemable non-controlling interests (including 13.3 million of consolidated Affiliate sponsored 
 investment products primarily attributable to third-party investors), and 58.9 million was included in Other liabilities. 
 Although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict, we paid 60.4 million for Affiliate equity purchases 
 and received 6.3 million for Affiliate equity issuances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and we expect net 
 purchases of approximately 60 million of Affiliate equity during the remainder of 2024 . In the event of a purchase, we 
 become the owner of the cash flow associated with the purchased equity. See Notes 13 and 14 of our Consolidated Financial 
 Statements. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 Our Board of Directors authorized share repurchase programs in October 2022 , October 2023 , and July 2024 to repurchase 
 up to 3.0 million , 3.3 million , and 5.4 million sha res of our common stock, respectively, and these authorizations have no 
 expiry. Purchases may be made from time to time, at management s discretion, in the open market or in privately negotiated 
 transactions, including through the use of trading plans, as well as pursuant to accelerated share repurchase programs or other 
 share repurchase strategies that may include derivative financial instruments. As of March 31, 2024 , we had repurchased all of 
 the shares in the repurchase program authorized in October 2022. D uring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 we repurchased 0.6 million and 3.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of 163.23 and 158.62 ,

 As of September 30, 2024 , we had a 1.25 billion revolver. The revolver matures on October 25, 2027 and the term loan 
 terminated upon payment in full. Subject to certain conditions, we may increase the commitments under the revolver by up to 
 an additional 500.0 million . 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolver, and could borrow all capacity and remain 
 in compliance with the revolver.

On August 20, 2024, we issued 400.0 million of 2034 senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of August 20, 2034. 
 Interest is payable beginning February 20, 2025. In addition to customary event of default provisions, the indenture governing 
 the 2034 senior notes limits our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets and requires us to make 
 an offer to repurchase the 2034 senior notes upon certain change of control triggering events. 
 The senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a make-whole redemption price (plus accrued and unpaid 
 interest), at any time, in the case of the 2025 senior notes, at any time prior to March 15, 2030, in the case of the 2030 senior 
 notes, and at any time prior to May 20, 2034, in the case of the 2034 senior notes. In addition, the 2030 and 2034 senior notes 
 may be redeemed at par, in whole or in part, at any time, on or after March 15, 2030 and May 20, 2034, respectively. We may 
 also repurchase senior notes in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time at management s 
 discretion.

We have used a majority of the net proceeds from the 2034 senior notes for the repayment of the term loan, and in the

On March 20, 2024, we issued 450.0 million of 2064 junior subordinated notes with a maturity date of March 30, 2064. 
 Interest was payable commencing on June 30, 2024, and we have the right to defer interest payments in accordance with the 
 terms of the notes. The 2064 junior subordinated notes were issued at 100 of the principal amount and rank junior and 
 subordinate in right of payment and upon liquidation to all of our current and future senior indebtedness. As of September 30, 
 2024 , the 2059 junior subordinated notes could be redeemed at any time, in whole or in part. The other junior subordinated 
 notes may be redeemed at any time, in whole or in part, on or after September 30, 2025, in the case of the 2060 junior 
 subordinated notes, on or after September 30, 2026, in the case of the 2061 junior subordinated notes, and on or after March 30, 
 2029, in the case of the 2064 junior subordinated notes. In each case, the junior subordinated notes may be redeemed at 100 
 of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Prior to the applicable 
 redemption date, at our option, the applicable junior subordinated notes may also be redeemed, in whole but not in part, at 
 100 of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if certain changes in tax laws, regulations, or 
 interpretations occur; or at 102 of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if a rating agency makes certain 
 changes relating to the equity credit criteria for securities with features similar to the applicable notes. 
 We have used, and in the future intend to use, the net proceeds from the 2064 junior subordinated notes for general 
 corporate purposes, which may include the repayment or refinancing of indebtedness , share repurchases, and investments in 
 new and existing Affiliates. 
 Junior Convertible Securities 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had 341.7 million of principal outstanding in our 5.15 junior convertible trust preferred 
 securities (the junior convertible securities ), maturing in 2037. The junior convertible securities were issued by AMG Capital 
 Trust II, a Delaware statutory trust, in October 2007. Each of the junior convertible securities represents an undivided 
 beneficial interest in the assets of the trust. The trust s only assets are junior subordinated convertible debentures issued to it by 
 us, and have substantially the same payment terms as the junior convertible securities. We own all of the trust s common 
 securities, and have fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, the payment obligations on the junior 
 convertible securities. We do not consolidate the trust s financial results into our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Holders of the junior convertible securities have no rights to put these securities to us. Upon conversion, holders will 
 receive cash or shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. We may redeem the junior convertible 
 securities, subject to our stock trading at or above certain specified levels over specified periods, and may also repurchase junior 
 convertible securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time at management s discretion. 
 We did not repurchase any of our junior convertible securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 . 
 Equity Distribution Program 
 In the second quarter of 2022, we entered into equity distribution and forward equity agreements with several major 
 securities firms under which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock (immediately or on a 
 forward basis) having an aggregate sales price of up to 500.0 million (the equity distribution program ). This equity 
 distribution program superseded and replaced our prior equity distribution program. As of September 30, 2024 , no sales had 
 occurred under the equity distribution program.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes to our Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for the nine 
 months ended September 30, 2024 , except as noted below. Please refer to Item 7A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We have fixed rates of interest on our senior notes, junior subordinated notes, and junior convertible securities. While a 
 change in market interest rates would not affect the interest expense incurred on our fixed rate securities, such a change may 
 affect the fair value of these securities. We estimate that a 1 change in interest rates would have resulted in a 204.7 million 
 net change in fair value of our fixed rate securities as of September 30, 2024. This represents an increase of 59.0 million as 
 compared to the estimated impact of a 1 change in interest rates as of December 31, 2023. This increase is primarily due to 
 the issuances of 450.0 million of 2064 junior subordinated notes in March 2024 and 400.0 million of 2034 senior notes in 
 August 2024 . 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief 
 Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and 
 procedures during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief 
 Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on 
 Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that (i) the information required to be disclosed by 
 us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is 
 recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s 
 rules and forms, and (ii) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal 
 executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In 
 designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how 
 well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our 
 management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives, and 
 our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were 
 effective at the reasonable assurance level. We review on an ongoing basis and document our disclosure controls and 
 procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, and we may from time to time make changes in an effort to
