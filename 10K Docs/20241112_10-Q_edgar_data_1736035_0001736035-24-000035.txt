 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (together, with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company , we, us, or our ), our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 our future operating results; 
 our business prospects and the prospects of the companies in which we may invest; 
 the impact of the investments that we expect to make; 
 our ability to raise sufficient capital and buy back shares to execute our investment strategy; 
 general economic, logistical and political trends and other external factors, including inflation and recent supply chain disruptions and their impacts on our portfolio companies and on the industries in which we invest; 
 the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 
 our current and expected financing arrangements and investments; 
 changes in the general interest rate environment; 
 the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital; 
 the timing and amount of cash flows, distributions and dividends, if any, from our portfolio companies; 
 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 actual and potential conflicts of interest with Blackstone Credit BDC Advisors LLC (the Adviser or any of its affiliates; 
 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we may invest; 
 our use of financial leverage including the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments and the availability of equity and debt capital on favorable terms or at all; 
 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies, including our and their ability to effectively respond to the macroeconomic effects from adverse public health developments; 
 the ability of the Adviser to source suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 
 the impact of future acquisitions and divestitures; 
 the ability of the Adviser or its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 
 general price and volume fluctuations in the stock market; 
 our ability to maintain our qualification as a regulated investment company and as a business development company BDC ); 
 the impact on our business of U.S. and international financial reform legislation, rules and regulations; 
 the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position; and 
 the tax status of the enterprises in which we may invest. 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of any projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in the section entitled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as updated by the Company's periodic filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). These projections and forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this report. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future file with the SEC including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. 
 Because we are an investment company, the forward-looking statements and projections contained in this report are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).

 million and million, respectively, in non-recurring interest income (e.g., prepayment premiums, accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded million and million, respectively, in non-recurring interest income. 
 PIK Income 
 The Company has loans in its portfolio that contain payment-in-kind PIK provisions. PIK represents interest that is accrued and recorded as interest income at the contractual rates, increases the loan principal on the respective capitalization dates, and is generally due at maturity. Such income is included in Payment-in-kind interest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest is generally reversed through Payment-in-kind interest income. To satisfy the Company s annual RIC distribution requirements, this non-cash source of income must be included in determining the amounts to be paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends, even though the Company has not yet collected cash. 
 Dividend Income 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. 
 Fee Income 
 The Company may receive various fees in the ordinary course of business such as structuring, consent, waiver, amendment, syndication and other miscellaneous fees as well as fees for managerial assistance rendered by the Company to the portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered.

 as opposed to a single quarter measurement and became subject to an Incentive Fee Cap (as defined below) based on the Company s Cumulative Net Return (as defined below). The amendment to the Investment Advisory Agreement does not result in higher fees (on a cumulative basis) payable to the Adviser than the fees that would have otherwise been payable to the Adviser under the original investment advisory agreement. 
 The Company pays the Adviser a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components: a management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the management fee and the incentive fee is borne by the shareholders. The initial term of the Investment Advisory Agreement was from October 1, 2018, and on May 6, 2020 and May 6, 2021, it was renewed and approved by the Board, including a majority of trustees who are not parties to the Investment Advisory Agreement or interested persons (as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) (the Independent Trustees ), for a period. On October 18, 2021, the Board approved the amended and restated Investment Advisory Agreement. Unless earlier terminated, the Investment Advisory Agreement will renew automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the vote of the Board and by the vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees. The Investment Advisory Agreement was most recently renewed and approved by the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, on May 1, 2024 for a period ending on May 31, 2025.

 . With the waiver in place, instead of having the base management fee and each incentive fee increase to and , respectively, following the IPO, each such fee remained at and , respectively, for a period of following the IPO (the Waiver Period ). As a result of the fee waiver, the pre-listing management fee and incentive fee rates paid by the Company to the Adviser did not increase during the Waiver Period. Amounts waived by the Adviser are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. The Waiver Period ended on October 28, 2023. 
 Base Management Fees 
 Starting from the consummation of the IPO, the management fee pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement is payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of of the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, gross assets means the Company s total assets determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, excluding undrawn commitments but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts. The management fee was calculated for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, and the quarter ended December 31, 2023, at a weighted rate calculated based on the fee rates applicable before and after the consummation of the IPO and the expiration of the Waiver Period based on the number of days in the calendar quarter before and after the consummation of the IPO and the expiration of the Waiver Period. 
 Prior to the consummation of the IPO, the management fee was of the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. In order to maintain the same management fee arrangement that the Company had in place prior to the IPO for a period of time following the consummation of the IPO, the Adviser voluntarily waived its right to receive the base management fee in excess of of the average value of the Company s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters during the Waiver Period. Amounts waived by the Adviser are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, base management fees were million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, base management fees were million and million, respectively, of which million and million, respectively, were waived. The Waiver Period ended on October 28, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, was payable to the Adviser relating to management fees. 
 Incentive Fees 
 The incentive fees consist of two components that are determined independently of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. One component is based on income and the other component is based on capital gains, each as described below: 
 (i) Income based incentive fees: 
 The first part of the incentive fee, an income based incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as defined in the Investment Advisory Agreement. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero-coupon securities)), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income excludes any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The Company excludes the impact of expense support payments and recoupments from pre-incentive fee net investment income. Shareholders may be charged a fee on an income amount that is higher than the income they may ultimately receive.

 per quarter annualized). 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company is required to pay an income based incentive fee of prior to the consummation of the IPO), with a hurdle and catch-up. However, the Adviser implemented a voluntary waiver with respect to the income based incentive fee during the Waiver Period. The Adviser voluntarily waived its right to receive an income based incentive fee above during the Waiver Period and amounts waived by the Adviser were not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. 
 The Company pays the Adviser an income based incentive fee based on its aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income, as adjusted as described above, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (such period, the Trailing Twelve Quarters ). 
 The hurdle amount for the income based incentive fee is determined on a quarterly basis and is equal to multiplied by the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments for issuances by the Company of Common Shares, including issuances pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan DRIP and distributions that occurred during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The income based incentive fee for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. 
 For the income based incentive fee, the Company will pay the Adviser a quarterly incentive fee based on the amount by which (A) aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (B) the hurdle amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve Quarters is referred to as the Excess Income Amount . 
 The income based incentive fee for each quarter will be determined as follows: 
 No income based incentive fee is payable to the Adviser for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount. 
 The Adviser will be paid of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters, if any, that exceeds the hurdle amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters, but is less than or equal to an amount, which we refer to as the Catch-up Amount, determined as the sum of annualized) annualized) during the Waiver Period), multiplied by the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters that is included in the calculation of the incentive fee based on income. 
 The Adviser will be paid during the Waiver Period), of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters that exceeds the Catch-up Amount. 
 The amount of the income based incentive fee that will be paid to the Adviser for a particular quarter will equal the excess of (a) the income based incentive fee so calculated over (b) the aggregate income based incentive fee that was paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters subject to the Incentive Fee Cap as described below. 
 The income based incentive fee that will be paid to the Adviser for a particular quarter is subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ). The Incentive Fee Cap for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) prior to the end of the Waiver Period), of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (b) the aggregate income based incentive fee that was paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.

 of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains based incentive fees as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 Prior to the IPO, the second part of the incentive fee, a capital gains incentive fee, was determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year in an amount equal to of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains based incentive fees as calculated in accordance with GAAP. However, similar to the voluntary waivers referenced above, the Adviser voluntarily waived its right to receive a capital gains based incentive fee above from the date of consummation of the IPO through the Waiver Period. The Company will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Company were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. Amounts waived by the Adviser are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company accrued income based incentive fees of million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company accrued income based incentive fees of million and million, respectively, of which million and million, respectively, were waived.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, was payable to the Adviser for income based incentive fees.

The April 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of per year payable semi-annually on April 13 and October 13 of each year, commencing on April 13, 2025. The April 2028 Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company that rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the April 2028 Notes, rank pari passu with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness issued by the Company that are not so subordinated, rank effectively junior to any of the Company s secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that the Company later secures) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and rank structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by the Company s subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities. 
 In connection with the April 2028 Notes, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to more closely align the interest rates of the Company s liabilities with the investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Financial Statements hereto and Part II, Item 8-Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , as updated from time to time by the Company's periodic filings with the SEC. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors outside of the Company s control including, but not limited to, those set forth in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , as updated from time to time by the Company's periodic filings with the SEC. 
 
 Overview and Investment Framework 
 We are a Delaware statutory trust structured as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. We are managed by our Adviser. The Administrator will provide the administrative services necessary for us to operate. 
 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on loans and securities, including syndicated loans, of private U.S. companies, which includes larger and middle market companies. In many market environments, we believe such a focus offers an opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns. 
 Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, trading prices of loans and other securities and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and dividends. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to eight years and bear interest at floating rates on the basis of a benchmark such as SOFR, SONIA, etc. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. 
 In addition, we generate revenue from various fees in the ordinary course of business such as in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, consent, waiver, amendment, syndication and other miscellaneous fees as well as fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies.

We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (a) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the amended and restated investment advisory agreement dated October 18, 2021 (as amended and restated, the Investment Advisory Agreement ; (b) our allocable portion of compensation, overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, including but not limited to: (i) our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs; (ii) investor relations, legal, operations and other non-investment professionals (including information technology professionals) at the Administrator that perform duties for us; and (iii) any internal audit group personnel of Blackstone or any of its affiliates; and (c) all other expenses of our operations, administrations and transactions. 
 From time to time, the Adviser, the Administrator or their affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services on our behalf. We will reimburse the Adviser, the Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts. From time to time, the Adviser or the Administrator may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. The Administrator has elected to forgo any reimbursement for rent and other occupancy costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. However, the Administrator may seek reimbursement for such costs in future periods. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders. 
 Costs and expenses of the Administrator and the Adviser that are eligible for reimbursement by us will be reasonably allocated on the basis of time spent, assets under management, usage rates, proportionate holdings, a combination thereof or other reasonable methods determined by the Administrator in accordance with policies adopted by the Board.

 Results of Operations 
 The following table represents the operating results (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total investment income 343,218 283,959 974,242 839,263 Net expenses before excise tax 153,387 118,180 438,695 345,220 Net investment income before excise tax 189,831 165,779 535,547 494,043 Excise tax expense 3,928 4,988 10,698 12,589 Net investment income after excise tax 185,903 160,791 524,849 481,454 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) 
 (19,130) 20,740 13,720 (31,299) Net realized gain (loss) (15,109) (10,536) (6,964) 4,488 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 151,664 170,995 531,605 454,643 
 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including acquisitions, the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. As a result, comparisons may not be meaningful. 
 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income was as follows (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest income 321,490 272,464 907,582 800,599 Payment-in-kind interest income 21,207 10,689 64,545 31,805 Dividend income 11 213 200 373 Fee income 510 593 1,915 6,486 Total investment income 343,218 283,959 974,242 839,263 
 Total investment income increased to 343.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 59.3 million, or 21 , compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily attributable to an increase in the average investments at fair value. Average investments at fair value increased by 24 to 11,636.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9,394.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Additionally, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 1.6 million of non-recurring interest income (e.g., prepayment premiums, accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts, etc.) as compared to 1.0 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of increased prepayments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Payment-in-kind interest income represented 6.2 and 3.8 of total investment income, respectively. We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors including the pace of our originations, repayments and changes in interest rates. We expect that Payment-in-kind interest income will vary based on the elections of certain borrowers. 
 101 

Table of Contents 

 Total investment income increased to 974.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 135.0 million, or 16 , compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily attributable to an increase in the average investments at fair value. Average investments at fair value increased by 15 to 10,895.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9,508.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 3.8 million of non-recurring interest income (e.g., prepayment premiums, accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts, etc.) as compared to 14.4 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of decreased prepayments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Payment-in-kind interest income represented 6.6 and 3.8 of total investment income, respectively. We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors including the pace of our originations, repayments and changes in interest rates. 
 While elevated interest rates continued to favorably impact our investment income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest rates have begun to decline, with the first Federal Reserve interest rate reduction in September 2024 and a further reduction in November 2024. Future decreases in benchmark interest rates may adversely impact our investment income. Conversely, future increases in benchmark interest rates and the resulting impacts to cost of capital have the potential to negatively impact the free cash flow and credit quality of certain borrowers which could impact their ability to make principal and interest payments. If such interest rate fluctuations occur concurrently with a period of economic weakness or a slowdown in growth, our borrowers and/or our portfolio performance may be negatively impacted. Further, significant market dislocation as a result of changing economic conditions could limit the liquidity of certain assets traded in the credit markets, and this could impact our ability to sell such assets at attractive prices or in a timely manner. 
 
 Expenses 
 Expenses were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest expense 88,191 65,253 233,752 198,129 Management fees

 Interest Expense 
 Total interest expense was 88.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 22.9 million, or 35 , compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily driven by an increase in our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings relative to the prior period and an increase in our average principal of debt outstanding. Our weighted average interest rate (including unused fees, accretion of net discounts on unsecured debt, and the impact of the application of hedge accounting and excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) increased to 5.45 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.94 for the same period in the prior year. The average principal of debt outstanding increased to 6,299.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5,033.7 million for the same period in the prior year.

Table of Contents 

 Total interest expense was 233.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 35.6 million, or 18 , compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily driven by an increase in our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings relative to the prior period. Our weighted average interest rate (including unused fees, accretion of net discounts on unsecured debt, and the impact of the application of hedge accounting and excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) increased to 5.26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.80 for the same period in the prior year. The average principal of debt outstanding increased to 5,717.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5,341.4 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 Management Fees 
 Management fees increased to 30.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.0 million, or 25 , compared to the same period in the prior year, due to an increase in average quarter end gross assets. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our average quarter end gross assets increased to 12,071.0 million, from 9,687.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Adviser voluntarily waived management fees following the IPO such that the management fee remained at 0.75 for a period of two years following the IPO (versus the contractual rate of 1.00 ), which resulted in a waiver of 6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Waiver Period ended on October 28, 2023. 
 Management fees increased to 84.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 11.1 million, or 15 , compared to the same period in the prior year, due to an increase in average quarter end gross assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our average quarter end gross assets increased to 11,245.4 million from 9,782.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Adviser voluntarily waived management fees following the IPO such that the management fee remained at 0.75 for a period of two years following the IPO (versus the contractual rate of 1.00 ), which resulted in a waiver of 18.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Waiver Period ended on October 28, 2023. 
 Income Based Incentive Fees 
 Income based incentive fees increased to 38.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 33.4 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income. Pre-incentive fee net investment income increased to 218.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 190.9 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 The Adviser voluntarily waived incentive fees following the IPO such that the fee remained at 15.0 for a period of two years following the IPO (versus the contractual rate of 17.5 ), which resulted in a waiver of 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Waiver Period ended on October 28, 2023. 
 Income based incentive fees increased to 111.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 98.3 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income. Pre-incentive fee net investment income increased to 636.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 561.7 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 The Adviser voluntarily waived incentive fees following the IPO such that the fee remained at 15.0 for a period of two years following the IPO (versus the contractual rate of 17.5 ), which resulted in a waiver of 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Waiver Period ended on October 28, 2023. 
 Capital Gains Based Incentive Fees 
 We reversed previously accrued capital gains based incentive fees of 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to accruing 1.5 million of capital gains based incentive fees for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This is primarily due to a net change in unrealized losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net change in unrealized gains during the same period in the prior year. 
 We accrued capital gains based incentive fees of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the reversal of the previously accrued capital gains based incentive fees of 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to net unrealized gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net unrealized losses during the same period in the prior year. 
 103 

Table of Contents 

 The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. 
 Other Expenses 
 Professional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of us. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers, their respective staff and other non-investment professionals that perform duties for us. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, our sub-administrator, subscriptions and other costs. 
 Total other expenses decreased to 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.6 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in Other General and Administrative expenses. 
 Total other expenses decreased to 9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.0 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in Other General and Administrative expenses. 
 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for taxation as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued 3.9 million and 5.0 million, respectively, of U.S. federal excise tax. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued 10.7 million and 12.6 million, respectively, of U.S. federal excise tax. 
 
 Net Unrealized Gain (Loss) 
 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) was comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments 
 (16,875) 20,873 15,872 (27,800) Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies 
 (2,255) (133) (2,152) (3,499) Net change in unrealized gain (loss) 
 (19,130) 20,740 13,720 (31,299) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net change in unrealized losses of 19.1 million was primarily driven by the decrease in the fair value of our debt investments. The fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal decreased by 0.2 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 driven primarily by changes in portfolio company fundamentals and economic outlook.

 Portfolio Company Commitments 
 Our investment portfolio contains and is expected to continue to contain debt investments which are in the form of lines of credit or delayed draw commitments, which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with underlying loan agreements.

 Additionally, from time to time, the Adviser and its affiliates may commit to an investment on behalf of the investment vehicles it manages, including the Company. Certain terms of these investments are not finalized at the time of the commitment and each respective investment vehicle s allocation may change prior to the date of funding. In this regard, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we estimate that 112.9 million and 221.3 million, respectively, of investments were committed but not yet funded.

 Recent Developments 
 Macroeconomic Environment 
 The nine months ended September 30, 2024, have been characterized by continued uncertainty in global markets, driven by investor concerns over inflation, elevated interest rates, slowing economic growth, political and regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical conditions, including the wars in Ukraine and Russia and in the Middle East. 
 During 2023 and throughout the first three quarters of 2024, inflation began to moderate as a result of the monetary policy tightening actions taken by central banks, including maintaining elevated interest rates. Despite the Federal Reserve s interest rate reductions during the third quarter and first half of the fourth quarter, interest rates remain elevated relative to the interest rate environment prior to the inflationary spike in 2022-2023, which continues to create further uncertainty for the economy and for our borrowers. Future decreases in benchmark interest rates may adversely impact our investment income. Although our business model is such that elevated interest rates will, all else being equal, correlate to increases in our net income, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our existing borrowers and lead to nonperformance, as higher costs may dampen consumer spending and slow corporate profit growth, which may negatively impact our portfolio companies as they may be susceptible to economic downturns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods. Although additional interest rate increases are not expected in the near term, during periods in which interest rates rise further, our non-performing assets may increase and the value of our portfolio may decrease if we are required to write down the values of our investments. Adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of recent changes and any future changes with respect to interest rates or inflation. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024, and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and practices.

 3. Transactions with Affiliates . The Adviser is authorized on behalf of the Fund, from time to time when deemed to be in the best interests of the Fund and to the extent permitted by applicable law, to purchase and or sell securities in which the Adviser or any of its affiliates underwrites, deals in and or makes a market and or may perform or seek to perform investment banking services for issuers of such securities. The Adviser is further authorized, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to select brokers (including any brokers affiliated with the Adviser) for the execution of trades for the Fund. 
 4. Best Execution Research Services . The Adviser is authorized, for the purchase and sale of the Fund s portfolio securities, to employ such dealers and brokers as may, in the judgment of the Adviser, implement the policy of the Fund to obtain the best results, taking into account such factors as price, including dealer spread, the size, type and difficulty of the transaction involved, the firm s general execution and operational facilities and the firm s risk in positioning the securities involved. Consistent with this policy, the Adviser is authorized to direct the execution of the Fund s portfolio transactions to dealers and brokers furnishing statistical information or research deemed by the Adviser to be useful or valuable to the performance of its investment advisory functions for the Fund. It is understood that in these circumstances, as contemplated by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the commissions paid may be higher than those which the Fund might otherwise have paid to another broker if those services had not been provided. Information so received will be in addition to and not in lieu of the services required to be performed by the Adviser. It is understood that the expenses of the Adviser will not necessarily be reduced as a result of the receipt of such information or research. Research services furnished to the Adviser by brokers who effect securities transactions for the Fund may be used by the Adviser in servicing other investment companies, entities or funds and accounts which it manages. Similarly, research services furnished to the Adviser by brokers who effect securities transactions for other investment companies, entities or funds and accounts which the Adviser manages may be used by the Adviser in servicing the Fund. It is understood that not all of these research services are used by the Adviser in managing any particular account, including the Fund. 
 The Adviser and its affiliates may aggregate purchase or sale orders for the assets with purchase or sale orders for the same security for other clients accounts of the Adviser or of its affiliates, the Adviser s own accounts and hold proprietary positions in accordance with its current aggregation and allocation policy (collectively, the Advisory Clients ), but only if (x) 
 8 

in the Adviser s reasonable judgment such aggregation results in an overall economic or other benefit to the assets taking into consideration the advantageous selling or purchase price, brokerage commission and other expenses and factors and (y) the Adviser s actions with respect to aggregating orders for multiple Advisory Clients, as well as the Fund, are consistent with applicable law. However, the Adviser is under no obligation to aggregate any such orders under any circumstances. 
 5. Remuneration . 
 The Fund agrees to pay, and the Adviser agrees to accept, as compensation for the services provided by the Adviser hereunder, a base management fee and an incentive fee as hereinafter set forth. The Fund shall make any payments due hereunder to the Adviser or to the Adviser s designee as the Adviser may otherwise direct, including any sub-adviser. 
 (a) Management Fee . The management fee is paid quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.0 of the average value of the Fund s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. For purposes of this Agreement, gross assets means the Fund s total assets determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), excluding undrawn commitments but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts. 
 (b) Incentive Fee . The incentive fee will consist of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of the Fund s income and a portion is based on a percentage of the Fund s capital gains, each as described below. 
 (1) Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income . The portion based on the Fund s income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Fund receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Fund s operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee). 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Fund has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment 
 9 

Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of 1.5 per quarter (6.0 annualized). 
 The Fund will pay the Adviser an income based incentive fee quarterly in arrears based on the amount by which (x) its aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (such period, the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (y) the Preferred Return Amount (as defined below) in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Preferred Return Amount will be determined on a quarterly basis, and will be calculated by multiplying 1.50 by the Fund s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. Subject to the Incentive Fee Cap (as defined below), the amount of the income based incentive fee that will be paid to the Adviser for a particular quarter will equal the excess of the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as calculated below less the aggregate incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns that were paid to the Adviser in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. 
 The calculation of incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns for each quarter is as follows 
 No incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns shall be payable to the Adviser in any calendar quarter in which the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns for the Trailing Twelve Quarters does not exceed the Preferred Return Amount. 
 100 of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns for the Trailing Twelve Quarters, if any, that exceeds the Preferred Return Amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the Catch-Up Amount determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying 1.82 (7.27 annualized) by the Fund s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Catch-Up Amount is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 15.0 or 17.5 , as applicable, on all of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns when the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns reaches 1.82 per quarter (7.27 annualized) during the Trailing Twelve Quarters. 
 For any quarter in which the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns for the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds the Catch-Up 
 10 

Amount, the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns shall equal 17.5 of the amount of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns for such Trailing Twelve Quarters, as the Preferred Return Amount and Catch-Up Amount will have been achieved. 
 The incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns is subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ). The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 17.5 of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters less (b) the aggregate incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns that were paid to the Adviser in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. For this purpose, Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters means (x) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters less (y) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Fund shall pay no incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns to the Adviser in that quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is a positive value but is less than the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns calculated in accordance with the quarterly calculation above, the Fund shall pay the Adviser the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is equal to or greater than the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns calculated in accordance with quarterly calculation above, the Fund shall pay the Adviser the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns for such quarter. 
 Net Capital Loss in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period. 
 These calculations are prorated for any period of less than three months and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. 
 In no event will the Adviser receive greater cumulative income based incentive fees under this Agreement than it would have under its prior Investment Advisory Agreement by and between the Fund and the Adviser, dated as of October 1, 2018. 
 (2) Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains . The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. 
 The amount payable equals 
 17.5 of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate 
 11 

amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 Solely for purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee after an Exchange Listing, the Fund will be deemed to have previously paid capital gains incentive fees prior to an Exchange Listing equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the actual aggregate amount of previously paid capital gains incentive fees for all periods prior to an Exchange Listing by (b) the percentage obtained by dividing (x) 17.5 by (y) 15 . 
 Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for all prior periods. The Fund will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Fund were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to this Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ), including Section 205 thereof. 
 The fees that are payable under this Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. 
 6. Representations and Warranties . The Adviser represents and warrants that it is duly registered and authorized as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act and the Adviser agrees to maintain effective all material requisite registrations, authorizations and licenses, as the case may be, until the termination of this Agreement. 
 7. Services Not Deemed Exclusive . The Fund and the Board of Trustees acknowledge and agree that 
 (a) the services provided hereunder by the Adviser are not to be deemed exclusive, and the Adviser and any of its affiliates or related persons are free to render similar services to others and to use the research developed in connection with this Agreement for other Advisory Clients or affiliates. The Fund agrees that the Adviser may give advice and take action with respect to any of its other Advisory Clients which may differ from advice given or the timing or nature of action taken with respect to any client or account so long as it is the Adviser s policy, to the extent practicable, to allocate investment opportunities to the client or account on a fair and equitable basis relative to its other Advisory Clients. It is understood that the Adviser shall not have any obligation to recommend for purchase or sale any loans which its principals, affiliates or employees may purchase or sell for its or their own accounts or for any other client or account if, in the opinion of the Investment Adviser, such transaction or investment appears unsuitable, impractical or undesirable for the Fund. Nothing herein shall be construed as constituting the Adviser an agent of the Fund and 
 12 

(b) the Adviser and its affiliates may face conflicts of interest as described in the Fund s Private Placement Memorandum and or the Fund s periodic filings with the SEC (as such disclosures may be updated from time to time) and such disclosures have been provided, and any updates will be provided, to the Board of Trustees in connection with its consideration of this Agreement and any future renewal of this Agreement. 
 8. Limit of Liability . The Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it (the Indemnified Parties shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission or any loss suffered by the Fund in connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates, provided that the Adviser shall not be protected against any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which the Adviser would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations disabling conduct ).

The Indemnified Parties shall not be liable under this Agreement or otherwise for any loss due to the mistake, action, inaction, negligence, dishonesty, fraud or bad faith of any broker or other agent provided, that such broker or other agent shall have been selected, engaged or retained and monitored by the Adviser in good faith, unless such action or inaction was made by reason of disabling conduct, or in the case of a criminal action or proceeding, where the Adviser had reasonable cause to believe its conduct was unlawful. 
 Indemnification shall be made only following (i) a final decision on the merits by a court or other body before which the proceeding was brought that the Indemnified Party was not liable by reason of disabling conduct or (ii) in the absence of such a decision, a reasonable determination, based upon a review of the facts, that the Indemnified Party was not liable by reason of disabling conduct by (a) the vote of a majority of a quorum of trustees of the Fund who are neither interested persons of the Fund nor parties to the proceeding disinterested non-party trustees or (b) an independent legal counsel in a written opinion. 
 An Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advances from the Fund for payment of the reasonable expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by it in connection with the matter as to which it is seeking indemnification in the manner and to the fullest extent permissible under law. Prior to any such advance, the Indemnified Party shall provide to the Fund a written affirmation of its good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Fund has been met and a written undertaking to repay any such advance if it should ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met.

The Sub-Adviser is authorized, for the purchase and sale of the Allocated Portion of the Fund s portfolio securities, to employ such dealers and brokers as may, in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser, implement the policy of the Fund to obtain the best results, taking into account such factors as price, including dealer spread, the size, type and difficulty of the transaction involved, the firm s general execution and operational facilities and the firm s risk in positioning the securities involved. Consistent with this policy, the Sub-Adviser is authorized to direct the execution of the Allocated Portion of the Fund s portfolio transactions to dealers and brokers furnishing statistical information or research deemed by the Sub-Adviser to be useful or valuable to the performance of its investment advisory functions for the Fund.

Information so received will be in addition to and not in lieu of the services required to be performed by the Sub-Adviser. It is understood that the expenses of the Sub-Adviser will not necessarily be reduced as a result of the receipt of such information or research.

However, the Sub-Adviser is under no obligation to aggregate any such orders under any circumstances. 
 5. Remuneration . 
 The Adviser agrees to pay, and the Sub-Adviser agrees to accept, as compensation for the services provided by the Sub-Adviser hereunder, a base management fee and an incentive fee initially paid by the Fund to the Adviser as set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement. The Adviser shall make any payments due hereunder to the Sub-Adviser or to the Sub-Adviser s designee as the Sub-Adviser may otherwise direct. The Adviser shall pay to the Sub-Adviser its pro rata portion of the management fee and the incentive fee described in Exhibit A based on the gross asset value of the Allocated Portion.

 8 

allocate investment opportunities to the client or account on a fair and equitable basis relative to its other Advisory Clients. It is understood that the Sub-Adviser shall not have any obligation to recommend for purchase or sale any loans which its principals, affiliates or employees may purchase or sell for its or their own accounts or for any other client or account if, in the opinion of the Investment Sub-Adviser, such transaction or investment appears unsuitable, impractical or undesirable for the Fund. Nothing herein shall be construed as constituting the Sub-Adviser an agent of the Fund and 
 (b) the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates may face conflicts of interest as described in the Fund s Private Placement Memorandum and or the Fund s periodic filings with the SEC (as such disclosures may be updated from time to time) and such disclosures have been provided, and any updates will be provided, to the Board of Trustees in connection with its consideration of this Agreement and any future renewal of this Agreement. 
 9. Limit of Liability . The Sub-Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it (the Indemnified Parties shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission or any loss suffered by the Fund in connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates, provided that the Sub-Adviser shall not be protected against any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which the Sub-Adviser would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations disabling conduct ).

 Indemnification shall be made only following (i) a final decision on the merits by a court or other body before which the proceeding was brought that the Indemnified Party was not liable by reason of disabling conduct or (ii) in the absence of such a decision, a reasonable determination, based upon a review of the facts, that the Indemnified Party was not liable by reason of disabling conduct by (a) the vote of a majority of a quorum of trustees of the Fund who are neither interested persons of the Fund nor parties to the proceeding disinterested non-party trustees or (b) an independent legal counsel in a written opinion. 
 9

Exhibit A 
 (a) Management Fee. The management fee is paid quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.0 of the average value of the Fund s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. For purposes of this Agreement, gross assets means the Fund s total assets determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), excluding undrawn commitments but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts. 
 (b) Incentive Fee. The incentive fee will consist of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of the Fund s income and a portion is based on a percentage of the Fund s capital gains, each as described below. 
 (i) Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income. The portion based on the Fund s income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Fund receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Fund s operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee). 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Fund has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of 1.5 per quarter (6.0 annualized). 
 The Fund will pay the Adviser, which in turn will pay the Sub-Adviser, an income based incentive fee quarterly in arrears based on the amount by which (x) its aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (such period, the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (y) the Preferred Return Amount (as defined below) in respect of the 

Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Preferred Return Amount will be determined on a quarterly basis, and will be calculated by multiplying 1.50 by the Fund s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. Subject to the Incentive Fee Cap (as defined below), the amount of the income based incentive fee that will be paid to the Adviser for a particular quarter will equal the excess of the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as calculated below less the aggregate incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns that were paid to the Adviser in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. 
 The calculation of incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns for each quarter is as follows 
 No incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns shall be payable to the Adviser in any calendar quarter in which the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns for the Trailing Twelve Quarters does not exceed the Preferred Return Amount. 
 100 of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns for the Trailing Twelve Quarters, if any, that exceeds the Preferred Return Amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the Catch-Up Amount determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying 1.82 (7.27 annualized) by the Fund s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Catch-Up Amount is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 15.0 or 17.5 , as applicable, on all of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns when the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns reaches 1.82 per quarter (7.27 annualized) during the Trailing Twelve Quarters. 
 For any quarter in which the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns for the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds the Catch-Up Amount, the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns shall equal 17.5 of the amount of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns for such Trailing Twelve Quarters, as the Preferred Return Amount and Catch-Up Amount will have been achieved. 
 The incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns is subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ). The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 17.5 of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters less (b) the aggregate incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns that were paid to the Adviser in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. For this purpose, Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters means (x) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters less (y) any Net Capital Loss, 

if any, in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Fund shall pay no incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns to the Adviser in that quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is a positive value but is less than the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns calculated in accordance with the quarterly calculation above, the Fund shall pay the Adviser the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is equal to or greater than the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns calculated in accordance with quarterly calculation above, the Fund shall pay the Adviser the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns for such quarter. 
 Net Capital Loss in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period. 
 These calculations are prorated for any period of less than three months and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. 
 In no event will the Adviser receive greater cumulative income based incentive fees under this Agreement than it would have under its prior Investment Advisory Agreement by and between the Fund and the Adviser, dated as of October 1, 2018. 
 (ii) Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains. The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. 
 The amount payable equals 
 17.5 of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 Solely for purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee after an Exchange Listing, the Fund will be deemed to have previously paid capital gains incentive fees prior to an Exchange Listing equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the actual aggregate amount of previously paid capital gains incentive fees for all periods prior to an Exchange Listing by (b) the percentage obtained by dividing (x) 17.5 by (y) 15 . 
 Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for all prior periods. The Fund will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser, and in turn to the Sub-Adviser, if the Fund were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the capital 

gains incentive fee payable pursuant to this Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, including Section 205 thereof.

Iran Air has historically operated periodic flights to and from Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport as authorized, from time to time, by an aviation-related bilateral agreement between Italy and Iran, scheduled in compliance with European Regulation 95 93, and approved by the Italian Civil Aviation Authority. ADR, as airport operator, is under a mandatory obligation to provide airport services to all air carriers (including Iran Air) authorized by the applicable Italian authority. The relevant turnover attributable to these activities (whose consideration is calculated on the basis of general tariffs determined by such independent Italian authority) in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was less than 100,000.
