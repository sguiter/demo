 Note 1: 
 Liquidity 
 The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Management evaluated whether there are any conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months from the issuance of the accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 As of October 27, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 9, Long-Term Debt). 
 Based on the Company's current amount of debt outstanding and financial projections, management believes the Company will maintain compliance with its financial covenants in the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 9, Long-Term Debt), and that the Company's existing cash, projected operating cash flows and available borrowing capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 9, Long-Term Debt) are adequate to meet its operating needs, liabilities and commitments over the next twelve months from the issuance of the accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 billion (the "Sierra Wireless Acquisition"). The results of operations of Sierra Wireless have been included in the Statements of Operations since the Acquisition Date. 
 The transaction was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, "Business Combinations." The purchase price allocation for the Sierra Wireless Acquisition was completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. The fair values of acquired intangibles were determined based on estimates and assumptions that were deemed reasonable by the Company. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, a preliminary goodwill balance of million was recognized for the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets acquired and represented the expected revenue and cost synergies of the combined company and assembled workforce. During the first three quarters of fiscal year 2024, the Company finalized measurement period adjustments related to identifiable intangible assets, inventories, property, plant, and equipment, income and non-income based taxes, legal matters, and other assets and liabilities, which have been recorded to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the Acquisition Date. These adjustments increased the goodwill balance by million to million. In fiscal year 2024, the Company also finalized its determination of the reporting units related to the Sierra Wireless Acquisition and completed an allocation of the goodwill balance to these reporting units.

Note 3:) ) ) ) Weighted-average shares outstanding basic Weighted-average shares outstanding diluted Loss per share: Basic ) ) ) ) Diluted ) ) ) ) Anti-dilutive shares not included in the above calculations: Share-based compensation Warrants Total anti-dilutive shares 
 Basic earnings or loss per share is computed by dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. 
 Any dilutive effect of the Warrants (as defined in Note 9, Long-Term Debt) is calculated using the treasury-stock method. During the three and nine months ended October 27, 2024, the Warrants were excluded from diluted shares outstanding because the exercise price exceeded the average market price of the Company's common stock for the reporting periods and due to net loss in such reporting periods.

Note 4: 
 Product development and engineering Selling, general and administrative Total share-based compensation 
 Restricted Stock Units, Employees 
 The Company grants restricted stock units to certain employees of which a portion are expected to be settled with shares of the Company's common stock and a portion are expected to be settled in cash. The restricted stock units that are to be settled with shares are accounted for as equity. The grant date for these awards is equal to the measurement date and they are valued as of the measurement date, based on the fair value of the Company's common stock at the grant date, and recognized as share-based compensation expense over the requisite vesting period (typically between and years). The restricted stock units that are to be settled in cash are accounted for as liabilities and the value of the awards is re-measured at the end of each reporting period until settlement at the end of the requisite vesting period (typically years). In the nine months ended October 27, 2024, the Company granted to certain employees restricted stock units that settle in shares with a weighted-average grant date fair value of . 
 Restricted Stock Units, Non-Employee Directors 
 The Company maintains a compensation program pursuant to which restricted stock units are granted to the Company's directors who are not employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Under the Company's director compensation program, a portion of the restricted stock units granted under the program would be settled in cash and a portion would be settled in shares of the Company's common stock. Restricted stock units awarded under the program are generally scheduled to vest on the earlier of (i) after the grant date or (ii) the day immediately preceding the first annual meeting of the Company's stockholders following the grant. The portion of a restricted stock unit award under the program that is to be settled in cash will, subject to vesting, be settled when the director who received the award separates from service. The portion of a restricted stock unit award under the program that is to be settled in shares of stock will, subject to vesting, be settled promptly following vesting. In the nine months ended October 27, 2024, the Company granted to certain non-employee directors restricted stock units that settle in cash and restricted stock units that settle in shares with a weighted-average grant date fair value of . 
 The restricted stock units that are to be settled in cash are accounted for as liabilities. These awards are not typically settled until a non-employee director's separation from service. The value of both the unvested and vested but unsettled awards are re-measured at the end of each reporting period until settlement. In the nine months ended October 27, 2024, million was paid to settle the vesting of cash-settled restricted stock unit awards upon the separation of service of a former director. As of October 27, 2024, the total number of vested, but unsettled, shares subject to cash-settled restricted stock unit awards was and the liability associated with these awards was million, of which million was included in "Accrued liabilities" in the Balance Sheets relating to two previous non-employee directors currently serving short-term non-employee consultancies for the Company. The remaining million was included in "Other long-term liabilities" in the Balance Sheets as of October 27, 2024. As of January 28, 2024, the total number of vested, but unsettled, shares subject to cash-settled restricted stock unit awards was and the liability associated with these awards was million, of which million was included in "Accrued liabilities" in the Balance Sheets relating to two previous non-employee directors currently serving short-term non-employee consultancies for the Company. The remaining million was included in "Other long-term liabilities" in the Balance Sheets as of January 28, 2024. 
 Financial Metric-Based Restricted Stock Units with a Market Condition 
 The Company grants financial metric-based restricted stock units with a market condition (the "Performance Awards") to certain executives of the Company, which are settled in shares and accounted for as equity awards. The Performance Awards have both a financial metric-based performance condition and a pre-defined market condition, which together determine the number of shares that ultimately vest, in addition to the condition of continued service. The number of vested shares for each of the three tranches of the awards, which are the one , two and performance periods, is determined based on the Company's attainment of pre-established revenue and non-GAAP operating income targets for the respective performance period. The vesting for tranches after the initial performance period is dependent on revenue and non-GAAP operating income for the preceding performance period. The market condition is determined based upon the Company's total stockholder return 
 15 

performance period. For fiscal year 2025 grants, the benchmark was against the Russell 3000 Index. The market condition functions as a catch-up provision in determining the vesting of the third tranche of the awards based on the performance over the full performance period. Generally, the award recipients must be employed for the entire performance period and be an active employee at the time of vesting of the awards. 
 The grant-date fair values of the first and second tranches of the Performance Awards are valued using the closing stock price on the grant date and the grant-date fair value of the third tranche of the Performance Awards is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation, which takes into consideration the possible outcomes pertaining to the TSR market condition. The compensation cost of the Performance Awards is recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period based on the number of shares that are probable of attainment for each fiscal year. 
 In the nine months ended October 27, 2024, the Company granted Performance Awards. The weighted-average grant-date fair values for each of the one, two and three-year performance periods over which the Performance Awards vest were , and , respectively. Under the terms of these awards, assuming the highest performance level of with no cancellations due to forfeitures, the maximum potential number of shares that can be earned in aggregate for the cumulative fiscal years 2025, 2026 and 2027 performance periods would be shares. In the nine months ended October 27, 2024, Performance Awards were forfeited due to the terminations of certain officers. 
 Market-Condition Restricted Stock Units, Employees 
 In the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022, the Company granted restricted stock units to certain executives of the Company, which had a pre-defined market condition that determined the number of shares that would ultimately vest. These market-condition restricted stock unit awards ("Market-Condition Awards") were eligible to vest during the period that commenced on March 9, 2021 and ended on March 5, 2024 (the "Performance Period") as follows: the restricted stock units covered by the Market-Condition Awards would vest if, during any consecutive trading day period that commenced and ended during the Performance Period, the average per-share closing price of the Company's common stock equaled or exceeded . The Market-Condition Awards were valued as of the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model and expense was recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, adjusted for any actual forfeitures. The grant-date fair value per unit of the awards granted in fiscal year 2022 was . In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, and , respectively, of the Market-Condition Awards were forfeited due to the terminations of certain officers. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Performance Period ended and the remaining Market-Condition Awards were canceled as the target achievement level was not met.

 During the nine months ended October 27, 2024, the Company had no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3. As of October 27, 2024 and January 28, 2024, the Company had not elected the fair value option for any financial assets and liabilities for which such an election would have been permitted. 
 The convertible debt investments are valued utilizing a combination of estimates that are based on the estimated discounted cash flows associated with the debt and the fair value of the equity into which the debt may be converted, all of which are Level 3 inputs. 
 Sales ) Interest accrued Balance at October 27, 2024 
 The interest rate swap agreements are measured at fair value using readily available interest rate curves (Level 2 inputs). The fair value of each agreement is determined by comparing, for each settlement, the contract rate to the forward rate and discounting to the present value. Contracts in a gain position are recorded in "Other current assets" and "Other assets" in the Balance Sheets and the value of contracts in a loss position are recorded in "Accrued liabilities" and "Other long-term liabilities" in the Balance Sheets. 
 The foreign currency forward contracts are measured at fair value using readily available foreign currency forward and interest rate curves (Level 2 inputs). The fair value of each contract is determined by comparing the contract rate to the forward rate and discounting to the present value. Contracts in a gain position are recorded in "Other current assets" in the Balance Sheets and the value of contracts in a loss position are recorded in "Accrued liabilities" in the Balance Sheets.

 In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, as a result of organizational restructuring, the Company combined the IoT Systems operating segment and the IoT Connected Services operating segment into the newly formed IoT Systems and Connectivity operating segment. There was no change to the reporting units. See Note 15, Segment Information, for further discussion of the Company's operating segments. 
 Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using either a qualitative or quantitative assessment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair market value of the reporting unit. As of October 27, 2024, there was no indication of impairment of the Company's goodwill balances and goodwill impairment was recorded in the nine months ended October 27, 2024. 
 During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, as a result of reduced earnings forecasts associated with the business acquired from Sierra Wireless and macroeconomic conditions, including a rising interest rate environment, the Company performed an interim impairment test using a quantitative assessment of the reporting units related to the Sierra Wireless Acquisition (specifically, the IoT Connected Services, IoT System Modules and IoT System Routers reporting units). The interim impairment test resulted in million of total pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charges recorded in the Statements of Operations during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, consisting of million of goodwill impairment for the IoT Connected Services reporting unit, million of goodwill impairment for the IoT System Modules reporting unit and million goodwill impairment for the IoT System Routers reporting unit. The fair values of these reporting units were determined based on a discounted cash flow model (an income approach) and earnings multiples (a market approach). Significant inputs to the reporting unit fair value measurements included forecasted cash flows, discount rates, terminal growth rates and earnings multiples, which were determined by management estimates and assumptions. The reporting unit fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they involve significant unobservable inputs.

Interest on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility in Alternative Currencies accrues at a rate per annum equal to a customary benchmark rate (including, in certain cases, credit spread adjustments) plus the Applicable Margin. 
 On October 19, 2023, the Company entered into the third amendment (the "Third Amendment") to the Credit Agreement, in order to, among other things, (i) extend the financial covenant relief period by one year to April 30, 2026, (ii) increase the maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant for certain test periods as set forth in the Third Amendment, (iii) reduce the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant for certain test periods as set forth in the Third Amendment and (iv) make certain other changes as set forth therein. These amendments had the effect of extending and temporarily expanding financial covenant relief under the Credit Agreement previously provided for in the First Amendment and Second Amendment. 
 All of the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by all of the Company's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, other than certain excluded subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, any domestic subsidiary the primary assets of which consist of equity or debt of non-U.S. subsidiaries, certain immaterial non-wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and subsidiaries that are prohibited from providing a guarantee under applicable law or that would require governmental approval to provide such guarantee. The Company and the guarantors have also pledged substantially all of their assets to secure their obligations under the Credit Agreement. 
 No amortization is required with respect to the revolving loans. Effective June 6, 2023, in connection with the Second Amendment, the Term Loans amortize (x) during the period that financial covenant relief is in effect (including during the extended covenant relief period provided pursuant to the Third Amendment), in equal quarterly installments of of the aggregate principal amount outstanding on the Third Restatement Effective Date, and (y) otherwise, in equal quarterly installments of of the aggregate principal amount outstanding on the Third Restatement Effective Date, with the balance due at maturity. The Company may voluntarily prepay borrowings at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty, other than customary "breakage costs" in certain circumstances. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company

In addition, the Company must comply with financial covenants which, after effectiveness of the Third Amendment are as follows (in each case, during the covenant relief period): 
 maintaining a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, of (i) to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending on or around October 31, 2023, (ii) to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending on or around January 31, 2024, (iii) to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending on or around April 30, 2024, (iv) to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending on or around July 31, 2024, (v) to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending on or around October 31, 2024, (vi) to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending on or around January 31, 2025, (vii) to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending on or around April 30, 2025, (viii) to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending on or around July 31, 2025, (ix) to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending on or around October 31, 2025, (x) to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending on or around January 31, 2026, and (xi) to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending on or around April 30, 2026 and each fiscal quarter thereafter, subject to increase to to 1.00 for the four full consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or after the date of consummation of a permitted acquisition that constitutes a "Material Acquisition" under the Credit Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions;

 Upon the termination of the covenant relief period under the Third Amendment, the ratio levels set forth above with respect to the leverage and interest expense coverage financial covenants are subject to step-up as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and the liquidity covenant shall no longer apply. 
 Compliance with the leverage and interest expense coverage financial covenants is measured quarterly based upon the Company's performance over the most recent four quarters, and compliance with the liquidity covenant is measured as of the last day of each monthly accounting period. As of October 27, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement. See "Liquidity" in Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation, for additional information about compliance with the financial covenants.

 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2027 
 On October 12, 2022 and October 21, 2022, the Company issued and sold million and million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes") in a private placement. The 2027 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated October 12, 2022, by and among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the "2027 Indenture"). The 2027 Notes are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Company's current and future direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee its borrowings under its Credit Agreement. The 2027 Notes bear interest at a rate of per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2023. The 2027 Notes will mature on November 1, 2027, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. 
 The initial conversion rate of the 2027 Notes is 26.8325 shares of the Company's common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the 2027 Indenture but will not be adjusted for accrued 
 26 

trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the business day period after any consecutive trading day period in which, for each trading day of that period, the Trading Price (as defined in the 2027 Indenture), as determined following a request by a holder of the 2027 Notes in accordance with the procedures described in the 2027 Indenture, per 1,000 principal amount of the 2027 Notes for such trading day was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls such 2027 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the 2027 Notes called (or deemed called as provided in the 2027 Indenture) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events described in the 2027 Indenture. As of October 27, 2024, none of the conditions allowing holders of the 2027 Notes to convert had been met. On or after July 1, 2027 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2027 Notes, holders of the 2027 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2027 Notes, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, the 2027 Notes will be settled in cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be converted, and in cash, shares of the Company's common stock or any combination thereof, at the Company's option, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company's conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes being converted. 
 The Company may not redeem the 2027 Notes prior to November 5, 2025. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Notes (subject to the limitation described below), at the Company's option, on or after November 5, 2025 and before the st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides the related notice of sale price redemption, at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company redeems less than all the outstanding 2027 Notes, at least million aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the relevant redemption notice date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2027 Notes. 
 Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (as defined in the 2027 Indenture) prior to the maturity date of the 2027 Notes, holders of the 2027 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2027 Notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (as defined in the 2027 Indenture). 
 Convertible Note Hedge Transactions 
 On October 6, 2022 and October 19, 2022, the Company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the "Convertible Note Hedge Transactions") with an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers of the 2027 Notes and another financial institution (collectively, the "Counterparties") whereby the Company has the option to purchase the same number of shares of the Company's common stock initially underlying the 2027 Notes in the aggregate for approximately per share, which is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those in the 2027 Notes. The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions will expire upon the maturity of the 2027 Notes, if not earlier exercised. The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to the common stock upon the conversion of the 2027 Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2027 Notes, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of common stock, as measured under the terms of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions, is greater than the strike price of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions, which initially corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2027 Notes, or approximately per share of the common stock. The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions are separate transactions, entered into by the Company with each of the Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the 2027 Notes. Holders of the 2027 Notes do not have any rights with respect to the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions. The Company used approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2027 Notes to pay the cost of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions. The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions are recorded in additional paid- 
 27 

million shares of the Company's common stock at an initial strike price of approximately per share. The Warrants were sold in private placements to the Counterparties pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. If the market price per share of the common stock, as measured under the terms of the Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, the Warrants could have a dilutive effect on the common stock, unless the Company elects, subject to certain conditions, to settle the Warrants in cash. The Warrants will expire over a period beginning in February 2028. 
 The Warrants are separate transactions, entered into by the Company with each of the Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the 2027 Notes. Holders of the 2027 Notes do not have any rights with respect to the Warrants. The Company received aggregate proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the Warrants to the Counterparties. The Warrants are recorded in additional paid-in capital in the Balance Sheets as they do not require classification outside of equity pursuant to ASC 480 and qualify for equity classification pursuant to ASC 815. 
 In combination, the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and the Warrants are intended to synthetically increase the strike price of the conversion option of the 2027 Notes from approximately to (subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the agreements governing such transactions), with the expected result of reducing the dilutive effect of the 2027 Notes in exchange for a net cash premium of million. 
 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2028 
 On October 26, 2023, the Company issued and sold million in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the "2028 Notes") in a private placement. The 2028 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated October 26, 2023, by and among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the "2028 Indenture"). The 2028 Notes are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Company's current and future direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee its borrowings under its Credit Agreement. The 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2024. The 2028 Notes will mature on November 1, 2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. As of October 27, 2024, approximately million of the 2028 Notes remained outstanding. 
 The initial conversion rate of the 2028 Notes is 49.0810 shares of the Company's common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2028 Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the 2028 Indenture but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the 2028 Indenture) or if the Company delivers a Notice of Redemption (as defined in the 2028 Indenture), the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock as described in the 2028 Indenture for a holder who elects to convert its 2028 Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change or to convert its 2028 Notes called (or deemed called as provided in the 2028 Indenture) for redemption in connection with such Notice of Redemption, as the case may be. 
 Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 1, 2028, the 2028 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders thereof only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ended on January 28, 2024 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the business day period after any consecutive trading day period in which, for each trading day of that period, the Trading Price (as defined in the 2028 Indenture), as determined following a request by a holder of the 2028 Notes in accordance with the procedures described in the Indenture, per 1,000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes for such trading day was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls such 2028 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the 2028 Notes called (or deemed called as provided in the 2028 Indenture) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events described in the 2028 Indenture. As of October 27, 2024, one of the conditions allowing the holders of the 2028 Notes to convert had been met. The trading price of the Company's common stock remained above of the applicable conversion price for at least trading days during the consecutive-trading day period ending on, and including October 25, 2024 (the last trading day of the fiscal quarter ended October 27, 2024) resulting in the 
 28 

of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides the related notice of sale price redemption, at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company redeems less than all the outstanding 2028 Notes, at least million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the relevant redemption notice date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2028 Notes. 
 Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (as defined in the 2028 Indenture) prior to the maturity date of the 2028 Notes, holders of the 2028 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2028 Notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (as defined in the 2028 Indenture). 
 Exchange of 2028 Notes 
 On July 11, 2024 and July 15, 2024, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements (the Exchange Agreements with certain holders of the 2028 Notes. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, on July 24, 2024 certain holders exchanged with the Company approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes held by them for an aggregate of shares of the Company's common stock, which number of shares was determined over an averaging period that commenced on July 12, 2024. The Company accounted for these exchange transactions as a partial debt extinguishment and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt equal to the difference between the fair value of the Company's common stock delivered to certain holders of the 2028 Notes and the carrying value of the outstanding debt, accrued interest and third-party fees related to the Exchange Agreements. In the nine months ended October 27, 2024, in connection with the exchange transactions, the Company recognized million of loss included in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the Statements of Operations and million of loss resulting from the write-off of deferred financing costs included in "Interest expense" in the Statements of Operations.

 Included in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits at October 27, 2024 and January 28, 2024 are million and million, respectively, of net tax benefits (after the federal impact of state items), that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate, prior to consideration of any required valuation allowance. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 due to expiration of a statute of limitations. 
 Other long-term liabilities Total accrued taxes 
 Tax years prior to 2013 (the Company's fiscal year 2014) are generally not subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service except for items involving tax attributes that have been carried forward to tax years whose statute of limitations remains open. For state returns in the U.S., the Company is generally not subject to income tax examinations for calendar years prior to 2012 (the Company's fiscal year 2013). The Company has a significant tax presence in Switzerland for which Swiss tax filings have been examined through fiscal year 2020. The Company is also subject to routine examinations by various foreign tax jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company's tax examinations are resolved in a manner not consistent with the Company's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.

 On June 14, 2022, Denso Corporation, and several of its affiliates (collectively "Denso"), filed a complaint against Sierra Wireless and several of its affiliates ("Sierra Entities") in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego. Denso asserted eight causes of action, including claims for breach of express and implied warranties, equitable indemnification, negligent and intentional misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, and declaratory judgment, based on an alleged defect related to the GPS week number rollover date. Denso alleged that it incurred in excess of million in damages and costs to implement a firmware update provided by Sierra Entities' supplier in late 2018, before Sierra Wireless disposed of the automotive business, to address the alleged product defect. Denso filed an amended complaint on September 23, 2022, asserting essentially the same eight causes of action. After briefing on a demurrer and initial discovery, the parties' reached a settlement agreement on September 18, 2023 with payments to Denso to be made in four quarterly installments. The final installment payment was made in June 2024 and the case was dismissed with prejudice. 
 On March 25, 2022, Harman Becker Automotive Systems GmbH, and several of its affiliates (collectively "Harman"), filed a complaint against certain Sierra Entities in the District Court of Munich, Germany. Harman asserted claims that the Sierra Entities, in connection with the delivery of certain modules by the Sierra Entities, violated a frame supply agreement, a quality assurance agreement and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods. Harman alleged that it incurred approximately million in damages and costs, the bulk of which amount related to settling with a customer that had to implement a firmware update provided by Sierra Entities' supplier in late 2018, before Sierra Wireless disposed of the automotive business, to address the alleged product defect. At this stage, the Company is unable to form a conclusion as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or an estimate of the amount or range of any possible loss resulting from the alleged claims. The Company intends to defend the claims vigorously. 
 Environmental Matters 
 The Company vacated a former facility in Newbury Park, California in 2002, but continues to address groundwater and soil contamination at the site. The Company's efforts to address site conditions have been at the direction of the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board ("RWQCB"). In October 2013, an order was issued including a scope of proposed additional site work, monitoring, and remediation activities. The Company has been complying with RWQCB orders and 
 direction, and continues to implement an approved remedial action plan addressing the soil, groundwater, and soil vapor at the site. 
 The Company has accrued liabilities where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Based on the latest determinations by the RWQCB and the most recent actions taken pursuant to the remedial action plan, the Company estimates the total range of probable loss to be between million and million. To date, the Company has made million in payments towards the remedial action plan. As of October 27, 2024, the estimated range of probable loss remaining was between million and million. Given the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and the remediation activities, the Company is unable to determine a best estimate within the range of loss. Therefore, the Company has recorded the minimum amount of probable loss and as of October 27, 2024, has a remaining accrual of million related to this matter. These estimates could change as a result of changes in planned remedial actions, further actions from the regulatory agency, remediation technology, and other factors. 
 Indemnification 
 The Company has entered into agreements with its current and former executives and directors indemnifying them against certain liabilities incurred in connection with the performance of their duties. The Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws also contain indemnification obligations with respect to the Company's current directors and employees. 
 The Company is a party to a variety of agreements in the ordinary course of business under which the Company may be obligated to indemnify a third party with respect to certain matters. The impact on the Company's future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of any claims and whether claims will be made. 
 Product Warranties 
 Deferred Compensation 
 The Company maintains a deferred compensation plan for certain officers and key executives that allows participants to defer a portion of their compensation for future distribution at various times permitted by the plan. This plan provides for a discretionary Company match up to a defined portion of the employee's deferral, with any match subject to a defined vesting schedule. 
 Other long-term liabilities Total deferred compensation liabilities under this plan 
 The Company has purchased whole life insurance on the lives of certain current deferred compensation plan participants. This corporate-owned life insurance is held in a grantor trust and is intended to cover a majority of the Company's costs of the deferred compensation plan.

 Outside Subcontractors and Suppliers 
 The Company relies on a limited number of third-party subcontractors and suppliers for the supply of silicon wafers, chipsets and other electronic components, and for product manufacturing, packaging, testing and certain other tasks. Disruption or termination of supply sources or subcontractors have delayed and could in the future delay shipments and could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Although there are generally alternate sources for these materials and services, qualification of the alternate sources could cause delays sufficient to have a material adverse effect on the Company. A significant amount of the Company's third-party subcontractors and suppliers, including third-party foundries that supply silicon wafers, are located in the U.S., China, and Taiwan. A significant amount of the Company's assembly and test operations are conducted by third-party contractors in China, Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan, and Vietnam.

 Overview 
 Semtech Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the "Company," "we," "our" or "us") is a high-performance, semiconductor, Internet of Things ("IoT") systems and cloud connectivity service provider. We have three operating segments Signal Integrity, Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless, and IoT Systems and Connectivity that represent three separate reportable segments. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company had four operating segments Signal Integrity, Advanced Protection and Sensing, IoT Systems and IoT Connected Services. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, as a result of organizational restructuring, the wireless business, which was previously included in the former IoT Systems operating segment, and the software defined video over ethernet business, which was previously included in the Signal Integrity operating segment, were moved into the Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless operating segment, formerly the Advanced Protection and Sensing operating segment, which also includes the proximity sensing, power and protection businesses. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, as a result of organizational restructuring, the Company combined the IoT Systems operating segment and the IoT Connected Services operating segment into the newly formed IoT Systems and Connectivity operating segment. As a result of the reorganization, the Company has three reportable segments. All prior year information in the tables below has been revised retrospectively to reflect the change to the Company's reportable segments. See Part I, Item 1, Note 15, Segment Information, to our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on our reportable segments. 
 Signal Integrity. We design, develop, manufacture and market a portfolio of optical and copper data communications and video transport products used in a wide variety of infrastructure and industrial applications. Our comprehensive portfolio includes integrated circuits ("ICs") for data centers, enterprise networks, passive optical networks ("PON"), and wireless base station optical transceivers.

 Recent Developments 
 Convertible Note Exchange 
 On July 11, 2024 and July 15, 2024, we entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements (the "Exchange Agreements") with certain holders of our 4.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the "2028 Notes"). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, on July 24, 2024 certain holders exchanged with us approximately 188.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes held by them for an aggregate of 10,378,431 shares of our common stock, which number of shares was determined over an averaging period that commenced on July 12, 2024. We accounted for these exchange transactions as a partial debt extinguishment and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt equal to the difference between the fair value of our common stock delivered to certain holders of the 2028 Notes and the carrying value of the outstanding debt, accrued interest and third-party fees related to the Exchange Agreements. In the nine months ended October 27, 2024, in connection with the exchange transactions, we recognized 144.7 million of loss included in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the Statements of Operations and 5.5 million of loss resulting from the write-off of deferred financing costs included in "Interest expense" in the Statements of Operations. 
 Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions 
 In recent periods, macroeconomic factors such as market volatility, inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates, geopolitical tensions and recessionary concerns have caused uncertainty in end customer demand, which resulted in elevated channel inventories. We believe that we can continue to take appropriate actions to align our inventory levels with anticipated customer demand profiles. 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Most of our sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders and many customers include cancellation provisions in their purchase orders. We rely on orders received and shipped within the same quarter for a meaningful portion of our sales. Net sales made through independent distributors during the third quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were each 72 of net sales and the remainder were made directly to customers. 
 We are a global business with customers and suppliers around the world. A significant amount of our third-party subcontractors and suppliers, including third-party foundries that supply silicon wafers, are located outside the United States, including China and Taiwan. A significant amount of our assembly and test operations are conducted by third-party contractors located outside the United States, including China, Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan and Vietnam. Net sales outside the United States constituted 
 42 

79 and 78 during the third quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Approximately 63 and 59 of our net sales during the third quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, were to customers located in the Asia-Pacific region. We are subject to export restrictions and trade regulations, which have limited our ability to sell to certain customers in certain regions. 
 We use several metrics as indicators of future potential growth. The indicators that we believe best correlate to potential future sales growth are design wins and new product releases. There are many factors that may cause a design win or new product release to not result in sales, including a customer's decision not to go to system production, a change in a customer's perspective regarding a product's value or a customer's product failing in the end market. As a result, although a design win or new product introduction is an important step towards generating future sales, it does not necessarily result in us being awarded business or receiving a purchase commitment. 
 Inflationary factors have in the past affected, and could continue to affect, our performance if we are unable to pass higher costs on to our customers.

 Net sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, benefited from stronger demand and increased sales volumes in the Signal Integrity and Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless reportable segments. Net sales from Signal Integrity increased 24.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by a 18.8 million increase in data center sales, a 4.5 million increase in telecommunications sales and a 1.2 million increase in broadcast sales. Net sales from Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless increased 12.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by a 13.5 million increase in LoRa-enabled product sales, partially offset by a 1.0 million decrease in Pro-AV product sales. Net sales from IoT Systems and Connectivity decreased 1.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 primarily driven by a 1.4 million decrease in IoT Hardware sales.

Gross Profit 
 The following table summarizes our gross profit and gross margin by reportable segment: 
 Three Months Ended October 27, 2024 October 29, 2023 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Profit Gross Margin Gross Profit Gross Margin Signal Integrity 45,123 63.1 24,368 51.6 Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless 
 47,355 57.2 35,469 50.5 IoT Systems and Connectivity 33,831 41.0 42,469 50.9 Unallocated costs, including share-based compensation and amortization of acquired technology (5,341) (9,340) Total 120,968 51.1 92,966 46.3 
 In the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, gross profit increased 28.0 million to 121.0 million from 93.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. This increase was primarily driven by a 20.8 million increase from Signal Integrity, which experienced higher sales led by data center and 10G PON due to stronger demand, a 11.9 million increase from Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless, which experienced higher sales led by LoRa-enabled product due to stronger demand, a 7.7 million decrease in the amortization of acquired technology intangible assets related to the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Sierra Wireless, Inc. on January 12, 2023 (the "Sierra Wireless Acquisition") due to impairments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, partially offset by a 8.6 million decrease from IoT Systems and Connectivity due to royalty expense recoveries in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. 
 Our gross margin was 51.1 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, compared to 46.3 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 . Gross margin for our Signal Integrity segment was 63.1 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 , compared to 51.6 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, primarily due to higher volume reducing overhead. Gross margin for our Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless segment was 57.2 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 , compared to 50.5 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 , primarily due to higher overhead absorption and favorable product mix. Gross margin for our IoT Systems and Connectivity segment was 41.0 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 , compared to 50.9 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, primarily due to royalty expense recoveries in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. 
 Operating Expenses, net 
 The following table summarizes our operating expenses, net: 
 Three Months Ended Change (in thousands, except percentages) October 27, 2024 October 29, 2023 Product development and engineering 42,563 41 46,911 45 (9) Selling, general and administrative 59,777 58 47,663 45 25 Intangible amortization 148 4,853 5 (97) Restructuring 695 1 3,646 3 (81) Goodwill impairment 2,266 2 (100) Total operating expenses, net 103,183 100 105,339 100 (2) 
 Product Development and Engineering Expenses 
 Product development and engineering expenses decreased 4.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 primarily as a result of a 6.3 million decrease in new product introduction expenses and a 0.5 million decrease in facilities expenses, partially offset by a 2.5 million net increase in staffing-related costs, which reflects higher supplemental compensation. The levels of product development and engineering expenses reported in a fiscal period can be significantly impacted, and therefore experience period over period volatility, by the number of new product tape-outs and by the timing of recoveries from engineering services, which are typically recorded as a reduction to product development and engineering expense. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 12.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 primarily as a result of a 13.9 million net increase in staffing-related costs, which reflects higher share-based and supplemental compensation, a 0.8 million increase in litigation expenses, and a 0.5 million increase in depreciation, partially offset by a decrease of 2.7 million in transaction and integration costs primarily related to the Sierra Wireless Acquisition. 
 45 

Intangible Amortization 
 Intangible amortization decreased by 4.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to impairment of intangible assets acquired in the Sierra Wireless Acquisition related to customer relationships and trade name in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. The amortization of acquired technology intangible assets is reflected in cost of sales. 
 Restructuring 
 Restructuring decreased by 3.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to the structural reorganization actions primarily in the prior year period to reduce our workforce as a result of cost-saving measures and internal resource alignment including from the realization of synergies of the Sierra Wireless Acquisition. 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 There was no goodwill impairment in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to 2.3 million of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to valuation adjustments of goodwill related to the Sierra Wireless Acquisition. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense, including amortization and a write-off of deferred financing costs, was 20.8 million and 28.3 million for the third quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to interest savings as a result of approximately 188.1 million of 2028 Notes extinguished in exchange for common stock in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. 
 Investment Impairments and Credit Loss Reserves, Net 
 During the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, we did not record any investment impairments and credit loss reserves. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, investment impairments and credit loss reserves, net totaled a loss of 2.0 million due to adjustments to our credit loss reserve for our available-for-sale debt securities. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 We recorded income tax expense of 4.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, compared to income tax benefit of 0.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. The change in our tax provision for the three months ended October 27, 2024, compared to the three months ended October 29, 2023 was primarily due to a regional mix of income, nondeductible loss on extinguishment of debt and changes in valuation allowance. The effective tax rates in the third quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 primarily due to a regional mix of income, changes in valuation allowance, impact of global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI"), research and development ("R D") credits and nondeductible loss on extinguishment of debt. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") requires R D costs incurred for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021 to be capitalized and amortized ratably over five or fifteen years for tax purposes, depending on where the research activities are conducted. We have elected to treat GILTI as a period cost and the additional capitalization of R D costs within GILTI increases our provision for income taxes. 
 We receive a tax benefit from a tax holiday that was granted in Switzerland. The tax holiday commenced on January 30, 2017, and was effective for five years (the "Initial Term"). Since we met certain staffing targets, the holiday has been extended for an additional five years commencing on January 31, 2022. The maximum benefit under this tax holiday is CHF 500.0 million of cumulative after tax profit, which equates to a maximum potential tax savings of CHF 44.0 million. The extended term of the tax holiday is effective until fiscal year 2027. However, Switzerland implemented the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development's ("OECD") global minimum tax ("Pillar Two") rules effective from January 1, 2024. Based on the administrative guidance issued by OECD in December 2023, we have determined that Pillar Two rules are applicable in the current fiscal year; therefore, we do not benefit from the tax holiday. 
 As a global organization, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. To the extent that an audit, or the closure of a statute of limitations, results in adjusting our reserves for uncertain tax positions, our effective tax rate could experience extreme volatility since any adjustment would be recorded as a discrete item in the period of adjustment. 
 For further information on the effective tax rate and the Tax Act's impact, see Note 10, Income Taxes, to our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 
 Net Sales 
 The following table summarizes our net sales by major end market: 
 Nine Months Ended October 27, 2024 October 29, 2023 (in thousands, except percentages) Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Change Infrastructure 174,720 27 124,560 18 40 High-End Consumer 111,638 17 93,163 14 20 Industrial 371,927 56 458,087 68 (19) Total 658,285 100 675,810 100 (3) 
 Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 were 658.3 million, a decrease of 2.6 compared to 675.8 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 primarily driven by lower net sales from our industrial end market related to decreased sales volume and pricing pressures, offset by higher demand. Comparing the same periods, our infrastructure and high-end consumer end markets had stronger demand and resulting net sales. Net sales from our infrastructure end market increased 50.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by a 34.2 million increase in data center sales and a 20.9 million increase in telecommunications sales, partially offset by a 5.0 million decrease in TVS infrastructure product sales. Net sales from our high-end consumer end market increased 18.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by a 19.2 million increase in TVS consumer product sales and a 4.7 million increase in proximity sensing sales, partially offset by a 4.2 million decrease in LoRa-enabled sales in consumer applications. Net sales from our industrial end market decreased 86.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by a 110.9 million decrease in IoT Hardware sales and a 3.9 million decrease in TVS industrial product sales, partially offset by a 30.2 million increase in LoRa-enabled sales in industrial applications. 
 The following table summarizes our net sales by reportable segment: 
 
 Nine Months Ended October 27, 2024 October 29, 2023 (in thousands, except percentages) Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Change Signal Integrity 189,242 29 134,202 20 41 Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless 237,484 36 199,841 30 19 IoT Systems and Connectivity 231,559 35 341,767 50 (32) Total 658,285 100 675,810 100 (3) 
 Net sales in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, were impacted by softer demand in the IoT Systems and Connectivity reportable segment, which contributed to lower sales volume and pricing pressures, but benefited from stronger demand in the Signal Integrity and Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless reportable segments. Net sales from Signal Integrity increased 55.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by a 34.2 million increase in data center sales and a 20.9 million increase in telecommunications sales. Net sales from Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless increased 37.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by a 26.0 million increase in LoRa-enabled sales, a 10.2 million increase in TVS product sales, and a 4.7 million increase in proximity sensing sales. Net sales from IoT Systems and Connectivity decreased 110.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by a 110.9 million decrease in IoT Hardware sales, partially offset by a 0.6 million increase in managed connectivity sales.

Gross Profit 
 The following table summarizes our gross profit and gross margin by reportable segment: 
 Nine Months Ended October 27, 2024 October 29, 2023 (in thousands, except percentages) Gross Profit Gross Margin Gross Profit Gross Margin Signal Integrity 116,652 61.6 76,461 57.0 Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless 133,458 56.2 115,066 57.6 IoT Systems and Connectivity 88,036 38.0 143,626 42.0 Unallocated costs, including share-based compensation (12,122) (38,513) Total 326,024 49.5 296,640 43.9 
 In the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, gross profit increased 29.4 million to 326.0 million from 296.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. This increase was primarily driven by a 40.2 million increase from Signal Integrity, which experienced higher sales led by data center and 10G PON due to stronger demand, a 24.6 million decrease in the amortization of acquired technology intangible assets related to the Sierra Wireless Acquisition due to impairments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, a 18.4 million increase from Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless, which experienced higher sales due to stronger demand, particularly with TVS consumer products, a 3.3 million decrease for amortization of inventory step-up due to the finalization of measurement period adjustments in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 related to the Sierra Wireless Acquisition, partially offset by a 55.6 million decrease from IoT Systems and Connectivity due to lower IoT Hardware sales primarily driven by soft demand causing decreased sales volume and pricing pressures. 
 Our gross margin was 49.5 in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, compared to 43.9 in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 . Gross margin from Signal Integrity was 61.6 in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 , compared to 57.0 in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily due to higher volume reducing overhead . Gross margin from Analog Mixed Signal and Wireless was 56.2 in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 , compared to 57.6 in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily due to higher overhead and price erosion. Gross margin from IoT Systems and Connectivity was 38.0 in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, compared to 42.0 in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by softer demand and pricing pressures. 
 Operating Expenses, net 
 Nine Months Ended Change (in thousands, except percentages) October 27, 2024 October 29, 2023 Product development and engineering 124,251 42 144,945 23 (14) Selling, general and administrative 167,835 56 165,022 28 2 Intangible amortization 737 14,606 2 (95) Restructuring 4,505 2 14,608 2 (69) Goodwill impairment 281,821 45 (100) Total operating expenses, net 297,328 100 621,002 100 (52) 
 Product Development and Engineering Expenses 
 Product development and engineering expenses decreased 20.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 primarily as a result of a 10.0 million decrease in new product introduction expenses, a 9.5 million net decrease in staffing-related costs due to lower headcount and a 2.3 million decrease in facilities expenses, partially offset by a 1.6 million reduction in tax credits. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 primarily as a result of a 12.7 million net increase in staffing related costs, which reflects higher share-based and other supplemental compensation offset by lower headcount from restructuring, a 3.0 million increase in consulting expenses, a 2.0 million increase in depreciation and a 1.2 million increase in bad debt expense, partially offset by a 13.7 million decrease in transaction and integration expenses primarily related to the Sierra Wireless Acquisition and a 1.0 million reduction in travel expenses. 
 48 

Intangible Amortization 
 Intangible amortization decreased by 13.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2024 due to impairment of intangible assets acquired in the Sierra Wireless Acquisition related to customer relationships and trade name in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. The amortization of acquired technology intangible assets is reflected in cost of sales. 
 Restructuring 
 Restructuring decreased by 10.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2024 primarily due to structural reorganization actions primarily in the prior year period to reduce our workforce as a result of cost-saving measures and internal resource alignment including from the realization of synergies of the Sierra Wireless Acquisition. 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 There was no goodwill impairment for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to 281.8 million of goodwill impairment for the same period in fiscal year 2024 due to valuation adjustments of goodwill related to the Sierra Wireless Acquisition. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense, including amortization and write-off of deferred financing costs, remained relatively consistent at 72.6 million and 73.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 In addition to the write-off of 5.5 million of deferred financing costs as a result of approximately 188.1 million of 2028 Notes extinguished in exchange for common stock in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, which was recorded in "Interest expense" in the Statements of Operations, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt equal to the difference between the fair value of our common stock delivered to certain holders of the 2028 Notes and the carrying value of the outstanding debt, accrued interest and third-party fees related to the Exchange Agreements. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, in connection with the exchange transactions, we recognized 144.7 million of loss included in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the Statements of Operations. 
 Investment Impairments and Credit Loss Reserves, Net 
 During the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, investment impairments and credit loss reserves, net totaled a loss of 1.1 million due to an other-than-temporary impairment on one of our non-marketable equity investments. During the first nine months of 2024, investment impairments and credit loss reserves, net totaled a loss of 2.3 million due to adjustments to our credit loss reserve for our available-for-sale debt securities. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 In the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, we recorded income tax expense of 11.2 million, compared to income tax expense of 53.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. The change in our tax provision for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 was primarily due to a regional mix of income, nondeductible loss on extinguishment of debt and changes in valuation allowance. The effective tax rates in the first nine months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 primarily due to a regional mix of income, changes in valuation allowance, non-deductibility of goodwill impairment, impact of GILTI, R D credits and nondeductible loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recorded a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately 52.8 million. We are required to assess whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against our deferred tax assets ("DTAs") based on the consideration of all available evidence, using a "more likely than not" realization standard. The four sources of taxable income that must be considered in determining whether DTAs will be realized are: (1) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences (i.e. offset of gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities); (2) taxable income in prior carryback years, if carryback is permitted under the tax law; (3) tax planning strategies; and (4) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. 
 After a review of the four sources of taxable income described above and in view of our three-year cumulative loss, we were not able to conclude that it is more likely than not that our DTAs will be realized. As a result, we recorded an additional valuation allowance on our DTAs, with a corresponding charge to our income tax provision, of approximately 52.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base; the success, timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market; sales growth or decline; potential acquisitions or divestitures; the general economic environment in which we operate; and our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities. 
 We believe that our cash on hand, cash available from future operations and available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) are sufficient to meet liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, including funds needed for our material cash requirements. As of October 27, 2024, we had 136.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and 287.2 million of available undrawn borrowing capacity on our Revolving Credit Facility, subject to net leverage limitations and customary conditions precedent, including the accuracy of representations and warranties and the absence of defaults. Over the longer-term, we expect to fund our business using cash flows from operating activities. 
 As of October 27, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement (as defined below). Based on our current amount of debt outstanding and financial projections, management believes we will maintain compliance with our financial covenants and that our existing cash, projected operating cash flows and available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility are adequate to meet our operating needs, liabilities and commitments over the next twelve months from the issuance of the accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 As of October 27, 2024 and January 28, 2024, there was 2.9 million outstanding under the letters of credit, swing line loans and alternative currency sub-facilities outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 A meaningful portion of our capital resources, and the liquidity they represent, are held by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. As of October 27, 2024, our foreign subsidiaries held 119.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to 104.6 million at January 28, 2024. Our liquidity may be impacted by fluctuating exchange rates. For additional information on exchange rates, see Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 In connection with the enactment of the Tax Act, all historic and current foreign earnings are taxed in the U.S. Depending on the jurisdiction, these foreign earnings are potentially subject to a withholding tax, if repatriated. As of October 27, 2024, our historical undistributed earnings prior to fiscal year 2023 of our foreign subsidiaries are intended to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. With the enactment of the Tax Act, which amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, all post-1986 previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued were subject to U.S. tax. As a result of the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we have determined that none of the foreign earnings from fiscal year 2023 onward will be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. If we needed to remit all or a portion of our historical undistributed earnings to the U.S. for investment in our domestic operations, any such remittance could result in increased tax liabilities and a higher effective tax rate. Determination of the amount of the unrecognized potential deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable. 
 We expect our future non-operating uses of cash will be for capital expenditures and debt repayment . We expect to fund these cash requirements through cash flows from operating activities. 
 Credit Agreement 
 On September 26, 2022 (the "Third Restatement Effective Date"), we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") with the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer. 
 As of October 27, 2024, the borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement (the "Revolving Credit Facility") is 500.0 million, of which 162.5 million matured on November 7, 2024 and 337.5 million is scheduled to mature on January 12, 2028 (subject to, in certain circumstances, an earlier springing maturity), and the term loans thereunder (the "Term Loans") are scheduled to mature on January 12, 2028 (subject to, in certain circumstances, an earlier springing maturity). 
 As of October 27, 2024, we had 622.6 million outstanding under the Term Loans and 210.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, which had available undrawn borrowing capacity of 287.2 million, subject to net leverage limitations and customary conditions precedent, including the accuracy of representations and warranties and the absence of defaults. 
 Up to 40.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility may be used to obtain letters of credit, up to 25.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility may be used to obtain swing line loans, and up to 75.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility may be used to obtain revolving loans and letters of credit in certain currencies other than U.S. Dollars. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility may be used by us for capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, permitted dividends, working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 50 

As of October 27, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in our Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains customary provisions pertaining to events of default. If any event of default occurs, the obligations under the Credit Agreement may be declared due and payable, terminated upon written notice to us and existing letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized. 
 See Note 9, Long-Term Debt to our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the terms of the Credit Agreement. 
 We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability of interest payments on debt outstanding under the Term Loans. See Note 17, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, to our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2027 
 On October 6, 2022 and October 21, 2022, we issued and sold 300.0 million and 19.5 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of 1.625 Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes") in a private placement. The 2027 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated October 12, 2022, by and among us, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2027 Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.625 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2023. The 2027 Notes will mature on November 1, 2027, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The 2027 Notes are not currently redeemable and, as of April 28, 2024, none of the conditions allowing holders of the 2027 Notes to convert had been met. The 2027 Notes were initially issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
 We used approximately 72.6 million of the net proceeds from the 2027 Notes to pay for the cost of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions, after such cost was partially offset by approximately 42.9 million of proceeds to us from the sale of Warrants in connection with the issuance of the 2027 Notes, all as defined and described in Note 9, Long-Term Debt to our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and Warrants transactions are indexed to, and potentially settled in, our common stock and the net cost of 29.7 million has been recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity (deficit). We used the remaining net proceeds to fund a portion of the consideration in the Sierra Wireless Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. For additional information on the 2027 Notes, Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and the Warrants, see Note 9, Long-Term Debt to our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2028 
 On October 26, 2023, we issued and sold 250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes in a private placement. The 2028 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated October 26, 2023, by and among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.00 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2024. The 2028 Notes will mature on November 1, 2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. As of October 27, 2024, approximately 62.0 million of the 2028 Notes remained outstanding. The 2028 Notes were offered and sold only to eligible purchasers who are both "qualified institutional buyers" within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act and "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act, in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act. 
 The 2028 Notes are not currently redeemable. The 2028 Notes may be converted at the option of the holders at the times and under the circumstances and at the conversion rate described in Note 9, Long-Term Debt, to our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As of October 27, 2024, one of the conditions allowing holders of the 2028 Notes to convert had been met. The trading price of our common stock remained above 130 of the applicable 20.37 conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on, and including, October 25, 2024 (the last trading day of the quarter ended October 27, 2024), resulting in the right of the holders of the 2028 Notes to convert their 2028 Notes beginning October 28, 2024 through January 24, 2025 (the last trading day of the quarter ending January 26, 2025). If converted, we will settle in cash the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be converted, and for the remainder of the conversion obligations in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted, we will settle the obligations in either cash, shares of our common stock, or any combination thereof, at our option. 
 On July 11, 2024 and July 15, 2024, we entered into the Exchange Agreements with certain holders of the 2028 Notes. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, certain holders of the 2028 Notes exchanged with us approximately 188.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes held by them for an aggregate of 10,378,431 shares of our common stock, which number of shares was determined over an averaging period that commenced on July 12, 2024. We accounted for these exchange transactions as a partial debt extinguishment and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt equal to the difference between the fair value of our common stock delivered to certain holders of the 2028 Notes and the carrying value of the outstanding debt, accrued interest and third-party fees related to the Exchange Agreements. In the nine months ended October 27, 2024, in 
 51 

connection with the exchange transactions, we recognized 144.7 million of loss included in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the Statements of Operations and 5.5 million of loss resulting from the write-off of deferred financing costs included in "Interest expense" in the Statements of Operations. 
 For additional information on the 2028 Notes, see Note 9, Long-Term Debt to our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Capital Expenditures and Research and Development 
 We incur significant expenditures in order to fund the development, design and manufacture of new products. We intend to continue to focus on those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities, which may require additional investment in equipment and the hiring of additional design and application engineers aimed at developing new products. Certain of these expenditures, particularly the addition of design engineers, do not generate significant payback in the short-term. We plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by our operating activities, our existing cash balances and additional draws on our Revolving Credit Facility, as needed. Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are subject to customary conditions precedent, including the accuracy of representations and warranties and the absence of any defaults under the facility. 
 Purchases under our Stock Repurchase Program 
 We currently have in effect a stock repurchase program that was initially approved by our Board of Directors in March 2008. On March 11, 2021, the Board of Directors approved the expansion of the stock repurchase program by an additional 350.0 million. Under the program, subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may repurchase our common stock at any time or from time to time, without prior notice, subject to market conditions and other considerations. Our repurchases may be made through Rule 10b5-1 and/or Rule 10b-18 or other trading plans, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases or other transactions. 
 We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the program in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 or in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. As of October 27, 2024, the remaining authorization under the program was 209.4 million. To the extent we repurchase any shares of our common stock under the program in the future, we expect to fund such repurchases from cash on hand and borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. We have no obligation to repurchase any shares under the program and may suspend or discontinue it at any time. 
 Working Capital 
 Working capital, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities including the current portion of long-term debt, fluctuates depending on end-market demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables, inventory and payables. In times of escalating demand, our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production. In addition, our working capital may be affected by potential acquisitions and transactions involving our debt instruments. Although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances, these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Except as disclosed above, there have been no material changes to our cash requirements from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. 
 Cash Flows 
 In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended (in thousands) October 27, 2024 October 29, 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 24,491 (107,839) Net cash used in investing activities (4,085) (26,266) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (12,057) 24,337 Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (430) (1,922) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 7,919 (111,690) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by or used in operating activities is driven by net income or loss adjusted for non-cash items and fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities. 
 Operating cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 were favorably impacted by a significant decrease in annual bonus payments, lower payroll costs related to reduced headcount, a decrease in income tax payments, and lower transaction and integration costs primarily related to the Sierra Wireless 
 52 

Acquisition, and were unfavorably impacted by an 2.6 decrease in net sales, higher restructuring payments related to employee termination benefits and an incremental increase in inventory spend. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by or used in investing activities is primarily driven by capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, purchases of intangibles, and proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance. 
 Capital expenditures were 5.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, which were lower due to cost-saving initiatives, compared to 27.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 as we made investments to update and expand our production capabilities. 
 In the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, we sold investments for proceeds of 2.7 million. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, we paid 0.4 million for strategic investments, including investments in companies that are enabling the LoRa and LoRaWAN -based ecosystem, compared to 0.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. 
 Purchases of intangibles were 5.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, which included capitalized development costs and software licenses. 
 In the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 and 2024, we received 4.8 million and 2.5 million of proceeds, respectively, from corporate-owned life insurance, which were used to pay deferred compensation distributions. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by or used in financing activities is primarily attributable to proceeds or payments on our Revolving Credit Facility, payments related to deferred financing costs, payments related to employee share-based compensation payroll taxes and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 In the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, we made a payment of 5.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we borrowed 70.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 In the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, we paid 0.8 million for deferred financing costs, compared to 17.8 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. 
 In the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, we paid 7.3 million for employee share-based compensation payroll taxes and received proceeds of 1.2 million from the exercise of stock options. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we paid 5.5 million for employee share-based compensation payroll taxes. We do not directly control the timing of the exercise of stock options. Such exercises are independent decisions made by grantees and are influenced most directly by the stock price and the expiration dates of stock option awards. Such proceeds are difficult to forecast, resulting from several factors that are outside our control. We believe that such proceeds will remain a nominal source of cash in the future. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our critical accounting estimates are disclosed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. There have been no significant changes to our policies during the nine months ended October 27, 2024. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation to our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to a variety of market risks, including commodity risk and the risks related to foreign currency, interest rates and market performance that are discussed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. Many of the factors that can have an impact on our market risk are external to us, and so we are unable to fully predict them. 
 Commodity Risk 
 We are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, particularly gold, that are incorporated into our end products or used by our suppliers to process our end products. Increased commodity prices are passed on to us in the form of higher prices from our suppliers, either in the form of general price increases or a commodity surcharge. Although we generally deal with our suppliers on a purchase order basis rather than on a long-term contract basis, we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing for volumes consistent with planned production. Our gross margins may decline if we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset the increased cost. We do not enter into formal hedging arrangements to mitigate against commodity risk. 
 53 

Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our foreign operations expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against our functional currencies and we may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts (such as currency forward contracts). Gains or losses on these balances are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. As of October 27, 2024, our largest foreign currency exposures were from the Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Swiss Franc, South Korean Won, and Great British Pound. 
 We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These reasonably possible adverse changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency as of the end of our third quarter of fiscal year 2025. The adverse impact these changes would have had (after taking into account balance sheet hedges only) on our income before taxes is 4.7 million for the quarter ended October 27, 2024. 
 Interest rate and credit risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the portion of the outstanding debt under our Credit Agreement that bears interest at a variable rate as of October 27, 2024. 
 In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a 2.75 year term to hedge the variability of interest payments on 150.0 million of debt outstanding on the Term Loans at a Term SOFR rate of 3.58 , plus a variable margin and spread based on our consolidated leverage ratio. 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a 5 year term to hedge the variability of interest payments on 450.0 million of debt outstanding on the Term Loans at a Term SOFR rate of 3.44 , plus a variable margin and spread based on our consolidated leverage ratio. 
 Based upon our 232.6 million of unhedged floating-rate outstanding indebtedness as of October 27, 2024, the adverse impact a one percentage point increase in Term SOFR would have on our interest expense is 2.3 million. 
 Interest rates also affect our return on excess cash and investments. As of October 27, 2024, we had 136.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates. Interest income, net of reserves, generated by our investments and cash and cash equivalents was 0.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. A significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our cash and investments. It would also impact the market value of our investments. 
 Our investments are primarily subject to credit risk. Our investment guidelines prescribe credit quality, permissible investments, diversification, and duration restrictions. These restrictions are intended to limit risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short-term durations. Our investment strategy limits investment of new funds and maturing securities to U.S. Treasury, Federal agency securities, high quality money market funds and time deposits with our principal commercial banks. Outside of these investment guidelines, we also invest in a limited amount of debt securities in privately held companies that we view as strategic to our business. For example, many of these investments are in companies that are enabling the LoRa - and LoRaWAN -based ecosystem. 
 Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We maintain cash held in deposit at financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are insured by the FDIC in an amount up to 250,000 for any depositor. To the extent we hold cash deposits in amounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limitation, we may incur a loss in the event of a failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain deposits. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable insurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. or any applicable foreign government in the future or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a future failure or liquidity crisis. In addition, if any of our partners or parties with whom we conduct business are unable to access funds due to the status of their financial institution, such parties' ability to pay their obligations to us or to enter into new commercial arrangements requiring additional payments to us could be adversely affected. Management believes we are not exposed to significant risk due to the financial position of the depository institution, but will continue to monitor regularly and adjust, if needed, to mitigate risk. We have established guidelines regarding diversification of our investments and their maturities, which are designed to maintain principal and maximize liquidity. To date, we have not experienced any losses associated with this credit risk and continue to believe that this exposure is not significant. 
 54 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. As a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in Item 9A., Controls and Procedures, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024, and as outlined below, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of October 27, 2024. 
 Material Weaknesses 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 We have identified a deficiency in a principle associated with the risk assessment component of the COSO framework. Specifically, the control deficiency constitutes a material weakness relating to identifying and assessing changes in the business that could impact our system of internal control. Contributing factors relate to the integration of Sierra Wireless, Inc. ("Sierra Wireless"), which the Company acquired on January 12, 2023. The risk assessment material weakness contributed to other material weaknesses within our system of internal control over financial reporting at the control activity level, all of which were associated with the Sierra Wireless business. 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls to ensure that all manual journal entries were properly approved prior to being posted to the general ledger system, and certain individuals had the ability to both prepare, review and post manual journal entries to the general ledger. 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls to ensure the timely collection and maintenance of documentation necessary to support claimed value added tax ("VAT") withholding exemptions in certain jurisdictions. 
 We did not maintain adequate evidence of the review of information used to determine the inventory excess and obsolescence reserves. 
 In addition, we did not maintain adequate evidence of our review of the operating forecasts used in the preparation of the financial statements. 
 Remediation Measures 
 Management is committed to addressing and remediating the aforementioned material weaknesses and believes progress has been made in our remediation efforts. 
 We are enhancing our risk assessment process to ensure it is sufficiently robust to identify and analyze significant changes in the business, including the impact of these changes on the identification of risks and the internal control structure. 
 We have migrated the Sierra Wireless enterprise resource planning system to existing Semtech financial systems which we expect to remediate the material weakness around manual journal entries because this migration results in the use of existing policies, processes and internal controls for manual journal entry posting at Sierra Wireless going forward. 
 We are enhancing our processes and internal controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the information used to estimate the excess and obsolete inventory reserve related to Sierra Wireless inventory. 
 We have implemented enhanced processes and internal controls to ensure documentation is retained to support proof of delivery for all transactions with value added tax claims. 
 We updated our policies and educated our personnel to properly document and maintain evidence of review of operating forecasts and information used in preparation of the financial statements. 
 As we continue to evaluate and work to remediate the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weaknesses, we may determine that additional measures are required to address the control deficiencies, or that we need to modify or otherwise adjust the remediation measures described above. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our remediation efforts in 
 connection with our evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting. Further, while certain remediation measures are currently in place, the identified material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the remediation measures have been fully designed and implemented, the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we have concluded through testing that the newly implemented controls are operating effectively. 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 Other than the remediation measures described above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended October 27, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
