EXPLANATORY NOTE 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly
Report for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024 contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are neither
historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions
regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy, and other
future conditions. This includes, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position and the plans and objectives of management
for our future operations. Such statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
When used in this Quarterly Report, words such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, 
 estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, 
 potential, predict, project, should, strive, would 
and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not
forward-looking. Factors that could materially affect our business operations and financial performance and condition include, but are
not limited to, those risks and uncertainties described herein under Item 1A. Risk Factors, those described in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under Item 1A. Risk Factors, filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC ). You are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements
and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are based on information
available to us as of the filing date of this Quarterly Report. Unless required by law, we do not intend to publicly update or revise
any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or future events or otherwise. You should, however, review the risk factors
we describe in the reports we will file from time to time with the SEC after the date of this Quarterly Report. 

This Quarterly Report may also contain market data
related to our business and industry. These market data include projections that are based on a number of assumptions. If these assumptions
turn out to be incorrect, actual results may differ from the projections based on these assumptions. As a result, our markets may not
grow at the rates projected by these data, or at all. The failure of these markets to grow at these projected rates may harm our business,
results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.

 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The
accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and, in the opinion of the Company, contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of its financial position as of March 31, 2024, and its results of operations for the
three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023. The condensed consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2023, was derived from the audited annual financial statements but does not contain all of the
footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements. 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries
Conduit UK Management Ltd. (United Kingdom) and Conduit Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Cayman Islands). As used herein, references to the Company 
include references to Conduit Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

In
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205-40, Going Concern, the Company has evaluated whether there
are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Since its inception, the Company has generated significant
losses and as of March 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and
2023, the Company had net losses of million and million, respectively, and cash used in operating activities of million
and million, respectively. 

The
Company completed the Merger that also included a private placement of an aggregate amount of 
million of the Company s shares of common stock (referred to as the PIPE ). The proceeds received from the Merger
and PIPE, net of transaction costs, totaled 
million. On March 4, 2024, the Company received a Commitment Letter in the amount of 
million, subject to agreement and definition documentation, from Corvus Capital, a major shareholder and related party. The facility
allows for single draws of up to ,
and limits draw requests to 
in any 30-day period. An interest rate of 
annually will apply from the date of the advance request, and repayment is to begin in 12 equal monthly installments, commencing on
April 30, 2025. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had not received any proceeds from the additional 
million commitment. Despite the closing of the Merger and an additional 
million commitment from a major stockholder, the Company has determined that it does not have sufficient cash and other sources of
liquidity to fund its current business plans. Management believes these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least the next 12 months from the financial statement filing
date. 

The
Company s expectation is to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future and will need additional
funding to support its current business plan. Management s plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include
the pursuit of additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings. There is no assurance that such funding will be available when needed or on acceptable terms. If additional funding
is not available when required, the Company would need to delay or curtail its operations and its research and development activities
until such funding is received, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition. 

These
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include adjustments to reflect
the possible effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Other
Risks and Uncertainties 

The
Company is subject to risks common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, uncertainties related to
commercialization of competitor products, regulatory approvals, dependence on key products, dependence on key customers and suppliers,
and protection of intellectual property rights. Clinical assets currently under development will require significant additional research
and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These
efforts will require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel, infrastructure, and extensive compliance and reporting
capabilities. Even if the Company s efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize significant
revenue from royalties or product sales. 

The
Company relies on agreements with related parties and third parties for the purpose of developing and licensing clinical assets from
St George Street and, in turn, St George Street licenses such assets from AstraZeneca. See Note 12. If there is a breach or other termination
of such agreements, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, operating results,
and prospects. In addition, the Company is not a party to the license agreements between St George Street and AstraZeneca. The termination
of such third-party agreements could have a material impact on or materially disrupt operations. While the Company holds its own intellectual
property outside of the scope of these agreements, termination of such agreements could adversely affect the business and ability to
commercialize our clinical assets. 

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies 

(or approximately does not exceed the country s deposit limit of 
 (approximately ).
The Company s U.S. depository bank participates in the Demand Deposit Marketplace program, insuring deposits up to 
 million by sweeping amounts in excess of the
 deposit
insurance limit among participating banks. The Company has not experienced any losses on any accounts through the three months ended
March 31, 2024. 

Unobservable
inputs reflect the Company s assumption about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed
based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels, based on the
inputs, as follows: 

Level
 1-Valuations based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that
 are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these instruments does not entail a significant degree of judgment. 

Level
 2- Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for either similar instruments
 in active markets, identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant
 value drivers are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level
 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable. These valuations require significant judgment. 

The
Company s Level 1 assets consist of cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying balance sheets, convertible notes payable and the value of accrued expenses
and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. 

As
of March 31, 2024, the Company has one financial liability, a warrant liability for which the fair value is determined based on Level
2 inputs as such inputs are valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for
either similar instrument in active markets. See Note 4 for further information on the Company s financial liabilities carried
at fair value. 

If
financial instruments, such as the warrants, are not required to be classified as liabilities under ASC 480, the Company assesses whether
such instruments are indexed to the Company s own stock under ASC 815-40. In order for an instrument to be considered indexed to
an entity s own stock, its settlement amount must always equal the difference between the following: (a) the fair value of a fixed
number of the Company s equity shares, and (b) a fixed monetary amount or a fixed amount of a debt instrument issued by the Company. 

Equity classified warrants are recorded in stockholders deficit and liability classified warrants are recorded as liabilities
within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The liability classified warrants are remeasured each period with changes recorded in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

Revision
of Previously Issued Financials Statements: March 31, 2023 

In
connection with the preparation of the Company s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the
Company s management identified errors in its previously issued unaudited financial statements as of and for the three months
ended March 31, 2023 with respect to how certain expenses relating to the Merger were previously expensed and that as part of the
Company s annual audit it was determined that such expenses should have been capitalized and subsequently recorded against
equity and restated such quarterly period in the December 31, 2023 Form 10-K. The accounting for legal costs was deemed to be
specific incremental costs directly attributable to the Merger and concurrent PIPE financing (See Note 3). Management has evaluated
this correction to the accounting treatment of such costs, which overstated net loss, additional paid in capital, and accumulated deficit and understated prepaid
expense, and concluded it was material to the prior quarterly periods, individually and in the aggregate.

was not converted at the closing of the Merger and was also not converted as of March 31, 2024. The Company has not elected the fair
value option and will account for the promissory convertible note payable as a liability in accordance with ASC 480 on the Company s
balance sheet. The only subsequent measurement impact on a recurring basis until conversion (if conversion occurs) or prepayment (if
prepayment occurs) will be to record the accrued interest as a liability and reduce the balances of the Note and its accrued interest
for cash payments made against these balances. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, interest on the convertible
promissory note totaled forty thousand dollars and forty thousand dollars, respectively.

shares of Common Stock. Pursuant to the Plan Evergreen Provision, the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under
the 2023 Plan was increased by shares of common stock effective January 1, 2024. The number of authorized shares will
automatically increase on January 1, 2025 and continuing annually on each anniversary thereof through (and including) January 1,
2033, equal to the lesser of (i) 
of the Shares outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (ii) such smaller number of Shares as
determined by the Board or the Committee. The 2023 Plan allows for awards to be issued to employees and non-employee directors in
the form of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, dividend
equivalents, other stock-based, or other cash-based awards. As of March 31, 2024, there were

Stock 

In
connection with the Merger, as discussed in Notes 1 and 3, and by Unanimous Written Consent of the Board of Directors, the Chief Financial
Officer of Conduit Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was granted restricted stock units RSUs on December 1, 2023 at a weighted
average grant date fair value of . The RSUs vest in equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of the closing of
the Merger. No additional RSU s were granted during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. RSUs were vested as of March 31, 2024
and December 31, 2023. 

As
of March 31, 2024 there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock awards, which
is expected to be recognized over a weighted average vesting period of years. 

Stock
Options 

The
Company estimates the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company
then recognizes the grant date fair value of each option as compensation expense ratably using the straight-line attribution method over
the service period (generally the vesting period). The Black-Scholes model incorporates the following assumptions: 

Expected
 volatility the Company estimates the volatility of the share price of their peer companies at the date of grant using a look-back 
 period which coincides with the expected term, defined below. The Company believes using a look-back period which coincides
 with the expected term is the most appropriate measure for determining expected volatility. 

Expected
 term the Company estimates the expected term using the simplified method outlined in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
 No. 107, Share-Based Payment. 

Risk-free
 interest rate the Company estimates the risk- free interest rate using the U.S. Treasury Yield curve for periods equal to
 the expected term of the options in effect at the time of grant. 

Dividends
 the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero because the Company has not declared nor paid a cash dividend, nor are
 there any plans to declare a dividend. 

The
Company did not grant stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2024 or March 31, 2023. 

The
Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur, which may result in the reversal of compensation costs in subsequent periods as the forfeitures
arise.

The
aggregate intrinsic value of options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the fair
value of the Company s common stock for those options that had exercise prices lower than the fair value of the Company s
common stock. As of March 31, 2024, the total compensation cost related to non-vested option awards not yet recognized was million

a discount as specified under the terms of the 2021 Convertible Note Loan Instrument and the 2022 Convertible Note Loan Instrument. 

St
George Street Capital 

St
George Street Capital is a significant investor in the Company through subscribing to common shares of Old Conduit, which were exchanged
for shares of Common Stock upon the closing of the Merger. Further, the Company has an Exclusive Funding Agreement (as defined below) with St George Street Capital.
For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did t incur expenses to St George Street Capital. As of March 31, 2024
and December 31, 2023, the Company did not owe any amounts to St George Street Capital. 

On
March 26, 2021, the Company entered into the Exclusive Funding Agreement Funding Agreement with St George Street Capital.
Under the agreement, the Company has the first exclusive right, but not the obligation, to provide or procure funding for the performance
of a drug discovery and/or development project that St George Street wishes to undertake (each a Project in consideration for a share of the Net Revenue, as defined in respect to each Project (each a Project Option ). St George
Street must notify the Company in writing of each Project St George Street wishes to undertake (each a Project Notice ).
Within 90 days of a Project Notice, the Company must notify St George Street in writing whether it wishes to exercise its exclusive right
to provide all or some of the funding. Such notice exercising the Project Option will specify the source and amount of the required funding
the Company will provide. In the event the Company exercises its Project Option, the parties shall come to agreement for the provision
of funding for the Project (each a Project Funding Agreement ). Within 30 days of the entry into any Project Funding Agreement,
a joint commercialization committee will be established to oversee the Project. Upon the receipt of any Net Revenue, as defined, St George
Street will first pay the expenses it has incurred, and the remaining Net Revenue will be shared between the parties according to the
agreed percentage. 

We
and St George Street have entered into five project funding agreements, which are subject to the terms of the Global Funding Agreement,
to develop certain clinical assets that have been licensed to St George Street by AstraZeneca. The project funding agreements relate
to: 

AZD1656 for use in renal transplant, 

AZD1656 for use in pre-term labor, 

AZD1656 for use in Hashimoto s thyroiditis, 

AZD1656 for use in uveitis, and 

AZD5904 for use in idiopathic male infertility. 

At
present, the Company has not determined whether to fund any of these projects, although its ability to choose to remains at the present
time. Subject to the terms of the Global Funding Agreement, and project funding agreements, either we or St George Street may seek funding
for projects from third parties. 

Pursuant
to its terms, the Global Funding Agreement remains effective in respect of each project until the expiration of the right of a party
to receive a share of the Net Revenue (as defined in the Global Funding Agreement) pursuant to the Global Funding Agreement. Under certain
circumstances, St George Street may terminate a project (i) in the event of a material or persistent breach of the Global Funding Agreement
by us, subject to a cure period if the breach is capable of remedy, or (ii) in the event St George Street decides to cease development
of a project. If an event of force majeure occurs and continues for a designated period of time, the innocent party may terminate the
Global Funding Agreement after a notice period. 

Either
party may terminate a project if a voluntary arrangement is proposed or approved or an administration order is made, or a receiver or
administrative receiver is appointed of any of the other party s assets or undertakings or a winding-up resolution or petition
is passed (otherwise than for the purpose of solvent reconstruction or amalgamation, in particular with respect to any reorganization
of the structure of that party) or if any circumstances arise which entitle a court or a creditor to appoint a receiver, administrative
receiver or administrator or make a winding-up order or similar or equivalent action is taken against or by that other party by reason
of its insolvency or in consequence of debt. Generally, each project funding agreement may be terminated by us if at any time St George
Street ceases the conduct of development or commercialization of the relevant products in accordance with the relevant development plan
for a designated period of time, provided that the termination is only effective with respect to the specified project and the Global
Funding Agreement continues in effect for all other projects. They may also be terminated by either party upon written notice to other
party if the other party materially breaches the project funding agreement and does not fully cure the breach to the non-breaching party s
satisfaction within 90 days. 

As

third party to purchase up to an aggregate shares of the Company s common stock, in exchange for entering into a lock-up
with respect to the shares of common stock held by such holder (the Lock-Up Agreement ). The Company recognized at

Equity
Classified Warrants 

Pursuant
to MURF s initial public offering, the Company sold units at a price of per unit. Each unit consisted of one
share of MURF Class A common stock and one redeemable Publicly Traded Warrant. Each whole Publicly Traded Warrant entitled the holder
to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustment. The warrants are publicly traded
on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol CDTTW. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of its initial public offering, MURF consummated the private sale to the Sponsor of private placement units
at a price of per private placement unit. Each private placement unit was comprised of one share of MURF Class A common stock
and one Private Placement Warrant. Each Private Placement Warrant was exercisable to purchase one share of MURF Class A common stock
at a price of per share, subject to adjustment. The private placement units (including the Class A common stock issuable upon
exercise of the warrants included in the private placement units) were not transferable, assignable, or saleable until 30 days after
the completion of a Merger, subject to certain exceptions. 

In
connection with the closing of the Merger on September 22, 2023, the Equity Classified Warrants were amended to entitle each holder to
purchase one share of the Company s Common Stock. 

The
Equity Classified Warrants became exercisable 30 days after the Closing Date of the Merger. The Equity Classified Warrants will expire
five years after the Closing Date of the Merger or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The
Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of a Equity Classified Warrant and will
have no obligation to settle such exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Common
Stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations
described below with respect to registration. No Equity Classified Warrant will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue
shares of Common Stock upon exercise unless the Common Stock issuable upon such exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to
be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the Equity Classified Warrant. In the event
that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to an Equity Classified Warrant, the holder
of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will
we be required to net cash settle any Equity Classified Warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the
exercised Equity Classified Warrant, the purchaser of a unit containing such Equity Classified Warrant will have paid the full purchase
price for the unit solely for the share of Common Stock underlying such unit. 

Conduit
may call the Publicly Traded Warrants in whole and not in part, at a price of per warrant, 

upon
 not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each Publicly Traded Warrant holder; and 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock
 splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period
 commencing once the Publicly Traded Warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before we send the notice of
 redemption to the warrant holders. 

If
and when the Publicly Traded Warrants become redeemable by Conduit, Conduit may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of
shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Publicly Traded Warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable
state blue sky laws or Conduit are unable to effect such registration or qualification. Conduit will use its best efforts to register
or qualify such shares of Common Stock under the blue sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the Publicly Traded
Warrants were offered by Conduit in the offering. 

If
Conduit calls the Publicly Traded Warrants for redemption as described above, Conduit s management will have the option to require
any holder that wishes to exercise its Publicly Traded Warrant to do so on a cashless basis. In determining whether to
require all holders to exercise their Publicly Traded Warrants on a cashless basis, Conduit s management will consider,
among other factors, Conduit s cash position, the number of Publicly Traded Warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect
on Conduit stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of our Publicly Traded Warrants.
If Conduit s management takes advantage of this option, all holders of Publicly Traded Warrants would pay the exercise price by
surrendering their Publicly Traded Warrants for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x)
the product of the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Publicly Traded Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the
exercise price of the Publicly Traded Warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value.
The fair market value for this purpose shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Common Stock for the 10 trading
days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of Publicly Traded Warrants.
If Conduit s management takes advantage of this option, the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate
the number of shares of Common Stock to be received upon exercise of the Publicly Traded Warrants, including the fair market value 
in such case. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive
effect of a Publicly Traded Warrant redemption. 

The
Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Publicly Traded Warrants, except that such warrants will be exercisable for cash or on
a cashless basis, at the holder s option, and will not be redeemable by Conduit, in each case so long as they are still held by
the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. 

As
summarized above, the Company has the option to redeem all of the Publicly Traded Warrants at a cash price of per warrant during
the exercisability period if the Company s common stock has closed at a trading price above for 20 days during a 30 day
trading window. Management notes that this option is within the Company s control, therefore it does not represent an obligation 
and does not create a liability under ASC 480. Management considered the guidance within ASC 815-40-15-7A, noting that an exercise contingency
would not preclude permanent equity classification if all of the other equity criteria are met. As all other criteria to be classified
as permanent equity are met, the Publicly Traded Warrants are classified as permanent equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Management
assessed the Private Placement Warrants and determined that the warrants are considered to be indexed to the entity s own stock
and met all the criteria for permanent equity classification. As such, the Private Placement Warrants are also classified as permanent
equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The
Warrants issued in March 2024 are not exercisable until one year after their date of issuance. Each Warrant is exercisable into one
share of the Company s common stock at a price per share of 
(as adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof) for a two-year period after the date of exercisability. . 

The
issuance of the Warrants was made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder. 

Liability
Classified Warrants 

As
discussed in Note 3, warrants were issued to the PIPE Investors as of the closing of the Merger pursuant to subscription agreements.
The warrants provide the PIPE Investors the right to purchase up to shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of .
Additionally, on the Closing Date of the Merger, the Company issued warrants to A.G.P. (the A.G.P. Warrants for services provided directly related
to the Merger. The warrants provide AGP the right to purchase up to shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 
per share. 

The
warrants issued to the PIPE Investors and the advisor (collectively the Liability Classified Warrants contain materially
the same terms and are exercisable for a period of five years, beginning on October 22, 2023. 

The
PIPE Warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder s option. The PIPE Warrants are not redeemable by
the Company. 

The
A.G.P. Warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder s option. The Company may call the A.G.P. Warrants
for redemption, in whole and not in part, at any time after the A.G.P. Warrants become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at
a price of per A.G.P. Warrant, 

upon
 not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds per
 share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and other similar
 events) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period commencing once the A.G.P.
 Warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption
 to the warrant holders; and 

provided
 there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of Common
 Stock underlying the A.G.P. Warrants for each day in the 30 trading day period and continuing
 each thereafter until the redemption date. 

If
the Company calls the A.G.P. Warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require any holder that
wishes to exercise its A.G.P. Warrant to do so on a cashless basis. If our management takes advantage of this option, holders
of A.G.P. Warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their A.G.P. Warrants for that number of shares of Common Stock as calculated
pursuant to the A.G.P. Warrant. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby
lessen the dilutive effect of an A.G.P. Warrant redemption. 

The
Liability Classified Warrants are classified as derivative liabilities because they do not meet the criteria in ASC 815-40 to be considered
indexed to the entity s own stock as the warrants could be settled for an amount that is not equal to the difference between the
fair value of a fixed number of the entity s shares and a fixed monetary amount. The Liability Classified Warrants are initially
measured at fair value based on the price of the Publicly Traded Warrants and are remeasured at fair value at subsequent financial reporting
period end dates and upon exercise (see Note 6 for additional information regarding fair value). 

As
March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the consolidated balance sheets contained derivative warrant liabilities of 
 million and 
 million, respectively. 

million and, as a result of the completion
of the Business Combination, to be issued million shares of common stock. The potential contingency is not considered probable or
reasonable estimable as of the financial statement issuance date and no loss contingency accruals have been incurred in the accompanying
financial statements. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. Regardless of its outcome, the litigation may impact our business
due to, among other things, defense legal cost and the diversion of the attention of our management. 

Leases 

On
March 7, 2024, the Company entered into a lease agreement with respect to approximately square
feet of space in Cambridge, England, for a lease term commencing in March 2024 and ending in January 2027. The Company recorded a
right-of-use asset of million

June 3, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with SGSC for an indirect investment in AZD 1656. Under the terms of the agreement,
SGSC agreed to pay the Company a royalty of of sales in excess of million million) of AZD 1656 should it reach
the commercialization stage and generate revenue in exchange for the Company funding SGSC s research and development efforts. As

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the related notes included under Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report as well as the Company s audited financial statements and notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023 that was filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set
forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The following
discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including
those set forth under the section titled Risk Factors or in other parts of this Quarterly Report . Our historical
results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. Conduit Pharmaceuticals Limited
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Murphy Canyon Acquisition Corp. MURF on November 8, 2022. The transaction contemplated by the terms of the Merger Agreement was completed on September 22, 2023, in conjunction
with which MURF changed its name to Conduit Pharmaceuticals Inc. (hereafter referred to, collectively with is subsidiaries as Conduit ,
the Company , we , us or our , unless the context otherwise requires). All dollar
amounts are expressed in thousands of United States dollars ), unless otherwise indicated. 

Overview 

Conduit
has developed a unique business model that allows it to act as a conduit to bring clinical assets from pharmaceutical companies
and develop new treatments for patients. Our novel approach addresses unmet medical need and lengthens the intellectual property for
our existing assets through cutting-edge solid-form technology and then commercialize these products with life science companies. 

We
are led by highly experienced pharma executives, Dr. Freda Lewis-Hall, former Chief Medical Officer of Pfizer Inc., the Chair of our
Board of Directors, and Dr. David Tapolczay, former Chief Executive Officer of the United Kingdom-based medical research charity LifeArc,
our Chief Executive Officer. 

While
simultaneously leveraging the capabilities of our Cambridge laboratory facility and highly experienced team of solid-form experts to
extend or develop proprietary solid-form intellectual property for our existing and future clinical assets. Our own intellectual property
portfolio comprises a 20-year patent pending solid-form compound, the AZD1656 Cocrystal (a HK-4 Glucokinase Activator), targeting a wide
range of autoimmune diseases. Our pipeline research includes a number of compounds that serve as promising alternatives to existing clinical
assets currently marketed and sold by large pharmaceutical companies, which we have identified as having an opportunity to develop further
intellectual property positions through solid-form technology. 

In
connection with the funding and development of clinical assets, we evaluate and select the specific molecules to be developed and collaborate
with external CROs and KOLs to run clinical trials that are managed, funded, and overseen by us. We intend to leverage our comprehensive
clinical and scientific expertise in order to facilitate development of clinical assets through Phase II trials in an efficient manner
by using CROs and third-party service providers. We will also collaborate closely with disease specific KOLs to collectively assess and
determine the most appropriate indications for all our current and forthcoming assets. 

We
believe that successful Phase II trials of the clinical assets in our pipeline will increase the value of our assets. There is no assurance
that any clinical trials on the assets owned or licensed by us will be successful, however, following a successful Phase II clinical
trial, we would look to licensing opportunities with large biotech or pharmaceutical companies, typically for up-front milestone payments
and royalty income streams for the life of the asset patent. We anticipate using any future royalty income stream to develop our asset
portfolio in combination with other potential sources of financing, including debt or equity financing. 

Outside
of our proprietary owned patented clinical assets, we have an exclusive relationship and partnership with St George Street, a biomedical
charity based in the United Kingdom. We have the option to fund 100 of the development of clinical assets that were initially licensed
to St George Street by AstraZeneca. There may be additional opportunities for us to partner with St George Street to fund the
development of additional clinical assets in the future, licensed from Astra Zeneca. 

26 

AstraZeneca
has conducted initial pre-clinical and, in some instances, clinical trials on these assets, but has decided to license them for further
development. 

In
addition to our patent pending solid-form compound targeting a wide range of autoimmune diseases, two assets which were licensed from
AstraZeneca to St George Street that is expected to be developed by us include AZD5904 (a Myeloperoxidase Inhibitor) targeting idiopathic
male infertility and AZD1656 (a Glucokinase Activator) targeting autoimmune diseases or immunodeficient conditions including uveitis,
premature labor, renal transplant rejection, and Hashimoto s thyroiditis. 

As
the clinical assets have undergone initial pre-clinical and clinical testing conducted by AstraZeneca, we are able to use the safety
data generated in these clinical trials to assess which clinical assets to further develop and for which indications. 

Through
this relationship, there are considerable APIs that were manufactured by AstraZeneca in conducting its clinical trials available. As
a result, Conduit may not have to develop the APIs, which is often a time consuming and expensive process, and the APIs already produced
were subject to rigorous quality control measures. 

Furthermore,
Conduit is well positioned, and intends, to pursue additional relationships and/or partnerships with third parties for the licensing
of further assets which are currently deprioritized. We plan to focus our efforts on developing clinical assets to address diseases that
impact a large population where there is no present treatment or the present treatment, carries significant unwanted side effects. 

Key
Component of Result of Operations 

Operating
Expenses 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the research and development of our candidates and programs.
We expense research and development costs and intangible assets acquired that have no alternative future use as incurred. These expenses
include: 

personnel-related
 expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in research and development functions; 

expenses
 incurred in connection with the clinical development and regulatory approval of our clinical assets, including under agreements with
 third parties, such as consultants, contractors and CROs; 

license
 fees with no alternative use; and 

other
 expenses related to research and development. 

We
expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future
for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the benefits are
consumed. 

We
incurred approximately 128,000 on research and development activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024. There was no comparable research and development funding during
the three months ended March 31, 2023. Our research and development activities have been wholly focused on developing co-crystals of AZD1656
to increase patent life. Some of this work was completed by third-party CROs but all intellectual property is retained by us. We currently
have one pending international patent application and two pending national patent applications. The successful completion of clinical
trials increases the value of clinical assets and may lead to the commercialization and/or licensing of such assets to other pharmaceutical
companies. There is no assurance that any clinical trials on the assets owned or licensed by us will be successful. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist of salaries and other related costs, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters,
professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, insurance costs, travel, and other operating costs. 

27 

We
anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we increase our administrative
headcount to operate as a public company and as we advance clinical assets through clinical development. We also will incur additional
expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the
SEC and the Nasdaq listing rules, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional
services. In addition, if regulatory approval is obtained for clinical assets, we expect to incur expenses associated with building a
sales and marketing team. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

Other
income (expenses), net 

Other
income (expense), net consists of change in the fair value of options, change in fair value of convertible notes, and expense
incurred upon the issuance of warrants during the quarter. Other income (expense), net consists of change in the fair value of
options, change in fair value of convertible notes, and expense incurred upon the issuance of warrants during the
quarter. 

Interest
expense, net 

Interest
expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on convertible loan notes and promissory notes and interest expense on deferred commissions
payable to an advisor for fees related to the Merger, as well as a small amount of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held
by the Company.

Research
and development expenses increased by 0.1 million, or 100 , for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to nil for the three
months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the development of certain co-crystals of AZD1656 (AZD1656 Co-Crystal PCT/IB2022/00075 - Patent Expires 02/09/2042) during the quarter
ended March 31, 2024. We will seek to develop the AZD1656 Co-Crystal in psoriasis, Crohn s disease, lupus, sarcoidosis, diabetic
wound healing, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). There was no comparative activity during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Management
assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. Since our inception,
and in line with our growth strategy, we have prepared our financial statements assuming we will continue as a going concern. Since our
inception, we have incurred net losses and experienced negative cash flows from operations. To date, our primary sources of capital have
been through private placements of equity securities and convertible debt as well as PIPE financing as a result of the Merger. During
the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we had net losses of 3.6 million and 1.7 million, respectively. We
expect to incur additional losses and higher operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development
programs. We have determined that additional financing will be required to fund our operations for the next 12 months and our ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional capital and financing. 

Sources
and Uses of Liquidity 

Our
primary uses of cash are to fund our operations as we continue to grow our business. We will require a significant amount of cash for
expenditures as we invest in ongoing research and development and business operations. Until such time as we can generate significant
revenue from commercialization of our product, we expect to finance our cash needs for ongoing research and development and business
operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other capital sources, including strategic partnerships. However, we
may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements, when needed, on favorable terms or at all. To the extent
that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders
will be, or could be, diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the
rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting
or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, or substantially
reduce research and development efforts. While the Company believes in the viability of its ability to raise additional funds, there
can be no assurances to that effect. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
for a period of twelve months from the date the financial statements are issued. These financial statements have been prepared assuming
the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include adjustments to reflect the possible effects on the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

29 

Cash
Requirements 

Our
material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. 

Promissory
Convertible Note 

In
March 2023, we issued an aggregate principal amount of 0.8 million convertible promissory note payable to an investor. 

The
promissory convertible note matures and is payable in full, 18 months from the date of the note. The note carries 20 interest and is
payable every six months from the date of the note until the maturity date. The note is subject to conversion of Conduit s common stock following
the consummation of the Merger taking place prior to the maturity date of the promissory convertible note. 

Loans
Payable 

In
May 2022, we entered into two loan agreements, with an aggregate principal amount of 0.2 million, with two lenders. 

The
loans payable mature and is payable in full two years from the date of the agreement and bear no interest. 

For
additional information regarding our convertible promissory note, see Note 7 of the note to the unaudited financial statements. 

Working
Capital 

We
currently anticipate that cash required for working capital for the next 12 months is approximately 14.4 million, which includes
deferred financing fees payable of 5.7 million, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 0.9 million, a convertible
promissory note, if not converted prior to maturity, of 0.8 million, income taxes payable of 0.1 million and a note payable of
 0.2 million that matures within the next 12 months. We do not anticipate being able to fund required capital expenditures for the
next 12 months with cash and cash equivalents on hand as we have a history of limited cash on hand. We have historically been able
to access funds through the issuance of our convertible notes and believe we can continue to obtain funding through debt and equity financing agreements as needed to meet cash requirements for the next 12 months.

Cash
Flows Used in Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was 2.4 million, resulting primarily from a net loss of
 3.6 million, adjusted for non-cash items including a 0.4 million of stock-based compensation, a 0.4 million of amortization expense,
a 0.5 million expense on the issuance of warrants and a 0.1 million interest expense of the deferred commission payable. The 0.2 million
cash outflow from operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to a 0.1 cash inflow from accrued expense and other current liabilities
due to differences in the timing of disbursements and a 0.2 million cash outflow from prepaid expenses. 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was 1.9 million, resulting primarily from a net loss of
 1.7 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 0.3 million for a loss on the change in fair value of convertible notes payable, a 0.2
million loss change in reserve on a related party loan, and a 0.1 million loss on the change in fair value of the Cizzle option. The
 0.7 million cash outflow from operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to a 0.2 cash outflow from accrued expense and other
current liabilities due to differences in the timing of disbursements and a 0.4 million cash outflow from prepaid expenses due to capitalized
costs incurred in connection with the Company s Merger. 

Cash
Flows (Used) Provided by Investing Activities 

There was no
cash flow from investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was 0.3 million, resulting from the issuance
of a loan to a related party. 

Cash
Flows Provided by Financing Activities 

There
was no cash flow from financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was 2.2 million, resulting from the issuance of a convertible
note payable of 1.4 million, and 0.7 million from the issuance of a convertible promissory note payable. 

Contractual
Obligations and Other Commitments 

As
of March 31, 2024, we had no non-cancellable commitments for the purchase of clinical materials, contract manufacturing, maintenance
and committed funding which we expect to pay within one year. 

31 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing
basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant
estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported
financial results include the following: 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity
of operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern. In connection
with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023,
we conducted an evaluation as to whether there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, which raised substantial doubt
as to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the issuance of such financial statements, and concluded
that substantial doubt existed as to our ability to continue as a going concern as further discussed in Note 1 in the notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report. 

Under
ASC 205-40, the receipt of potential funding from future partnerships, equity or debt issuances, potential achievement of milestones
from customer agreements and reductions in workforce cannot be considered probable at this time because these plans are not entirely
within our control and/or have not been approved by our board of directors as of the date of issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Our
expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future and the need for additional funding to support
our planned operations, raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plans to alleviate the conditions
that raise substantial doubt include reduced spending, and the pursuit of additional capital. We have concluded the likelihood that our
plan to successfully obtain sufficient funding from one or more of these sources, or adequately reduce expenditures, while possible,
is less than probable. We believe that the accounting estimates described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity.
Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results
of operations. 

Fair
Value Measurements 

Accounting
Standards Codification ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is to be determined based on
the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. In determining fair value, the Company used
various valuation approaches. A fair value hierarchy has been established for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the
use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the Company. 

Unobservable
inputs reflect the Company s assumption about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed
based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels, based on the
inputs, as follows: 

Level
 1-Valuations based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that
 are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these instruments does not entail a significant degree of judgment. 

32 

Level
 2- Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for either similar instruments
 in active markets, identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant
 value drivers are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level
 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable. These valuations require significant judgment. 

The
Company s Level 1 assets consist of cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying balance sheets and the value of accrued expenses
and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. 

As
of March 31, 2024, the Company has one financial liability, a warrant liability for which the fair value is determined based on Level
2 inputs as such inputs are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices. 

The warrant liability is valued using a Black-Scholes model, with the most judgmental non-observable input being
the volatility measure. Changes in the assumptions around the volatility can cause significant changes in the estimated fair value of
the warrant liability. See Note 4 for further information on the Company s financial liabilities carried at fair value. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

The
Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). Under
the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of
the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period
for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the
earlier of the date that: (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended
transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with
the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

Upon
closing of the Merger, the surviving company remained an emerging growth company, as defined by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups act
of 2012, until the earliest of (i) the last day of the combined entity s first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the
completion of MURF s initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which the combined entity has total annual
gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which the combined entity is deemed to be a large
accelerated filer, which means the market value of the combined entity s common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0
million as of the prior December 31st or (iv) the date on which the combined entity has issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible
debt securities during the prior three year period. 

33 

In
addition, Conduit is a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. The Company may continue to be a smaller reporting company
even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller
reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as (i) Conduit s voting and non-voting
common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter or (ii)
Conduit s annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and its voting and non-voting
common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business day of its second fiscal quarter. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure regarding quantitative and qualitative
market risk. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024 and for the comparison
fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation,
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report, our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to material weaknesses previously identified and not yet remediated as of the end of both such periods. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes to in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter. 

34 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

Other
than as set forth below, we are not currently party to or aware of being subject to any material legal proceedings. However, we may from
time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Regardless of outcome, litigation could impact our business
due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

In
August 2023, prior to the Merger, our now wholly-owned subsidiary, Conduit Pharmaceuticals Limited, received a letter from Strand claiming it was owed advisory fees pursuant to a previously executed letter. Conduit rejected and disputes
the substance of the letter in full. Following such rejection, on September 7, 2023, Strand filed a claim in the Business and Property
Courts of England and Wales claiming it is entitled to be paid the sum of 2 million and, as a result of the completion of the Merger,
to be issued 6.5 million shares of common stock. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. Regardless of its outcome, the
litigation may impact our business due to, among other things, defense legal costs and the diversion of the attention of our management. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

There
are no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023, filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. 

Item
