Our retransmission agreements and network affiliation agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Other intangibles primarily include distribution agreements from our multicast networks acquisition, which are also amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. In the first nine months of 2024 , gross intangible assets and associated accumulated amortization decreased by million, due to certain intangible assets reaching the end of their useful lives. On January 31, 2024, Premion, LLC acquired substantially all the assets of Octillion Media, a next-generation, demand-side platform focused on Local Connected TV (CTV)/Over-the-Top (OTT) advertising. The acquisition expands Premion s capabilities in the growing CTV marketplace by combining Octillion s technology with Premion s local CTV/OTT advertising solution. The base purchase price of the acquisition was million plus an adjustment for working capital and a maximum earnout of million that the sellers will be entitled to receive if the Octillion Media business achieves certain technological and financial milestones during a defined period following the closing. In the third quarter of 2024, the Octillion Media business achieved the performance milestones contemplated by the first earnout, and as a result we paid million of additional consideration to the sellers during the quarter. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , million of the purchase price had been paid. The acquisition was funded with available cash on hand. We are accounting for the acquisition as a business combination, which requires us to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. The amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We have commenced the appraisals necessary to assess the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the amount of goodwill to be recognized. Based on preliminary valuations we have recorded million of intangible assets related to acquired technology and customer relationships. We also recorded an additional million as goodwill, which represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from the acquisition that do not qualify for separate recognition, including assembled workforce, as well as future synergies that we expect to generate. The goodwill and intangible assets are deductible for tax purposes. The amounts recorded for acquired assets and liabilities are preliminary in nature and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.

The pre-tax gain of million associated with this sale is included in Other non-operating items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Following this sale we no longer have any ownership interest in BMI. Deferred financing costs : These costs consist of amounts paid to lenders related to our revolving credit facility. On January 25, 2024, we entered into an amendment of our credit facility that resulted in the capitalization of million of fees paid to lenders under the new amendment. Additionally, we reclassified approximately million of fees under the previous credit facility as non-current deferred financing costs. See Note 4 for additional details of the revolving credit facility amendment. Financing costs paid for our unsecured notes are accounted for as a reduction in the debt obligation. Prepaid assets: These amounts primarily consist of an asset related to a long-term services agreement for IT security.

On January 25, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement). Among other things, the amendment amends the Credit Agreement to: Reduce the Commitments (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from billion to million; 

 Extend the term of such Commitments from August 15, 2024 to January 25, 2029, subject to a -day springing maturity date if debt in excess of million (subject to certain exceptions) were to mature before such date; 

 Add the right to obtain a temporary x step-up in the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) after consummating a Qualified Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement); 

 Increase the amount of Unrestricted Cash (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to million; 

 Amend the definition of Consolidated EBITDA to include an add-back for certain professional fees and expenses; and 

 Establish a million swingline facility. 

 Under the amended Credit Agreement, the Company s maximum Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) will remain unchanged at x. As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled million and we had million of letters of credit outstanding and unused borrowing capacity of million under our million rev olving credit facility, which expires in January 2029 . We were in compliance with all covenants, including the leverage ratio (our financial covenant) contained in our debt agreements and revolving credit facility. We believe, based on our current financial forecasts and trends, that we will remain compliant with all covenants for the foreseeable future.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we made cash contributions to the TRP of million and million, respectively. We made benefit payments to participants of the SERP of million during each of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . We expect to make additional cash payments of million to our SERP participants during the remainder of 2024 .

In the third quarter of 2024, the Octillion Media business achieved the performance milestones contemplated by the first earnout and as a result we paid the sellers million of additional consideration. The estimated fair value is based on unobservable inputs and is therefore a Level 3 fair value. The Company s valuation was based on an income approach, which utilized Monte Carlo simulations that included expected payoff estimates calculated based on various discounted cash flow valuations.

The first ASR program was completed during the third quarter of 2023 at which time JPMorgan delivered an additional million shares to us. The final share settlement was based on the average daily volume-weighted average price of TEGNA shares during the term of the first ASR program, less a discount, less the previously delivered million shares. On November 9, 2023, we entered into a second accelerated share repurchase (the second ASR) program with JPMorgan. Under the terms of the second ASR, we repurchased million in TEGNA common stock from JPMorgan, with an initial delivery of approximately million shares received on November 13, 2023, representing million) of the value of the second ASR contract. The second ASR program was completed on February 22, 2024, shortly after which date JPMorgan delivered an additional million shares to us. The final share settlement was based on the average daily volume-weighted average price of TEGNA shares during the term of the second ASR program, less a discount, less the previously delivered million shares. In December 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock, which was in addition to the second ASR program. This new share repurchase program expires on . In the third quarter of 2024, million shares were repurchased under this program at an average share price of for an aggregate cost of million. In the first nine months of 2024 , million shares were repurchased under this program at an average share price of for an aggregate cost of million. Of the shares repurchased in 2024, million had not yet been paid for as of the end of the third quarter. During the first nine months of 2024 , we returned million of capital to shareholders with million of share repurchases, representing million shares, and paid million in dividends. Our capital allocation plan is subject to a variety of factors, including our strategic plans, market and economic conditions and the discretion of our Board of Directors. 

other broadcasters settled a DOJ complaint alleging the exchange of certain competitively sensitive information in the broadcast television industry. In June 2019, we and other broadcasters entered into a substantially identical agreement with DOJ, which was entered by the court on December 3, 2019. The settlement contains no finding of wrongdoing or liability and carries no penalty. It prohibits us and the other settling entities from sharing certain confidential business information as alleged by the DOJ, or using such information pertaining to other broadcasters, except under limited circumstances. The settlement also requires the settling parties to make certain enhancements to their antitrust compliance programs, to continue to cooperate with the DOJ s investigation, and to permit DOJ to verify compliance. The costs of compliance have not been material, nor do we expect future compliance costs to be material. Since the national media reports, numerous putative class action lawsuits were filed against owners of television stations (the Advertising Cases) in different jurisdictions. Plaintiffs are a class consisting of all persons and entities in the United States who paid for all or a portion of advertisement time on local television provided by the defendants. The Advertising Cases assert antitrust and other claims and seek monetary damages, attorneys fees, costs and interest, as well as injunctions against the allegedly wrongful conduct. 

 16 

of the original complaints, the amended complaint did not name TEGNA as a defendant. After TEGNA and other broadcasters entered into the consent decrees with the DOJ in June 2019, the plaintiffs sought leave from the court to further amend the complaint to add TEGNA and the other settling broadcasters to the proceeding. The court granted the plaintiffs motion, and the plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint on September 9, 2019. On October 8, 2019, the defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss the matter. On November 6, 2020, the court denied the motion to dismiss. On March 16, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint, which, among other things, added ShareBuilders, Inc., as a named defendant. ShareBuilders filed a motion to dismiss on April 15, 2022, which was granted by the court without prejudice on August 29, 2022. TEGNA has filed its answer to the third amended complaint denying any violation of law and asserting various affirmative defenses. On May 26, 2023, plaintiffs moved for preliminary approval of settlements with co-defendants CBS Corp (n/k/a Paramount Global), Fox Corp., certain Cox entities (including Cox Media Group, LLC, Cox Enterprises, Inc., CMG Media Corporation and Cox Reps, Inc.) and ShareBuilders, Inc. Although ShareBuilders prevailed on its motion to dismiss the case, as noted above, because the court had dismissed the claims without prejudice, ShareBuilders entered into a -dollar settlement with the plaintiffs in order to ensure that the plaintiffs do not re-file the claims in the future. In exchange for a release of plaintiffs claims against them, the settling defendants, among other things, collectively agreed to pay million, while expressly denying any liability or wrongdoing. The court approved the settlements in December 2023 . Discovery in the Advertising Cases is ongoing. We believe that the claims asserted in the Advertising Cases are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against them. Other litigation matters We, along with a number of our subsidiaries, also are defendants in other judicial and administrative proceedings involving matters incidental to our business. We do not believe that any material liability will be imposed as a result of any of the foregoing matters. Related Party Transactions We have an equity investment in MadHive, Inc. (MadHive) which is a related party of TEGNA. We also have commercial agreements with MadHive, under which MadHive supports our Premion business in acquiring over-the-top advertising inventory and delivering corresponding advertising impressions. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 , we incurred expenses of million and million, respectively, as a result of the commercial agreement with MadHive. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 , we incurred expenses of million and million, respectively, as a result of the commercial agreements with MadHive. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 , we had accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with the MadHive commercial agreements of million and million, respectively.

Item 2. Managemen t s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Company Overview 
 
 We serve our local communities across the U.S. through trustworthy journalism, engaging content, and tools that help people navigate their daily lives. Through customized marketing solutions, we help businesses grow and thrive. With 64 television stations in 51 U.S. markets, we reach approximately 100 million people every month across the web, mobile apps, streaming, and linear television. We have been consistently honored with the industry s top awards, including Edward R. Murrow, George Polk, Alfred I. DuPont and Emmy Awards. We also own leading multicast networks True Crime Network and Quest. 
 
 We have one operating and reportable segment. The primary sources of our revenues are: 1) subscription revenues, reflecting fees paid by satellite, cable, over-the-top (OTT) (companies that deliver video content to consumers over the Internet) and telecommunications providers to carry our television signals on their systems; 2) advertising marketing services (AMS) revenues, which include local and national non-political television advertising, digital marketing services (including Premion), and advertising on the stations websites, tablet and mobile products and OTT apps; 3) political advertising revenues, which are driven by even year election cycles at the local and national level (e.g. 2022, 2024, etc.) and particularly in the second half of those years; and 4) other services, such as production of programming, tower rentals, and distribution of our local news content.

 Revenues 
 
 Our Subscription revenue category includes revenue earned from cable, satellite and telecommunication providers for the right to carry our signals and the distribution of TEGNA stations on OTT streaming services. Our AMS category includes all sources of our traditional television advertising and digital revenues, including Premion and other digital advertising and marketing revenues across our platforms. 
 
 18 

Our revenues and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Generally, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenues are stronger than those we report for the first and third quarters. This is driven by the second quarter reflecting increased spring seasonal advertising, while the fourth quarter typically includes increased advertising related to the holiday season. In addition, our revenue and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations across yearly periods resulting from political advertising. In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising for the local, state and national elections. Additionally, every four years, we typically experience even greater increases in political advertising in connection with the presidential election. The strong demand for advertising from political advertisers in these even years can result in the significant use of our available inventory (leading to a crowd out effect), which can diminish our AMS revenue in the even year of a two-year election cycle, particularly in the fourth quarter of those years. 
 
 The following table summarizes the year-over-year changes in our revenue categories (in thousands):

Not meaningful 
 
 Total revenues increased 93.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 46.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The net increases were primarily driven by an increase in political revenue 114.7 million third quarter, 162.9 million first nine months) reflecting increased spending on the upcoming elections. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in subscription revenue 21.7 million third quarter, 89.7 million first nine months) primarily due to declines in subscribers and for the nine-month period only, a temporary disruption of service with a distribution partner which was successfully resolved on January 13, 2024. These declines were partially offset by contractual rate increases under our retransmission agreements. For the third quarter, AMS revenue was up slightly driven by increased advertising related to the Summer Olympic Games partially offset by political crowd out. The underlying advertising trend improved due to demand from local accounts that outweighed continued softness from national accounts. For the nine month period only, AMS revenue was down 25.4 million due to continued softness in the national advertising market. 
 
 Cost of revenues 
 
 Cost of revenues decreased 0.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 4.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The third quarter decrease was primarily due to a 9.0 million decline in programming costs, partially offset by increases in payroll-related costs of 3.7 million, employee stock-based compensation of 1.2 million, and employee retention costs of 0.6 million. The increase for the first nine months was primarily due to increase in payroll-related costs of 11.9 million, employee stock-based compensation of 3.8 million, employee retention costs of 2.9 million, and workforce restructuring costs of 0.9 million. These increases were partially offset by a 15.0 million decline in programming costs. 
 
 Business units - Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 
 Business unit selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 0.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases were primarily due to declines in professional service costs partially offset by increases from payroll-related costs, employee retention costs, employee stock-based compensation, and workforce restructuring costs. 
 
 Corporate - General and administrative expenses 
 
 Our corporate costs are separated from our direct business expenses and are recorded as general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. This category primarily consists of corporate management and support functions including Legal, Human Resources, and Finance. 
 
 Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 0.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 11.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease for the first nine months was primarily due to declines in merger and acquisition (M A)-related costs of 17.6 million, partially offset by increases in employee retention costs of 4.2 million and workforce restructuring costs of 1.8 million. 
 
 Depreciation 
 
 Depreciation expense increased by 0.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 0.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 19 

Amortization of intangible assets 
 
 Intangible asset amortization expense increased 0.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 0.6 million in the nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Octillion Media acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in amortization due to certain intangible assets reaching the end of their assumed useful lives and therefore becoming fully amortized. 
 
 Asset impairment and other 
 
 Asset impairment and other expenses were 1.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 3.4 million in the first nine months of 2023. The 2024 activity was due to a contract termination fee. The 2023 activity was due to an impairment charge recognized on programming assets in the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Merger termination fee 
 
 On February 22, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the Merger Agreement), with Teton Parent Corp. On May 22, 2023, after a protracted regulatory review, we terminated the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. Per the terms of the Merger Agreement, we received 136.0 million as a result of this termination which was satisfied in TEGNA common stock and recorded as a reduction in operating expense. 
 
 Operating income 
 
 Operating income increased 95.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 80.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The third quarter increase was primarily driven by an increase in political revenue of 114.7 million. The decrease in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by the absence of the 136.0 million Merger termination fee, a decrease in subscription revenue of 89.7 million and a decline in AMS revenue of 25.4 million, partially offset by an increase in political revenue of 162.9 million. Non-GAAP operating income increased 103.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 53.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 due to the increases in political revenues, partially offset by declines in subscription revenues discussed above. For information on the nature and magnitude of items excluded from non-GAAP results, and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see the Results from Operations- Non-GAAP Information section. 
 
 Non-operating (expense) income 
 
 Non-operating expense increased 27.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in expense was primarily due to the absence in 2024 of a 25.8 million gain recognized on the sale of a portion of our MadHive investment in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, non-operating income increased 122.0 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 152.9 million gain recognized on the sale of our investment in Broadcast Music, Inc. in the first quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting this increase was the absence of the 25.8 million gain on the partial sale of our MadHive investment in 2023. 
 
 Provision for income taxes 
 
 Income tax expense increased 16.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Income tax expense increased 23.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increases were primarily due to increases in net income before tax and higher effective income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate was 23.3 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 22.4 for the third quarter of 2023. The tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 is higher than the comparable rate in 2023 primarily due to tax benefits recorded in 2023 associated with the release of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to an equity method investment. The tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 benefited from the purchase of federal clean energy tax credits. Our effective income tax rate was 23.3 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 20.6 for the same period in 2023. The tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 is higher than the comparable rate in 2023 primarily due to the 2023 tax rate being favorably impacted by the deduction of previously capitalized transaction costs resulting from the termination of the Merger Agreement and a portion of the Merger termination fee being treated as non-taxable. The tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 benefited from the purchase of federal clean energy tax credits and discrete tax benefits as a result of a favorable settlement of an IRS audit related to the 2016 and 2017 tax years. 
 
 20 

Net income attributable to TEGNA Inc. 
 
 Net income attributable to TEGNA Inc. was 147.4 million, or 0.89 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 96.2 million, or 0.48 per diluted share, during the same period in 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, net income attributable to TEGNA Inc. was 156.9 million, or 0.94 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 78.0 million, or 0.39 per diluted share, during the same period in 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, net income attributable to TEGNA Inc. was 419.2 million, or 2.44 per diluted share, compared to 400.6 million, or 1.86 per diluted share, during the same period of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, net income attributable to TEGNA Inc. was 323.2 million, or 1.88 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 282.2 million, or 1.31 per diluted share, during the same period in 2023. Both income and earnings per share, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, were affected by the factors discussed above. For information on the nature and magnitude of items excluded from non-GAAP results, and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see the Results from Operations- Non-GAAP Information section. 
 
 The weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were 165.7 million and 201.2 million, respectively. The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 171.3 million and 214.6 million, respectively. The decline in the number of diluted common shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases of 39.5 million under our ASR programs which began in the second quarter of 2023, the receipt of 8.6 million shares to satisfy the Merger termination fee which occurred in the second quarter of 2023 and share repurchases of 17.5 million shares from the third quarter of 2023 through the third quarter of 2024 under our authorized repurchase programs.

Results from Operations - Non-GAAP Information 
 
 Presentation of Non-GAAP information 
 
 The Company uses non-GAAP financial performance measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the related GAAP measures, nor should they be considered superior to the related GAAP measures and should be read together with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Also, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 
 Management and the Company s Board of Directors (the Board regularly use Corporate General and administrative expenses, Operating expenses, Operating income, Income before income taxes, Provision for income taxes, Net income attributable to TEGNA Inc., and Diluted earnings per share, each presented on a non-GAAP basis, for purposes of evaluating company performance. Management and the Board also use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate Company performance. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of our Board uses non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS to evaluate and compensate senior management. The Company, therefore, believes that each of the non-GAAP measures presented provides useful information to investors and other stakeholders by allowing them to view our business through the eyes of management and our Board, facilitating comparisons of results across historical periods and focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of our business. The Company also believes these non-GAAP measures are frequently used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in their evaluation of our business and other companies in the broadcast industry. 
 
 The Company discusses in this Form 10-Q non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude from its reported GAAP results the impact of special items which are described in detail below in the section titled Discussion of Special Charges and Credits Affecting Reported Results. The Company believes that such expenses and gains are not indicative of normal, ongoing operations. While these items should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods as these items can vary significantly from period to period depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may occur. Therefore, while we may incur or recognize these types of expenses, charges, and gains in the future, the Company believes that removing these items for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with a more focused presentation of our ongoing operating performance. 
 
 The Company also discusses Adjusted EBITDA (with and without stock-based compensation expense), a non-GAAP financial performance measure that it believes offers a useful view of the overall operation of its businesses. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to TEGNA before (1) net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, (2) income taxes, (3) interest expense, (4) interest income, (5) other non-operating items, net, (6) M A-related costs, (7) asset impairment and other, (8) workforce restructuring costs, (9) employee retention costs, (10) the Merger termination fee, (11) depreciation and (12) amortization of intangible assets. The Company believes these adjustments facilitate company-to-company operating performance comparisons by removing potential differences caused by variations unrelated to operating performance, such as capital structures (interest expense), income taxes, and the age and book appreciation of property and equipment (and related depreciation expense). The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA is Net income attributable to TEGNA. Users should consider the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA, including the fact that this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternate to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management s discretionary expenditures, as this measure does not consider certain cash requirements, such as working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual commitments, interest payments, tax payments and other debt service requirements. 
 
 Discussion of Special Charges and Credits Affecting Reported Results

 In the third quarter of 2024 Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33 with stock-based compensation expense or 35 without those expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28 with stock-based compensation expense or 29 without those expenses. Our total Adjusted EBITDA increased 103.6 million, or 62 , in the third quarter of 2024 and 54.2 million, or 10 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 2023. These increases were primarily driven by the operational factors discussed above within the revenue and operating expense fluctuation explanation sections, most notably, the increase in political revenue, partially offset by a decrease in subscription revenue. 
 
 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Cash Flows 
 
 Our operations have historically generated positive cash flow that, along with availability under our existing revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents on hand, has been sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, interest payments, dividends, share repurchases, investments in strategic initiatives and other operating requirements. 
 
 We paid dividends totaling 61.4 million and 63.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On May 8, 2024 we announced that our Board of Directors further increased the quarterly dividend by 10 , from 11.375 to 12.5 cents per share. This increase builds on a 20 percent increase to TEGNA s dividend in 2023. The most recent increase to the dividend took effect beginning with the July 1, 2024 dividend payment. 
 
 On June 2, 2023, we entered into our first accelerated share repurchase program (the first ASR) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMorgan). Under the terms of the first ASR, we repurchased 300 million in TEGNA common stock from JPMorgan, with an initial delivery of approximately 15.2 million shares received on June 6, 2023, representing 80 240 million) of the value of the first ASR contract. The first ASR program was completed during the third quarter of 2023 at which time JPMorgan delivered an additional 3.1 million shares to us. The final share settlement was based on the average daily volume-weighted average price of TEGNA shares during the term of the first ASR program, less a discount, less the previously delivered 15.2 million shares. 
 
 24 

On November 9, 2023, we entered into a second accelerated share repurchase (the second ASR) program with JPMorgan. Under the terms of the second ASR, we repurchased 325 million in TEGNA common stock from JPMorgan, with an initial delivery of approximately 17.3 million shares received on November 13, 2023, representing 80 260 million) of the value of the second ASR contract. The second ASR program was completed on February 22, 2024, shortly after which JPMorgan delivered an additional 4.0 million shares to us. The final share settlement was based on the average daily volume-weighted average price of TEGNA shares during the term of the second ASR program, less a discount, less the previously delivered 17.3 million shares. 
 
 In December 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 650.0 million of our common stock, which was in addition to the second ASR program. This share repurchase program expires on December 31, 2025. In the first nine months of 2024, 15.7 million shares were repurchased under this program at an average share price of 14.36 for an aggregate cost of 226.0 million, of which 1.0 million had not yet been paid as of the end of the third quarter. 
 
 Our comprehensive capital allocation framework supports shareholder value creation through a predictable and sustained distribution of free cash flow to shareholders. During the first nine months of 2024, we returned approximately 65 of Adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to expect to return 40-60 percent of our Adjusted free cash flow generated over 2024-2025 to shareholders. Remaining Adjusted free cash flow is expected to be used for organic investments and/or bolt-on acquisitions and to prepare for future debt retirement. We will continue to analyze all uses of capital, including regular evaluation of the dividend, with a goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value creation. 
 
 Consistent with this framework, we are on track to return approximately 350 million of capital to shareholders in 2024 through dividends and share repurchases from time to time on the open market at prevailing prices or in negotiated transactions. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we returned 286.4 million of capital to shareholders with 225.0 million of share repurchases, representing 15.7 million shares, and paid 61.4 million in dividends. 
 
 Our capital allocation plan is subject to a variety of factors, including our strategic plans, market and economic conditions and the discretion of our Board of Directors. 
 
 In addition to the above share repurchase initiatives, during 2024 we deployed surplus cash in time deposit and money market investments with several financial institutions. 
 
 On January 25, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility. Among other things, the amendment amends the revolving credit facility to: 
 
 Reduce the Five-Year Commitments (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from 1.51 billion to 750 million; 

Extend the term of such Five-Year Commitments from August 15, 2024 to January 25, 2029, subject to a 91-day springing maturity date if debt in excess of 300 million (subject to certain exceptions) were to mature before such date; 

Add the right to obtain a temporary 0.5x step-up in the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) after consummating a Qualified Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement); 

Increase the amount of Unrestricted Cash (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 600 million; 

Amend the definition of Consolidated EBITDA to include an add-back for certain professional fees and expenses; and 

Establish a 50 million swingline facility. 

Under the amended Credit Agreement, the Company s maximum Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) will remain unchanged at 4.50x. None of the available capacity on the revolving credit facility was drawn on the amendment date. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt agreements and credit facility. Our leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our revolving Credit Agreement, was 2.79x, below the maximum permitted leverage ratio of 4.50x. The leverage ratio is calculated using annualized adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing eight quarters. We expect to remain compliant with all covenants for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, our total debt was 3.08 billion, cash and cash equivalents totaled 536.3 million, and we had unused borrowing capacity of 737.9 million under our revolving credit facility after reducing for outstanding letters of credit. Our debt consists of unsecured notes which have fixed interest rates. 
 
 Our financial and operating performance, as well as our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to maintain compliance with credit facility covenants, are subject to certain risk factors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, expected future cash flow from our operations, and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will be more than sufficient to satisfy our recurring contractual commitments, debt service obligations, capital expenditure requirements, and other working capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond.

Operating activities - Cash flow from operating activities was 435.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 408.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in operating cash flow of 26.4 million was primarily due to an increase in net income of 18.1 million mainly due to an increase in political revenue. Also driving the increase was a decrease in cash paid for income taxes of 25.8 million, driven in part by the utilization of purchased clean energy tax credits to reduce estimated income tax payments in the first nine months of 2024. Payment for these tax credits will be made primarily in the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase was partially offset by a 32.7 million change in accounts payable driven by the timing of payments. 
 
 Investing activities - Cash flow from investing activities was a net cash inflow of 49.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net cash outflow of 3.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net cash flows of 52.2 million from investing activities was primarily driven by a 129.7 million increase in proceeds from investments, primarily driven by 152.9 million of proceeds from the sale of our investment in BMI in the first quarter of 2024. Proceeds in 2023 were primarily related to 26.4 million of cash received from the sale of a portion of our investment in MadHive. This increase was partially offset by cash outflows of 52.8 million for the acquisition of Octillion Media in 2024 and a 19.0 million increase in 2024 in payments made for debt and equity investments. 
 
 Financing activities - Cash flow used for financing activities was 309.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 404.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to our repurchase of common stock, which included a 300.0 million ASR program payment in the second quarter of 2023 that did not recur in 2024. In the first nine months of 2024 we repurchased 225.0 million of common stock on the open market under our authorized share repurchase program, as compared to repurchases of 27.9 million in the first nine months of 2023.
