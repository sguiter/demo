) ) ) Weighted-average Vail Shares outstanding Effect of dilutive securities Total shares Net loss per share attributable to Vail Resorts ) ) ) ) 
 The Company computes the effect of dilutive securities using the treasury stock method and average market prices during the period. The number of shares issuable upon the exercise of share-based awards excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive totaled approximately million for both the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 In December 2020, the Company completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of 0.0 Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 5, Long-Term Debt). The Company is required to settle the principal amount of the 0.0 Convertible Notes in cash and has the option to settle the conversion spread in cash or shares. The Company uses the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted EPS when the instruments may be settled in cash or shares. If the conversion value of the 0.0 Convertible Notes exceeds their conversion price, then the Company will calculate its diluted EPS as if all the notes were converted into common stock at the beginning of the period. However, if reflecting the 0.0 Convertible Notes in diluted EPS in this manner is anti-dilutive, or if the conversion value of the notes does not exceed their conversion price for a reporting period, then the shares underlying the notes will not be reflected in the Company s calculation of diluted EPS. For the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the price of Vail Shares did not exceed the conversion price and therefore there was no impact to diluted EPS during those periods.

 (a) Vail Holdings, Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, along with other certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain Lenders are party to the Ninth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement ), which has a maturity date of April 24, 2029 for both the currently undrawn revolver facility and the term loan facility, which had an outstanding balance of million as of October 31, 2024. The term loan is subject to quarterly amortization of principal of approximately million, in equal installments, for a total of 5 of principal payable in each year and the final payment of all amounts outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest is due upon maturity in April 2029. The proceeds of the loans made under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement may be used to fund the Company s working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement, including the term loan, bear interest annually at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a spread of as of October 31, 2024 as of October 31, 2024). Interest rate margins may fluctuate based upon the ratio of the Company s Net Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing four-quarter basis. The Vail Holdings Credit Agreement also includes a quarterly unused commitment fee, which is equal to a percentage determined by the Net Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, as each such term is defined in the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement, multiplied by the daily amount by which the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement commitment exceeds the total of outstanding loans and outstanding letters of credit as of October 31, 2024).

 In connection with the acquisition of Whistler Blackcomb, VHI funded a portion of the purchase price through an intercompany loan to Whistler Blackcomb, which was effective as of November 1, 2016, and requires foreign currency remeasurement to Canadian dollars, the functional currency for Whistler Blackcomb. As a result, foreign currency fluctuations associated with the loan are recorded within the Company s results of operations.

 ownership stake in Romont es M caniques Crans Montana Aminona SA CMA ), which controls and operates all of the lifts and supporting mountain operations, including four retail and rental locations; (ii) 100 ownership of SportLife AG, which operates one of the ski schools located at the resort; and (iii) 100 ownership of 11 restaurants located on and around the mountain. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. As of May 2, 2024 the total fair value of the consideration paid was million (CHF million). 
 Portions of the Crans-Montana resort operations are conducted on land owned by third parties via numerous registered easements, building rights (which may be subject to federal concessions), or other agreements. The municipality of Crans-Montana, the municipality of Lens and CPIPG collectively retained in total an approximate 16 ownership stake in CMA. The Company entered into a shareholders agreement with the municipalities of Crans-Montana and Lens (the Crans Agreement for an initial fixed term until December 31, 2035. Thereafter, the Crans Agreement shall continue to be in effect for successive renewal periods of ten years unless terminated by either the Company or the municipalities acting jointly. The Crans Agreement provides for various terms and conditions in relation to the election and governance of the board of directors, company policies, dividends, financial aspects and related matters. The noncontrolling shares may be traded without restriction. 
 Estimated fair value of noncontrolling interests Total estimated purchase consideration Allocation of total estimated purchase consideration: Current assets Property, plant and equipment Goodwill Identifiable intangible assets and other assets Liabilities ) Net assets acquired 
 Identifiable intangible assets acquired in the transaction were primarily related to a trade name. The process of estimating the fair value of the property, plant, and equipment includes the use of certain estimates and assumptions related to replacement cost and physical condition at the time of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to expected synergies, the assembled workforce of the resort and other factors, and is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The operating results of Crans-Montana are reported within the Mountain segment prospectively from the date of acquisition. 
 The estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Crans-Montana are preliminary and are based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date. The Company believes that this information provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; however, the Company may obtain additional information necessary to finalize those estimated fair values. Therefore, the preliminary measurements of estimated fair values reflected are subject to change. The Company expects to finalize the valuation and complete the purchase consideration allocation no later than one year from the acquisition date.

 The Company s cash equivalents, restricted cash, other current assets and interest rate swaps are measured utilizing quoted market prices or pricing models whereby all significant inputs are either observable or corroborated by observable market data. The interest rate swaps expired on September 23, 2024 and therefore had no estimated fair value as of October 31, 2024. The estimated fair value of the interest rate swaps was included within other current assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 31, 2024 and Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2023.

The Company prepared a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect that changes on certain key assumptions would have on the estimated fair value of the Contingent Consideration. 
 During the three months ended October 31, 2024, the Company made a payment to the landlord for Contingent Consideration of approximately million and recorded an increase in the liability of approximately million, primarily related to the estimated Contingent Consideration payment for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2025. These changes resulted in an estimated fair value of the Contingent Consideration of approximately million, which is reflected in other long-term liabilities in the Company s Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet.

 million, consisting of million to support the Employee Housing Bonds; million to support bonds issued by Holland Creek Metropolitan District; and million of other standby letters of credit primarily related to insurance-related deductibles, a wind energy purchase agreement, and workers compensation. The Company also had surety bonds of million as of October 31, 2024, primarily to provide collateral for its U.S. workers compensation self-insurance programs. 
 In addition to the guarantees noted above, the Company has entered into contracts in the normal course of business that include certain indemnifications under which it could be required to make payments to third parties upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain future events. These indemnities include indemnities related to licensees in connection with third-parties use of the Company s trademarks and logos, liabilities associated with the infringement of other parties technology and software products, liabilities associated with the use of easements, liabilities associated with employment of contract workers and the Company s use of trustees and liabilities associated with the Company s use of public lands and environmental matters. The duration of these indemnities generally is indefinite and generally do not limit the future payments the Company could be obligated to make. 
 As permitted under applicable law, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify their directors and officers over their lifetimes for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving the Company or its subsidiaries in such a capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that should enable the Company to recover a portion of any amounts paid. 
 Unless otherwise noted, the Company has not recorded any significant liabilities for the letters of credit, indemnities and other guarantees noted above in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, either because the Company has recorded on its Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets the underlying liability associated with the guarantee, the guarantee is with respect to the Company s own performance and is therefore not subject to the measurement requirements as prescribed by GAAP, or because the Company has calculated the estimated fair value of the indemnification or guarantee to be immaterial based on the current facts and circumstances that would trigger a payment under the indemnification clause. In addition, with respect to certain indemnifications it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these potential obligations due to the unique set of facts and circumstances likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by the Company under these obligations have not been material. 
 As noted above, the Company makes certain indemnifications to licensees for their use of the Company s trademarks and logos. The Company does not record any liabilities with respect to these indemnifications.

 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 Form 10-K and the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements as of October 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the three months then ended, included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, which provide additional information regarding our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that the following MD A contains statements which are not of a historical nature, such statements are forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements below. These risks include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), including the risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of our Form 10-K, which was filed on September 26, 2024. 
 
 The MD A includes discussion of financial performance within each of our three segments. We have chosen to specifically include segment Reported EBITDA (defined as segment net revenue less segment operating expense, plus segment equity investment income or loss, and for the Real Estate segment, plus gain or loss on sale of real property) in the following discussion because we consider this measurement to be a significant indication of our financial performance. We utilize segment Reported EBITDA in evaluating our performance and in allocating resources to our segments. Net Debt (defined as long-term debt, net plus long-term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents) is included in the following discussion because we consider this measurement to be a significant indication of our available capital resources. We also believe that Net Debt is an important measurement as it is an indicator of our ability to obtain additional capital resources for our future cash needs. Resort Reported EBITDA (defined as the combination of segment Reported EBITDA of our Mountain and Lodging segments), Total Reported EBITDA (which is Resort Reported EBITDA plus segment Reported EBITDA from our Real Estate segment) and Net Debt are not measures of financial performance or liquidity defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). Refer to the end of the Results of Operations section for a reconciliation of net loss attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. to Total Reported EBITDA and Resort Reported EBITDA, and long-term debt, net to Net Debt. 
 
 Items excluded from Resort Reported EBITDA, Total Reported EBITDA and Net Debt are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance or liquidity. Resort Reported EBITDA, Total Reported EBITDA and Net Debt should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net loss, net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Resort Reported EBITDA, Total Reported EBITDA and Net Debt are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, Resort Reported EBITDA, Total Reported EBITDA and Net Debt, as presented herein, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. In addition, our segment Reported EBITDA (i.e., Mountain, Lodging and Real Estate), the measure of segment profit or loss required to be disclosed in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 
 Overview 
 Our operations are grouped into three integrated and interdependent segments: Mountain, Lodging and Real Estate. We refer to Resort as the combination of the Mountain and Lodging segments. 
 
 19 

Mountain Segment 
 In the Mountain segment, the Company operates the following 42 destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas (collectively, Resorts ). 
 
 Denotes a destination mountain resort, which generally receives a meaningful portion of skier visits from long-distance travelers, as opposed to our regional ski areas, which tend to generate skier visits predominantly from their respective local markets. 
 
 Additionally, the Mountain segment includes ancillary services, primarily including ski school, dining and retail/rental operations, and for our Australian ski areas, including lodging and transportation operations. Mountain segment revenue is seasonal, with the majority of revenue earned from our North American and European ski operations occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters and the majority of revenue earned from our Australian ski operations occurring in our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Our North American and European Resorts typically experience their peak operating season for the Mountain segment from mid-December through mid-April, and our Australian ski areas typically experience their peak operating season from June to earl y October . Consequently, our first and fourth fiscal quarters are seasonally low periods as most of our North American and European ski operations are generally not open for business, and the activity of our Australian ski areas peak season and our North American and European summer operating results are not sufficient to offset the losses incurred during these seasonally low periods. Revenue of the Mountain segment during the first and fourth fiscal quarters is primarily generated from summer and group related visitation at our North American and European destination mountain resorts, retail/rental operations and peak season Australian ski operations. 
 
 Lodging Segment 
 Operations within the Lodging segment include: (i) ownership/management of a group of luxury hotels through the RockResorts brand proximate to our Colorado and Utah mountain resorts; (ii) ownership/management of non-RockResorts branded hotels and condominiums proximate to our North American Resorts; (iii) National Park Service NPS concessioner properties, including the Grand Teton Lodge Company GTLC (iv) a Colorado resort ground transportation company; and (v) mountain resort golf courses. 
 
 Revenue of the lodging segment during our first fiscal quarter is generated primarily by the operations of our NPS concessioner properties (as their peak operating season generally occurs during the months of June to October), as well as golf operations and seasonally low operations from our other owned and managed properties and businesses. Lodging properties (including managed condominium rooms) at or around our mountain resorts, and our Colorado resort ground transportation company, are closely aligned with the performance of the Mountain segment and generally experience similar seasonal trends. Management primarily focuses on Lodging net revenue excluding payroll cost reimbursements and Lodging operating expense excluding reimbursed payroll costs (which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP) as the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin and as such, the revenue and corresponding expense do not affect our Lodging Reported EBITDA, which we use to evaluate Lodging segment performance. 
 
 20 

Real Estate Segment 
 The principal activities of our Real Estate segment include the sale of land parcels to third-party developers and planning for future real estate development projects, including zoning and acquisition of applicable permits. We continue undertaking preliminary planning and design work on future projects and are pursuing opportunities with third-party developers rather than undertaking our own significant vertical development projects. Additionally, real estate development projects by third-party developers most often result in the creation of certain resort assets that provide additional benefit to the Mountain segment. We believe that, due to our low carrying cost of real estate land investments, we are well situated to promote future projects by third-party developers while limiting our financial risk. Our revenue from the Real Estate segment and associated expense can fluctuate significantly based upon the timing of closings and the type of real estate being sold, causing volatility in the Real Estate segment s operating results from period to period. 

Recent Trends, Risks and Uncertainties 
 Together with those risk factors we have identified in our Form 10-K, we have identified the following important factors (as well as risks and uncertainties associated with such factors) that could impact our future financial performance or condition: 
 
 Overall weather conditions, including the timing and amount of snowfall, can have an impact on Mountain and Lodging revenue, particularly with regard to skier visits and the duration and frequency of guest visitation. To help mitigate this impact, we sell a variety of pass products prior to the beginning of the ski season, which results in a more stabilized stream of lift revenue. Additionally, our pass products provide a compelling value proposition to our guests, which in turn create a guest commitment predominately prior to the start of the ski season. Pass product sales through December 3, 2024 for the upcoming 2024/2025 North American ski season decreased approximately 2 in units and increased approximately 4 in sales dollars as compared to the period in the prior year through December 4, 2023. Pass product sales are adjusted to eliminate the impact of foreign currency by applying an exchange rate of 0.71 between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar in both periods for Whistler Blackcomb pass sales. We cannot predict the overall impact that sales of our pass products will have on total lift revenue or effective ticket price for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2025. 
 
 The economies in the countries in which we operate and from which we attract our guests may be impacted by economic challenges associated with elevated inflation, prolonged elevated interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, political uncertainty and financial institution disruptions and/or fluctuating commodity prices that could adversely impact our business, including decreased guest spending or visitation or increased costs of operations. Skiing, travel and tourism are discretionary recreational activities that can entail a relatively high cost of participation. As a result, economic downturns and other negative impacts to consumer discretionary spending may have a pronounced impact on visitation to our Resorts. We cannot predict the extent to which we may be impacted by such potential economic challenges, whether in North America or globally. 
 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had 403.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as 407.4 million available under the revolver component of our Ninth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 24, 2024 (the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement ), which represents the total commitment of 500.0 million less certain letters of credit outstanding of 92.6 million. Additionally, we have a credit facility which supports the liquidity needs of Whistler Blackcomb (the Whistler Credit Agreement ). As of October 31, 2024, we had C 296.6 million 213.0 million) available under the revolver component of the Whistler Credit Agreement, which represents the total commitment of C 300.0 million 215.5 million) less letters of credit outstanding of C 3.4 million 2.5 million). We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, availability under our credit agreements and the expected positive cash flow from operating activities of our Mountain and Lodging segments less resort capital expenditures will continue to provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our operations.

Mountain Segment 
 Three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 
 Mountain segment operating results for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 are presented by category as follows (in thousands, except effective ticket price ETP )). ETP is calculated as lift revenue divided by total skier visits for each applicable period presented. 
 Three Months Ended October 31, Percentage Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Mountain net revenue: Lift 40,423 45,390 (10.9) Ski school 6,839 7,178 (4.7) Dining 20,628 18,077 14.1 Retail/rental 29,526 33,474 (11.8) Other 75,880 68,336 11.0 Total Mountain net revenue 173,296 172,455 0.5 Mountain operating expense: Labor and labor-related benefits 118,530 112,049 5.8 Retail cost of sales 15,031 17,821 (15.7) General and administrative 92,568 93,168 (0.6) Other 93,380 89,801 4.0 Total Mountain operating expense 319,509 312,839 2.1 Mountain equity investment income, net 2,151 859 150.4 Mountain Reported EBITDA (144,062) (139,525) (3.3) Total skier visits 548 658 (16.7) ETP 73.76 68.98 6.9 
 Mountain Reported EBITDA includes 5.8 million of stock-based compensation expense for each of the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Our first fiscal quarter historically results in negative Mountain Reported EBITDA, as most of our North American and European Resorts generally do not open for ski operations until our second fiscal quarter, which begins in November. The first 
 22 

fiscal quarter generally consists of operating and administrative expenses, North American and European summer activities (including dining), retail/rental operations and the winter operations of our Australian ski areas, for which the ski season generally occurs from June through early October. 
 
 Mountain Reported EBITDA decreased 4.5 million, or 3.3 , primarily driven by our Australian operations, which experienced weather-related challenges that impacted terrain and resulted in early closures, as well as incremental off-season losses from the addition of Crans-Montana (acquired May 2, 2024), partially offset by an increase in summer operations at our North American resorts, which benefited from warm weather conditions late in the season. Mountain segment results also include one-time operating expenses attributable to our resource efficiency transformation plan of 2.0 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024, as well as acquisition and integration related expenses of 0.9 million and 1.8 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Lift revenue decreased 5.0 million, or 10.9 , primarily due to decreased pass product sales for the 2024 Australian ski season, as well as a decrease in paid lift revenue at our Australian resorts as a result of reduced visitation from weather-related challenges that impacted terrain and resulted in early closures in the current year. 
 
 Dining revenue increased 2.6 million, or 14.1 , primarily as a result of an increased number of summer group events, as well as an increase in guest spending per visit at our North American resorts. Retail/rental revenue decreased 3.9 million, or 11.8 , driven by the impact of broader industry-wide customer spending trends which negatively impacted retail demand, particularly at our Colorado city store locations. 
 
 Other revenue mainly consists of summer visitation and other mountain activities revenue, employee housing revenue, guest services revenue, commercial leasing revenue, marketing revenue, private club revenue (which includes both club dues and amortization of initiation fees), municipal services revenue and other recreation activity revenue. Other revenue also includes Australian ski area lodging and transportation revenue. Other revenue increased 7.5 million, or 11.0 , primarily driven by an increase in other on-mountain summer activities and sightseeing revenue from the impact of increased summer visitation at our North American resorts as a result of improved weather conditions. 
 
 Operating expense increased 6.7 million, or 2.1 , which includes the incremental operating expenses from Crans-Montana and one-time costs attributable to our resource efficiency transformation plan of 2.0 million. Operating expense also includes acquisition and integration related expenses of 0.9 million and 1.8 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Labor and labor-related benefits increased 5.8 , primarily due to normal wage adjustments and an increase in labor expense to support increased North American summer operations, as well as incremental expenses from Crans-Montana of 2.3 million. Retail cost of sales decreased 15.7 , compared to a decrease in retail sales of 13.5 . Other expense increased 4.0 , primarily due to incremental expenses from Crans-Montana of 2.2 million, one-time costs attributable to our resource efficiency transformation plan of 2.0 million and an increase in acquisition and integration related expenses of 0.9 million. 
 
 Mountain equity investment income, net primarily includes our share of income from the operations of a real estate brokerage company.

Lodging Segment 
 Three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 
 Lodging segment operating results for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 are presented by category as follows (in thousands, except average daily rates ADR and revenue per available room RevPAR )): 
 Three Months Ended October 31, Percentage Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Lodging net revenue: Owned hotel rooms 28,075 25,177 11.5 Managed condominium rooms 11,705 12,003 (2.5) Dining 19,952 18,083 10.3 Golf 7,550 6,376 18.4 Other 16,501 16,723 (1.3) 83,783 78,362 6.9 Payroll cost reimbursements 3,133 3,459 (9.4) Total Lodging net revenue 86,916 81,821 6.2 Lodging operating expense: Labor and labor-related benefits 37,227 37,475 (0.7) General and administrative 14,289 14,857 (3.8) Other 27,910 26,266 6.3 79,426 78,598 1.1 Reimbursed payroll costs 3,133 3,459 (9.4) Total Lodging operating expense 82,559 82,057 0.6 Lodging Reported EBITDA 4,357 (236) 1,946.2 Owned hotel statistics: ADR 315.97 304.03 3.9 RevPAR 178.87 158.97 12.5 Managed condominium statistics: ADR 232.00 233.92 (0.8) RevPAR 53.07 50.78 4.5 Owned hotel and managed condominium statistics (combined): ADR 276.02 269.31 2.5 RevPAR 92.03 82.95 10.9 
 Lodging Reported EBITDA includes 0.8 million and 0.9 million of stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Lodging Reported EBITDA increased 4.6 million, primarily driven by favorable weather conditions which drove increased visitation at GTLC and our mountain resort properties. 
 Revenue from owned hotel rooms increased 2.9 million, or 11.5 , primarily due to increased visitation at GTLC driven by favorable weather conditions, which also drove an increase in ADR, as well as stronger demand for summer lodging at our North American mountain resort properties. Dining revenue increased 1.9 million, or 10.3 , and golf revenue increased 1.2 million, or 18.4 , each primarily as a result of increased summer visitation at our North American mountain resort properties. 
 Other expense increased 6.3 , primarily due to one-time costs attributable to our resource efficiency transformation plan of 0.7 million, as well as increased utilities and maintenance expenses of 0.6 million. 
 Revenue from payroll cost reimbursement and the corresponding reimbursed payroll costs relate to payroll costs at managed hotel properties where we are the employer and all payroll costs are reimbursed by the owners of the properties under 
 24 

contractual arrangements. Since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin, the revenue and corresponding expense have no effect on our Lodging Reported EBITDA. 
 
 Real Estate Segment 
 Our Real Estate net revenue is primarily determined by the timing of closings and the mix of real estate sold in any given period. Different types of projects have different revenue and profit margins; therefore, as the real estate inventory mix changes, it can greatly impact Real Estate segment net revenue, operating expense, gain or loss on sale of real property and Real Estate Reported EBITDA. 
 
 Three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 
 Real Estate segment operating results for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 are presented by category as follows (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended October 31, Percentage Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Total Real Estate net revenue 63 4,289 (98.5) Real Estate operating expense: Cost of sales 3,607 (100.0) Other 1,491 1,574 (5.3) Total Real Estate operating expense 1,491 5,181 (71.2) Gain on sale of real property 16,506 6,285 162.6 Real Estate Reported EBITDA 15,078 5,393 179.6 
 
 During the three months ended October 31, 2024, we recorded a gain on sale of real property for 16.5 million related to the resolution of the October 2023 Eagle County District Court final ruling and valuation regarding the Town of Vail s condemnation of our East Vail property. During the three months ended October 31, 2023, we closed on the sale of a land parcel in Keystone, Colorado for 4.2 million, which was recorded within Real Estate net revenue, with a corresponding cost of sale of 3.6 million. Additionally, we recorded a gain on sale of real property for 6.3 million related to a land parcel sale in Beaver Creek, Colorado, which closed for proceeds of 6.5 million during the three months ended October 31, 2023. 
 
 Other operating expense for both the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 was primarily comprised of general and administrative costs, such as labor and labor-related benefits, professional services and corporate overhead costs. 

Other Items 
 In addition to segment operating results, the following material items contributed to our overall financial results for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended October 31, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Benefit from income taxes 58,249 65,160 (10.6) Effective tax rate 24.3 26.3 (2.0) pts 
 
 Benefit from income taxes. At the end of each interim period, the Company estimates the annual effective tax rate and applies that rate to its ordinary quarterly earnings. The tax expense or benefit related to significant, unusual or extraordinary items that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effect are individually computed and recognized in the interim period in which those items occur. In addition, the effects of changes in enacted tax laws or rates or tax status are recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs. The effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 24.3 , compared to 26.3 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. 
 
 The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in favorable discrete items impacting the first quarter tax provision in the current period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Changes in significant sources of cash for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 are presented by categories as follows (in thousands). 
 Three Months Ended October 31, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 282,424 328,499 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (71,006) 5,565 Net cash used in financing activities (132,302) (153,608) 
 
 Three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023 
 We generated 282.4 million of cash from operating activities during the three months ended October 31, 2024, a decrease of 46.1 million compared to 328.5 million generated during the three months ended October 31, 2023. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily a result of (i) an increase in income tax payments of approximately 24.9 million for the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year, driven by overpayments and other deductions which offset our estimated 
 26 

payments made during the three months ended October 31, 2023 and higher estimated taxable income for the current fiscal year, and (ii) the timing of payments for accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and inventory. 
 
 The decrease in cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended October 31, 2024 of 76.6 million was primarily due to (i) the maturity of short-term bank deposits in the prior year which had maturity dates of more than three months at the date of purchase and were therefore not reflected as cash equivalents as of July 31, 2023, of which 52.4 million matured during the three months ended October 31, 2023, and (ii) an increase in capital expenditures of approximately 17.6 million as compared to the prior year, which is largely driven by an acceleration of the timing of work being completed and associated payments taking place in the current year. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities decreased by 21.3 million during the three months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of common stock of 30.0 million. 
 
 Significant Sources of Cash 
 We had 403.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2024, compared to 728.9 million as of October 31, 2023, and the decrease was primarily attributable to the cash purchase price associated with the acquisition of Crans-Montana, net of cash acquired, and share repurchases completed during the last twelve months. We currently anticipate that our Mountain and Lodging segment operating results will continue to provide a significant source of future operating cash flows (primarily generated in our second and third fiscal quarters). 
 
 In addition to our 403.8 million of cash and cash equivalents at October 31, 2024, we had 407.4 million available under the revolver component of our Vail Holdings Credit Agreement as of October 31, 2024 (which represents the total commitment of 500.0 million less outstanding letters of credit of 92.6 million). Additionally, we had C 296.6 million 213.0 million) available under the revolver component of our Whistler Credit Agreement (which represents the total commitment of C 300.0 million 215.5 million) less certain outstanding letters of credit of C 3.4 million 2.5 million). We expect that our liquidity needs in the near term will be met by continued use of our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and borrowings under both the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and Whistler Credit Agreement, if needed. The Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and the Whistler Credit Agreement provide adequate flexibility with any new borrowings currently priced at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.60 and Bankers Acceptance Rate plus 1.75 , respectively. 
 
 Significant Uses of Cash 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We have historically invested significant amounts of cash in capital expenditures for our resort operations, and we expect to continue to do so, subject to operating performance particularly as it relates to discretionary projects. Currently planned capital expenditures primarily include investments that will allow us to maintain our high-quality standards for the guest experience, as well as certain incremental discretionary improvements at our Resorts, throughout our owned hotels and in technology that can impact the full network. We evaluate additional discretionary capital improvements based on an expected level of return on investment. 
 
 We currently anticipate that we will spend approximately 189 million to 194 million on resort capital expenditures during calendar year 2024, excluding 13 million of incremental capital investments in premium fleet and fulfillment infrastructure to support the official launch of My Epic Gear for the 2024/2025 winter season at 12 destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas across North America, 7 million of growth capital investments at Andermatt-Sedrun, investments at Crans-Montana, which we expect will include 2 million of maintenance capital expenditures and 2 million associated with integration activities at Crans-Montana, and 3 million of reimbursable capital. Including My Epic Gear premium fleet, fulfillment infrastructure capital, investments at Crans-Montana, and one-time investments, our total capital plan for calendar year 2024 is expected to be approximately 216 million to 221 million. Included in these estimated capital expenditures are approximately 117 million to 122 million of maintenance capital expenditures (excluding Crans-Montana), which are necessary to maintain appearance and level of service appropriate to our resorts. We currently plan to utilize cash on hand, borrowings available under our credit agreements and/or cash flow generated from future operations to provide the cash necessary to complete our capital plans. 
 Approximately 152 million was spent for capital expenditures in calendar year 2024 as of October 31, 2024, leaving approximately 37 million to 42 million to spend in the remainder of calendar year 2024. 
 27 

Debt 
 As of October 31, 2024, principal payments on the majority of our long-term debt 2.0 billion of the total 2.8 billion debt outstanding as of October 31, 2024) are not due until fiscal year 2029 and beyond. As of both October 31, 2024 and 2023, total long-term debt, net (including long-term debt due within one year) was 2.8 billion. Net Debt (defined as long-term debt, net plus long-term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents) increased from 2.1 billion as of October 31, 2023 to 2.4 billion as of October 31, 2024, primarily due to the cash purchase price associated with the acquisition of Crans-Montana, net of cash acquired, and share repurchases completed during the last twelve months. 
 
 As of October 31, 2024, the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement provides for (i) a revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 500.0 million and (ii) a term loan of 947.5 million, and the Whistler Credit Agreement provides for a revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of C 300.0 million. We expect that our liquidity needs in the near term will be met by continued use of our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and borrowings under both the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and Whistler Credit Agreement, if needed. 
 
 Our debt service requirements can be impacted by changing interest rates as we had approximately 1.0 billion of variable-rate debt outstanding as of October 31, 2024. A 100-basis point change in our borrowing rates would cause our annual interest payments to change by approximately 10.0 million. Additionally, the annual payments associated with the financing of the Canyons Resort transaction increase by the greater of CPI less 1 , or 2 . The fluctuation in our debt service requirements, in addition to interest rate and inflation changes, may be impacted by future borrowings under our credit agreements or other alternative financing arrangements we may enter into. Our long term liquidity needs depend upon operating results that impact the borrowing capacity under our credit agreements. We can respond to liquidity impacts of changes in the business and economic environment by managing our capital expenditures, variable operating expenses, the timing of new real estate development activity and the payment of cash dividends on our common stock. 
 
 Dividend Payments 
 On December 5, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of 2.22 per share payable on January 9, 2025 to stockholders of record as of December 26, 2024. During the three months ended October 31, 2024, we paid cash dividends of 2.22 per share 83.1 million). During the three months ended October 31, 2023, we paid cash dividends of 2.06 per share 78.5 million). We funded these dividends with available cash on hand. The amount, if any, of dividends to be paid in the future will depend on our available cash on hand, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, restrictions contained in our Vail Holdings Credit Agreement, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 Our share repurchase program is conducted under authorizations made from time to time by our Board of Directors. On March 9, 2006, our Board of Directors initially authorized the repurchase of up to 3,000,000 shares of Vail Resorts common stock Vail Shares and later authorized additional repurchases of up to 3,000,000 Vail Shares (July 16, 2008), 1,500,000 Vail Shares (December 4, 2015), 2,500,000 Vail Shares (March 7, 2023), and 1,100,000 Vail Shares (September 25, 2024), for a total authorization to repurchase up to 11,100,000 Vail Shares. During the three months ended October 31, 2024, we repurchased 114,800 shares (at an average cost of 174.21) for a total cost of approximately 20.0 million, excluding accrued excise tax. During the three months ended October 31, 2023, we repurchased 237,056 Vail Shares (at an average cost of 210.92) for a total cost of approximately 50.0 million, excluding accrued excise tax. We funded the share repurchases with available cash on hand. Since inception of this stock repurchase program through October 31, 2024, we have repurchased 9,484,480 Vail Shares at a cost of approximately 1,149.4 million. As of October 31, 2024, 1,615,520 Vail Shares remained available to repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization. Vail Shares purchased pursuant to the repurchase program will be held as treasury shares and may be used for the issuance of shares under our share award plan. Repurchases under the program may be made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by applicable laws, and subject to market conditions and other factors. The timing as well as the number of Vail Shares that may be repurchased under the program will depend on several factors, including our future financial performance, our available cash resources and competing uses for cash that may arise in the future, the restrictions in our Vail Holdings Credit Agreement, prevailing prices of Vail Shares and the number of Vail Shares that become available for repurchase at prices that we believe are attractive. The share repurchase program has no expiration date. 
 28 

Covenants and Limitations 
 We must abide by certain restrictive financial covenants under our credit agreements. The most restrictive of those covenants include the following covenants: for the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement, Net Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, Secured Net Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio and the Interest Coverage ratio (each as defined in the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement); for the Whistler Credit Agreement, Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the Whistler Credit Agreement); and for the EPR Secured Notes, Maximum Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Fixed Charge Ratio (each as defined in the EPR Agreements). Additionally, the New Regional Policy loan between Andermatt-Sedrun and the Canton of Uri and Canton of Graub nden dated June 24, 2016 includes restrictive covenants requiring certain minimum financial results (as defined in the agreement). In addition, our financing arrangements limit our ability to make certain restricted payments, pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock, make certain investments and make certain affiliate transfers, and may limit our ability to enter into certain mergers, consolidations or sales of assets and incur certain indebtedness. Our borrowing availability under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement is primarily determined by the Net Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is based on our segment operating performance, as defined in the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement. Our borrowing availability under the Whistler Credit Agreement is primarily determined based on the commitment size of the credit facility and our compliance with the terms of the Whistler Credit Agreement. 
 
 We were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in our debt instruments as of October 31, 2024. We expect that we will meet all applicable financial maintenance covenants in effect in our credit agreements through the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance we will meet such financial covenants. If such covenants are not met, we would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the banks participating in the credit agreements. There can be no assurance that such waivers or amendments would be granted, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. 

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 We do not have off balance sheet transactions that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, revenue, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as reported in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024.

 All forward-looking statements attributable to us or any persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. 
 
 If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those expected, estimated or projected. Given these uncertainties, users of the information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-Q, including investors and prospective investors, are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements that we make for a number of reasons including those described above and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date hereof. Except as may be required by law, we do not intend to update these forward-looking statements, even if new information, future events or other circumstances have made them incorrect or misleading. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk is limited primarily to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness. As of October 31, 2024, we had approximately 1.0 billion of variable rate indebtedness, representing approximately 36.0 of our total debt outstanding, at an average interest rate during the three months ended October 31, 2024 of approximately 6.7 . Based on variable-rate borrowings outstanding as of October 31, 2024, a 100-basis point (or 1.0 
 30 

change in our borrowing rates would result in our annual interest payments changing by approximately 10.0 million. Our market risk exposure fluctuates based on changes in underlying interest rates. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. We are exposed to currency translation risk because the results of our international entities are reported in local currency, which we then translate to U.S. dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. As a result, changes between the foreign exchange rates, in particular the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Swiss franc compared to the U.S. dollar, affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative effect on our financial results. Additionally, we also have foreign currency transaction exposure from an intercompany loan to Whistler Blackcomb that is not deemed to be permanently invested, which has and could materially change due to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar exchange rate. The results of Whistler Blackcomb are reported in Canadian dollars, the results of our Australian resorts are reported in Australian dollars and the results of our Swiss resorts are reported in Swiss francs, each of which we then translate to U.S. dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. We do not currently enter into hedging arrangements to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our operations. 
 
 The following table summarizes the amounts of foreign currency translation adjustments, representing losses, and foreign currency loss on intercompany loans recognized in comprehensive loss (in thousands). 
 Three Months Ended October 31, 2024 2023 Foreign currency translation adjustments (3,854) (92,094) Foreign currency loss on intercompany loans (264) (4,965) 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management of the Company, under the supervision and with participation of the Chief Executive Officer (the CEO and Chief Financial Officer (the CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Based upon their evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the CEO and the CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. 
 The Company, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company s controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are a party to various lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that we have adequate insurance coverage and/or have accrued for all loss contingencies for asserted and unasserted matters and that, although the ultimate outcome of such claims cannot be ascertained, current pending and threatened claims are not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
