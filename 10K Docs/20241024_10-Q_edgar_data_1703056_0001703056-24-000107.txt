 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenant and other maintenance tests for all of its debt obligations. 
 Significant changes in the Company s debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 First Lien Credit Agreement 
 The Company s first lien credit agreement, dated as of July 1, 2015 (together with subsequent amendments and restatements, the First Lien Credit Agreement ), contains a term loan (the First Lien Term Loan B due 2030 and the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed million and repaid million under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility; and as of September 30, 2024, the available borrowing capacity was million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were borrowings or repayments under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Significant amendments to the First Lien Credit Agreement since December 31, 2023 are as follows: 
 April 2024 - The Company amended and restated the First Lien Credit Agreement, which reduced the interest rate on the First Lien Term Loan B due 2030 from Term SOFR + to Term SOFR + . 
 17 

ADT INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 

 million principal amount of loans under the Company s Term Loan A Facility for its First Lien Term Loan B due 2030. In addition, later that month, the Company further amended and restated the First Lien Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the Company incurred an additional million of outstanding principal under the First Lien Term Loan B due 2030 with the proceeds used to pay off the remaining outstanding balance of the Company s Term Loan A Facility. 
 Subsequent event - In October 2024, the Company amended and restated the First Lien Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility to October 2029 (as extended, the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility ), subject to a springing maturity of days prior to the maturity date of certain long-term indebtedness, and obtain an additional million of Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility commitments. After giving effect to the amendment, the aggregate amount of commitments under the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility is million. Borrowings under the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to either (a) Term SOFR with a floor of zero or (b) a base rate Base Rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus per annum, (ii) the rate of interest per annum last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the Prime Rate in the United States and (iii) the one-month adjusted term SOFR plus per annum, in each case, plus an applicable margin of per annum for Term SOFR loans and per annum for Base Rate loans, subject to two step-downs based on certain specified net first lien leverage ratios. In addition, the amendment reduced the commitment fee in respect of the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility to per annum in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder, subject to two step-downs based on certain specified net first lien leverage ratios. 
 Proceeds and repayments of long-term borrowings include the impact of million from the amendments described above. In addition, debt issuance costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, and financing and consent fees were not material as a result of these amendments. 
 Other than as described above, the loans under the amended and restated First Lien Credit Agreement continue to have the same terms as provided under the existing First Lien Credit Agreement, and the parties to the amended and restated First Lien Credit Agreement continue to have the same obligations set forth in the existing First Lien Credit Agreement. 
 Term Loan A Facility Redemption 
 Significant activity since December 31, 2023 is as follows: 
 May 2024 - The Company exchanged million of loans under its Term Loan A Facility for its First Lien Term Loan B due 2030, as discussed above. In addition, later that month, the Company redeemed the remaining outstanding principal balance of million of its Term Loan A Facility, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, using proceeds under the First Lien Term Loan B due 2030, as discussed above. As a result, the Term Loan A Facility has been terminated. 
 First Lien Notes due 2024 Redemption 
 Significant activity since December 31, 2023 is as follows: 
 April 2024 - The Company redeemed the remaining outstanding principal balance of million of the First Lien Notes due 2024, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, using proceeds from the Company s First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. 
 2020 Receivables Facility 
 Under the 2020 Receivables Facility, the Company obtains financing by selling or contributing certain retail installment contract receivables to the Company s wholly-owned consolidated bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity (the SPE ), which then grants a security interest in those retail installment contract receivables as collateral for cash borrowings. 
 Significant activity since December 31, 2023 is as follows: 
 March 2024 - The Company amended the agreement governing the 2020 Receivables Facility, pursuant to which the uncommitted revolving period was extended from March 2024 to April 2024.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 

 million to million and the uncommitted revolving period was extended from April 2024 to April 2025. In addition, proceeds and repayments of long-term borrowings include the impact of million from the amendments described above. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an uncommitted available borrowing capacity under the 2020 Receivables Facility of approximately million. 
 Variable Interest Entity 
 The SPE meets the definition of a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary as it has the power to direct the SPE s activities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the SPE. As such, the Company consolidates the SPE s assets, liabilities, and financial results of operations.

 INTRODUCTION 
 The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations, and financial performance based on current plans and estimates that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, which could differ materially from actual results. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q titled Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A Risk Factors. 
 To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations, the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 Our Business 
 ADT (or we, our, and us ), provides security, interactive, and smart home solutions to consumer and small business customers in the U.S. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we served approximately 6.4 million security monitoring service subscribers. 
 Our mission is to empower people to protect and connect what matters most with safe, smart, and sustainable solutions, delivered through innovative offerings, unrivaled safety, and a premium experience because we believe that everyone deserves to feel safe. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 As a result of the Commercial Divestiture and ADT Solar Exit, we currently report our results as a single operating and reportable segment, which reflects the business operations of our former CSB segment. All financial information presented in this section has been prepared in U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP, excluding any non-GAAP measures, and includes the accounts of ADT Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Results of our Solar and former Commercial businesses are presented within discontinued operations.

Business Updates 
 ADT Solar Exit 
 As discussed in Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 Divestitures, in January 2024, the Board approved a plan to fully exit the Solar Business. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, the results of operations and financial position of the Solar Business are classified as discontinued operations in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively, for all periods presented. Additionally, the cash flows and comprehensive income (loss) of the Solar Business have not been segregated and are included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), respectively. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, aggregate exit charges incurred were not material. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred aggregate exit charges of 88 million, which have been recognized within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, related to (i) 34 million, associated with the write-down and disposition of inventory and asset impairments, (ii) 29 million, associated with the disposition of the existing installation pipeline, (iii) 13 million, associated with employee separation costs, and (iv) 11 million, associated with contract termination and other charges. 
 Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid approximately 21 million in connection with the ADT Solar Exit, primarily related to employee separation and other restructuring costs. 
 We do not expect the remaining charges and cash expenditures to be material. The estimated charges and cash expenditures resulting from the ADT Solar Exit could change materially due to various factors including unknown or unforeseen costs. 
 Our reported operating metrics, gross customer revenue attrition and recurring monthly revenue (as defined and discussed below), were not impacted by the ADT Solar Exit. 
 Commercial Divestiture 
 As discussed in Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 Divestitures, we divested our Commercial Business during the fourth quarter of 2023. The Commercial Business is presented as a discontinued operation in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. Additionally, the cash flows and comprehensive income (loss) of the Commercial Business have not been segregated and are included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), respectively, for all periods presented. 
 Our reported operating metrics, gross customer revenue attrition and recurring monthly revenue (as defined and discussed below), have been recast for any period prior to the sale to exclude the Commercial Business. 
 Income received in connection with the Commercial TSA is recognized in other income (expense), and the expenses incurred by us to support the transition are recorded based on the nature of the expense. 
 
 FACTORS AFFECTING OPERATING RESULTS 
 The factors described herein could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and key performance indicators. Unless otherwise noted, our results of operations discussed below relate to continuing operations and may be impacted by the ADT Solar Exit and Commercial Divestiture. 
 Generally, a significant upfront investment is required to acquire new subscribers that in turn provide ongoing and predictable recurring revenue generated from our monitoring services and other subscriber-based offerings. Although the economics of an installation may vary depending on the customer type, acquisition channel, and product offering, we generally achieve revenue break-even in approximately two years. 
 New customer additions and customer attrition have a direct impact on our financial results, including revenue, operating income, and cash flows. A portion of our recurring customer base can be expected to cancel its service each year as customers may choose to terminate or not to renew their contracts for a variety of reasons, including relocation, cost, loss to competition, or service issues. Relocations are sensitive to changes in the residential housing market, and fewer relocations generally lead to improvements in gross customer revenue attrition, but fewer new customer additions. Additionally, non-payment disconnects generally increase in a weaker macroeconomic environment. We have been experiencing fewer relocation disconnects and higher non-pay disconnects largely related to housing market conditions and the weaker macroeconomic environment. We may 
 31 

continue to experience fluctuations in these or other trends in the future as changes in the general macroeconomic environment or housing market develop. 
 Our results are also impacted by the mix of transactions under a Company-owned equipment model versus a customer-owned equipment model (referred to as outright sales), as there are different accounting treatments applicable to each model, as well as the mix, price, and type of offerings sold. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, a growing number of our direct channel new customer adds are outright sales. As we continue to build our partnership with Google, introduce new or enhance our current offerings, and refine our go-to-market approach, we expect to continue to see a shift toward an increasing proportion of outright sales transactions, which will impact results in future periods when those changes occur. We believe ADT self set-up customers sold under an outright sales model, which typically have lower monthly recurring fees than our professional installations, will allow us to grow our subscriber base through access to the fast-growing do-it-yourself DIY market. 
 We may experience an increase in costs associated with factors such as, but not limited to, (i) offering a wider variety of products and services; (ii) providing a greater mix of interactive and smart home solutions; (iii) replacing or upgrading certain system components or technology due to technological advancements, cybersecurity upgrades, or otherwise; (iv) supply chain disruptions; (v) inflationary pressures on costs such as materials, labor, and fuel; and (vi) other changes in prices, interest rates, or terms from our suppliers, vendors, or third-party lenders. 
 As part of our response to changes or pressures in the current macroeconomic environment, we have been evaluating, and continue to evaluate, cost-saving opportunities such as leveraging technology, reducing headcount or our physical facilities footprint when appropriate, and reducing non-essential spend. While we have experienced some increase in costs as a result of inflation, we have, for the most part, been able to offset the rising costs through price increases to our customers, as well as cost-saving opportunities. 
 Hurricanes and other natural disasters may impact certain areas in which we operate and may result in service, sales, and installation disruptions to certain of our customers. At the end of September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall in the southeastern part of the U.S. We determined there were no material financial or business impacts from Hurricane Helene for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Subsequently, at the beginning of October 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida. We are currently evaluating the financial and business impacts Hurricanes Helene and Milton may have on future periods. 
 
 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
 We evaluate our results using certain key performance indicators, including operating metrics such as recurring monthly revenue and gross customer revenue attrition, as well as the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA. Computations of our key performance indicators may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 Certain operating metrics are approximated, as there may be variations to reported results due to certain adjustments we might make in connection with the integration over several periods of acquired companies that calculated these metrics differently or periodic reassessments and refinements in the ordinary course of business, including changes due to system conversions or historical methodology differences in legacy systems. 
 End-of-Period Recurring Monthly Revenue RMR 
 RMR is generated by contractual recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services provided to our customers, including contracts monitored but not owned. 
 We use RMR to evaluate our overall sales, installation, and retention performance. Additionally, we believe the presentation of RMR is useful to investors because it measures the volume of revenue under contract at a given point in time, which is useful for forecasting future revenue performance as the majority of our revenue comes from recurring sources. 
 Gross Customer Revenue Attrition 
 Gross customer revenue attrition is defined as RMR lost as a result of customer attrition, net of dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, excluding contracts monitored but not owned and self set-up/DIY customers. Customer sites are considered canceled when all services are terminated. Dealer charge-backs represent customer cancellations charged back to the dealers because the customer canceled service during the charge-back period, which is generally thirteen months. 
 Gross customer revenue attrition is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, the numerator of which is the RMR lost during the period due to attrition, net of dealer charge-backs and reinstated customers, and the denominator of which is total annualized RMR based on an average of RMR under contract at the beginning of each month during the period, in each case, excluding contracts monitored but not owned and self set-up/DIY customers. 
 32 

We use gross customer revenue attrition to evaluate our retention and customer satisfaction performance, as well as evaluate subscriber trends by vintage year. Additionally, we believe the presentation of gross customer revenue attrition is useful to investors as it provides a means to evaluate drivers of customer attrition and the impact of retention initiatives. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to income (loss) from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure), and additional information, including a description of the limitations relating to the use of Adjusted EBITDA, are provided under Non-GAAP Measures.

Revenue 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue, as compared to the prior periods, primarily reflects: 
 Monitoring and related services M S Revenue : higher recurring revenue of 21 million and 80 million, respectively, primarily driven by an increase in average prices. 
 Security installation, product, and other : (i) an increase in installation revenue of 29 million and 38 million, respectively, primarily driven by a higher volume of sales transactions with new customers under the outright sales model, as well as (ii) an increase in the amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition revenue of 11 million and 37 million, respectively, associated with customers under the Company-owned model. 
 The increase in RMR, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by an increase in average prices on new and existing subscribers as well as the impact of customer accounts purchased from a third party. 
 Gross customer revenue attrition, as compared to the prior period, remained relatively flat and included a decrease in voluntary and other disconnects offset by higher non-payment disconnects. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenue, as compared to the prior period, reflects an increase in installation and product costs of 28 million and 38 million, respectively, primarily due to a higher volume of outright sales transactions, as well as an increase in monitoring and related service costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 8 million, primarily due to higher interactive fees and other customer service initiatives. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior period, SG A remained relatively flat, and included increased investments in technology, partially offset by improved cost efficiencies. 
 The increase in SG A during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by: 
 an increase in general and administrative costs of 48 million, which includes a current year charge and prior year credit related to legal settlements in an aggregate amount of approximately 35 million, 
 an increase in the allowance for credit losses of 37 million, as a result of an increase in customer delinquencies, and 
 an increase in selling costs of 26 million, primarily related to the amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition costs. 
 Depreciation and Intangible Asset Amortization 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior period, depreciation and intangible asset amortization remained relatively flat. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior period, depreciation and intangible asset amortization reflects a decrease in the amortization of customer relationship intangible assets of 33 million, primarily related to certain assets acquired as part of the acquisition of The ADT Security Corporation in 2016, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of acquired customer contracts of 23 million. 
 Merger, Restructuring, Integration, and other 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, merger, restructuring, integration, and other decreased 8 million and 17 million, respectively, primarily due to third-party strategic optimization costs incurred during the prior period. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in interest expense, net, as compared to the prior year period, was primarily driven by: 
 34 

a decrease in net unrealized gains of 74 million on our interest rate swaps, partially offset by 
 lower interest expense of 38 million primarily related to lower principal amounts outstanding on our First Lien Term Loan B and the redemption of our Term Loan A Facility and First Lien Notes due 2024 and, 
 a non-recurring expense of 25 million recorded during the third quarter of 2023 associated with the reclassification from AOCI of historical losses related to certain interest rate swaps for which cash flows were probable of not occurring as a result of the partial redemption of our First Lien Term Loan B. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in interest expense, net, as compared to the prior year period, was primarily driven by: 
 lower interest expense of 103 million primarily related to lower principal amounts outstanding on our First Lien Term Loan B and the redemption of our Term Loan A Facility and First Lien Notes due 2024, as well as 
 a non-recurring expense of 25 million as discussed above, partially offset by 
 a decrease in net unrealized gains of 85 million on our interest rate swaps. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increases in other income (expense), as compared to the prior periods, was primarily due to income received under the Commercial TSA of 14 million and 36 million, respectively. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense was 50 million, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 27.6 . This primarily represents the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 , a state tax rate, net of federal benefits, of 6.2 , and an unfavorable impact from unrecognized tax benefits of 4.0 , partially offset by a favorable impact from a prior year tax return adjustment of 4.0 . 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense was 34 million, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 21.5 . The effective tax rate primarily represents the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 , and a state tax rate, net of federal benefits, of 5.1 , partially offset by favorable impacts from dispositions of 3.1 and prior year tax return adjustments of 1.2 . 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense was 167 million, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 28.3 . This primarily represents the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 , a state tax rate, net of federal benefits, of 5.8 , unfavorable impacts from dispositions of 1.6 , and unrecognized tax benefits of 0.8 , partially offset by a favorable impact from a prior year tax return adjustment of 1.2 . 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, income tax expense was 120 million, resulting in an effective tax rate for the period of 25.5 . The effective tax rate primarily represents the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 , a state tax rate, net of federal benefits, of 5.8 , and an unfavorable impact from permanent non-deductible items of 1.2 , partially offset by a favorable impact from dispositions of 1.0 . 
 Deferred Tax Assets 
 We have a significant amount of deferred tax assets, against which we take valuation allowances that relate to the uncertainty of our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets in future periods. We review periodically those matters that can influence our decision as to whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate. Among those matters considered are pending and enacted legislation. We will consider each quarter whether any developments to such legislation, together with the other factors we consider, require a valuation allowance. 
 We believe that our deferred tax assets for disallowed interest under Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 163(j) will continue to grow from their current level. There is currently significant uncertainty in the matters we consider when determining whether it is appropriate to take additional valuation allowances. While we have not reported any material changes to our valuation allowances since our 2023 Annual Report, we may determine to do so in subsequent periods. Any material change to our valuation allowance would materially and adversely affect our operating results and may result in a net loss position for any given period. 
 35 

Net Operating Losses 
 During 2023, we utilized a significant portion of our net operating losses NOLs to offset the gain generated from the sale of the Commercial Business. As of December 31, 2023, we disclosed that we expect to utilize our remaining NOLs during 2024. We expect to become a federal cash taxpayer in 2025 depending on future losses generated by the business, specifically with regard to the ADT Solar Exit. 
 
 NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 To provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined in accordance with GAAP, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure. This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income (loss) from continuing operations, operating income, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to measure the operational strength and performance of our business. We believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful as it provides investors additional information about our operating profitability adjusted for certain non-cash items, non-routine items we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items not core to our operations. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against other peer companies using similar measures. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for (i) interest; (ii) taxes; (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets; (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions; (v) share-based compensation expense; (vi) merger, restructuring, integration, and other items; (vii) impairment charges; and (viii) non-cash, non-routine, or other adjustments or charges not necessary to operate our business. 
 There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA as it does not include certain significant items, including interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other adjustments which directly affect our income (loss) from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure). These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently and by considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with income (loss) from continuing operations as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 The table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to income (loss) from continuing operations:

 The factors listed below exclude amounts that are outside of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Refer to the discussions above under Results of Operations for further details. 
 36 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA, as compared to the prior period, was primarily due to: 
 higher M S Revenue, net of the associated costs, of approximately 20 million, and 
 improved cost efficiencies, including the benefit of 14 million of TSA income, partially offset by increased investments in technology. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA, as compared to the prior period, was primarily due to: 
 higher M S Revenue, net of the associated costs, of approximately 81 million, and 
 higher other income of 51 million, which primarily includes 36 million of TSA income, partially offset by 
 higher selling, general, and administrative expenses, excluding commissions of 68 million, associated with negative impacts from legal settlements of 35 million, higher provision for credit losses of 37 million, and increased investments in technology, partially offset by improved cost efficiencies. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity and capital resources primarily consisted of the following: 
 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 95,338 Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 109,411 Availability under First Lien Revolving Credit Facility 575,000 Uncommitted available borrowing capacity under 2020 Receivables Facility 
 126,882 Carrying amount of total debt outstanding, including finance leases 
 7,721,086 
 Liquidity 
 We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, and the issuance of equity and/or debt securities as appropriate given market conditions. Our future cash needs are expected to include cash for operating activities including working capital, principal and interest payments on our debt, capital expenditures, potential dividend payments to our stockholders, potential share repurchases under our Share Repurchase Plan, and from time to time, strategic investments, bulk account purchases, or other initiatives that we may undertake. 
 We are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements and have both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. We may periodically seek to repay, redeem, repurchase, or refinance our indebtedness, or seek to retire or purchase our outstanding securities through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions, a 10b5-1 repurchase plan, or otherwise, and any such transactions may involve material amounts. Cash outflows for interest payments are not consistent between quarters, with larger outflows occurring in the first and third quarters, and may vary as a result of our variable rate debt. 
 We believe our cash position, available borrowing capacity under our credit agreements, and cash provided by operating activities are, and will continue to be, adequate to meet our operational and business needs in the next twelve months, as well as our long-term liquidity needs. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 There have been no significant changes to our material cash requirements, commitments and contingencies, or off-balance sheet arrangements from those disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report, except as discussed below. 
 Share Repurchase Plan 
 On January 24, 2024, our Board of Directors announced the Share Repurchase Plan (the Share Repurchase Plan ), pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase, through January 29, 2025, up to a maximum aggregate amount of 350 million of shares of our Common Stock under the Share Repurchase Plan. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 257 million remaining under the Share Repurchase Plan. 
 37 

Subsequent event - In October 2024, we repurchased 5 million shares of Common Stock at a price per share of 6.40 for an aggregate purchase price of 32 million. As a result, we have approximately 225 million remaining under the Share Repurchase Plan. 
 ADT Solar Exit 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid approximately 21 million associated with the ADT Solar Exit. We do not expect the remaining cash expenditures to be material. 
 Other Contractual Obligations 
 As discussed in Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made purchases toward our 200 million commitment under the Google Cloud Agreement Addendum of 9 million and 19 million, respectively. 
 In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, purchases toward our commitment to one of our vendors to purchase at least 320 million of security system equipment and components were approximately 44 million and 144 million, respectively. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 Significant changes and activity related to our long-term debt since our 2023 Annual Report are discussed below. Refer to Note 5 Debt for further discussion on our debt agreements and activity. 
 First Lien Credit Agreement 
 In April 2024, we amended and restated the First Lien Credit Agreement, which reduced the interest rate on our First Lien Term Loan B due 2030 from Term SOFR +2.50 to Term SOFR +2.25 . 
 In May 2024, we amended and restated the First Lien Credit Agreement, which included the exchange of 143 million principal amount of loans under our Term Loan A Facility for its First Lien Term Loan B due 2030. In addition, later that month, we further amended and restated the First Lien Credit Agreement, pursuant to which we incurred an additional 474 million of outstanding principal under the First Lien Term B Loan due 2030 and used the proceeds used to pay off the remaining outstanding balance of the Term Loan A Facility. 
 Proceeds and repayments of long-term borrowings include the impact of 646 million from the amendments described above. In addition, loss on extinguishment of debt and financing and consent fees were not material as a result of these amendments. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed 325 million and repaid 325 million under the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Subsequent event - In October 2024, we amended and restated the First Lien Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility to October 2029 (as extended, the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility ), subject to a springing maturity of 91 days prior to the maturity date of certain long-term indebtedness, and obtain an additional 225 million of Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility commitments. After giving effect to the amendment, the aggregate amount of commitments under the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility is 800 million. Borrowings under the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to either (a) Term SOFR with a floor of zero or (b) a base rate Base Rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 per annum, (ii) the rate of interest per annum last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the Prime Rate in the United States and (iii) the one-month adjusted term SOFR plus 1.00 per annum, in each case, plus an applicable margin of 2.00 per annum for Term SOFR loans and 1.00 per annum for Base Rate loans, subject to two step-downs based on certain specified net first lien leverage ratios. In addition, the amendment reduced the commitment fee in respect of the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility to 0.30 per annum in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder, subject to two step-downs based on certain specified net first lien leverage ratios. 
 Term Loan A Facility Redemption 
 In May 2024 we exchanged 143 million of loans under our Term Loan A Facility for our First Lien Term Loan B due 2030, as discussed above. In addition, later that month, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal balance of 474 million of our Term Loan A Facility, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, using proceeds under the First Lien Term Loan B due 2030, as discussed above. As a result, the Term Loan A Facility has been terminated. 
 38 

First Lien Notes due 2024 Redemption 
 In April 2024, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal balance of 100 million of our First Lien Notes due 2024, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, using proceeds from the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. 
 2020 Receivables Facility 
 In March 2024, we amended the agreement governing the 2020 Receivables Facility, pursuant to which the uncommitted revolving period was extended from March 2024 to April 2024. 
 In April 2024, we further amended the agreement governing the 2020 Receivables Facility, pursuant to which, among other things, the borrowing capacity was increased from 500 million to 550 million and the uncommitted revolving period was extended from April 2024 to April 2025. In addition, proceeds and repayments of long-term borrowings include the impact of 32 million from the amendments described above. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance was 423 million. 
 Solar Receivables Facility 
 On August 2, 2023, we entered into the Solar Receivables Facility Financing Agreement to finance receivables generated by the installation of residential solar systems, which, among other things, provides for an uncommitted revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to 300 million. During August 2024, the Solar Receivables Facility s uncommitted revolving period expired. We did not borrow any amounts under the Solar Receivables Facility prior to its expiration. 
 Debt Covenants 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenant and other maintenance tests for all our debt obligations. We do not believe there is a material risk of future noncompliance with our financial covenant and other maintenance tests. 
 Dividends 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we declared aggregate dividends of 141 million 0.055 per share per quarter) and 91 million 0.035 per share per quarter) on our Common Stock, respectively, and 9 million 0.055 per share per quarter) and 6 million 0.035 per share per quarter) on our Class B Common Stock, respectively. 
 On October 24, 2024, we announced a dividend of 0.055 per share to holders of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock of record on December 12, 2024, which will be paid on January 9, 2025. 
 
 Cash Flow Analysis 
 The amounts and discussion below include cash flows from both continuing operations and discontinued operations, as appropriate, consistent with the presentation on the Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,425,223 1,245,694 179,529 Investing activities (1,034,364) (988,081) (46,283) Financing activities (316,060) (275,129) (40,931) 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 The increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as compared to the prior period, was primarily due to a decrease in cash interest of 130 million primarily related to reduced principal balances on our debt, the benefit of lower outflows in the current year related to our Solar business, improved operating performance, and lower employee-related payments. This 
 39 

increase was partially offset by the benefit received in the prior period associated with the results of the former Commercial Business as well as legal settlements during the current and prior period. 
 The remainder of the activity related to changes in assets and liabilities due to the volume and timing of other operating cash receipts and payments with respect to when the transactions are reflected in earnings. Refer to the discussions above under Results of Operations for further details. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 The increase in net cash used in investing activities, as compared to the prior period, was primarily due to: 
 an increase in dealer generated customer accounts and bulk account purchases of 88 million primarily due to higher bulk account purchases from a third party, and 
 a 21 million payment associated with the settlement of post-closing adjustments related to the sale of the former Commercial Business, partially offset by 
 a decrease in subscriber system assets expenditures of 74 million primarily due to a higher volume of outright sales and fewer customer additions. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 The increase in net cash used in financing activities, as compared to the prior period, was primarily due to: 
 share repurchases during the current period of 93 million, and 
 an increase in net repayments on our 2020 Receivables Facility of 80 million, partially offset by 
 a decrease in net repayments on our long-term debt of 122 million primarily related to higher redemptions during the prior period. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 We disclosed our critical accounting estimates in our 2023 Annual Report, which include estimates prepared in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations. 
 Critical accounting estimates are based on, among other things, estimates, assumptions, and judgments made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Our estimates are based on relevant information available at the end of each period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or market conditions. 
 There were no material changes in our critical accounting estimates since our 2023 Annual Report.

Therefore, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Much of the information in this report that looks toward future performance is based on various factors and important assumptions about future events that may or may not actually occur. As a result, our operations and financial results in the future could differ materially and substantially from those we have discussed in the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statement made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise unless required by law. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Our operations expose us to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates as we have both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. We monitor and manage these financial exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. Our policies allow for the use of specified financial instruments for hedging purposes only. Use of derivatives for speculation purposes is prohibited. 
 There were no material changes in our interest rate risk exposure to that disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting ICFR identified in our management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our ICFR. 
 42 

During 2023, ADT began a multi-year IT transformation project by which we are migrating much of ADT s infrastructure to the cloud. The initiative includes certain aspects of our customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems. In 2024, we nationally launched our customer relationship management system for our residential pro-install customers, which resulted in changes to our processes and procedures as well as to our ICFR; however, we concluded that this launch has not currently materially affected our ICFR. In addition, the transition to our new enterprise resource planning system has recently started and is not planned to be implemented until the second half of 2025.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 See Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements under the heading Legal Proceedings included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for legal proceedings and related matters. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Our significant business risks are described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report and in our other filings with the SEC. The risk factors described in our filings with the SEC and other information may not describe every risk facing the Company. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report, except as discussed below: 
 While we are no longer a controlled company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain NYSE corporate governance requirements during a one-year transition period. 
 Our Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE ). Prior to March 19, 2024, Apollo controlled more than 50 of the combined voting power of the Company with respect to the election of directors, and we were considered a controlled company for the purposes of the NYSE rules and corporate governance standards. While we were a controlled company under the NYSE rules, we availed ourselves of applicable controlled company exemptions, which exempted us from certain requirements, including the requirements that we have a majority of independent directors on our Board of Directors and that the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors (the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee be comprised entirely of independent directors. 
 On March 19, 2024, following a registered secondary offering of the Company s Common Stock by certain Apollo affiliates (and the Company s concurrent repurchase from the underwriters of 15 million shares of Common Stock that were the subject of the offering), including the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option which closed on that date, Apollo s combined voting power with respect to the election of directors fell to 49.5 , and we ceased to be a controlled company as of that date. Under the NYSE rules, a company that ceases to be a controlled company must comply with the independent board committee requirements as they relate to the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees on the following phase-in schedule: (i) at least one independent committee member at the time the company ceases to be a controlled company (ii) at least a majority of independent committee members within 90 days of the date the company ceases to be a controlled company and (iii) all independent committee members within one year of the date the company ceases to be a controlled company. Additionally, the NYSE rules provide a 12-month phase-in period from the date a company ceases to be a controlled company to comply with the majority independent board requirement. 
 As of the date of this report, we have two independent committee members on each of the Nominating and Corporate Governance and the Compensation Committees of the Board, our Audit Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors and we are in compliance with the phase-in requirements described above. Until we are fully subject to these requirements, our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. 
 Apollo continues to exert significant influence over us, and its interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of other stockholders. 
 While we are no longer a controlled company, Apollo continues to be able to exert significant influence over us and as of September 30, 2024 had the right to, among other things, nominate 50 of our directors pursuant to the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated December 14, 2018, (the Stockholders Agreement between the Company and Ultimate Parent and the Co-Investors (as defined therein). The interests of Apollo and its affiliates, including funds affiliated with Apollo, could conflict with or differ from our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. For example, the concentration of ownership held by funds affiliated with Apollo could (i) delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of our Company, (ii) impede a merger, takeover, or other business combination which may otherwise be favorable for us or that another stockholder may otherwise view favorably or (iii) cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders. Additionally, Apollo and its affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in or provide advice to businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us, or are suppliers or customers of ours. Apollo and its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Any such investment may increase the 
 44 

potential for the conflicts of interest discussed in this risk factor. So long as funds affiliated with Apollo continue to directly or indirectly own a significant amount of our equity, even if such amount is less than 50 , Apollo and its affiliates will continue to be able to substantially influence or effectively control our ability to enter into corporate transactions. 
 In addition, we are party to the Stockholders Agreement with Ultimate Parent and the Co-Investors. The Stockholders Agreement specifies that we will not take certain significant actions without the prior consent of Ultimate Parent, including, among other things, hiring or terminating any Executive Officer of our company, designating any new Executive Officer of our company, entering into certain merger, consolidation or other change of control transactions or changing the size of our Board. The Stockholders Agreement also specifies that Ultimate Parent has the right to nominate individuals for election to our Board and that we are, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, required to nominate and recommend that each such individual be elected as a director, and the right to designate a member to each committee of our Board. Relatedly, our amended and restated Bylaws (the Bylaws provide that Ultimate Parent and the Co-Investors have the right, subject to certain conditions, to have their representatives appointed to serve on committees of our Board. 
 Cybersecurity attacks or threats or other unauthorized access or attempts to access our systems, or those of third parties, could compromise the security of our systems and otherwise disrupt our normal operations which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 We collect, process, transmit, and store sensitive and confidential information related to our customers, employees and business partners, as well as proprietary information related to our business, such as business plans and license agreements. This makes us vulnerable to cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information and technology networks and systems, including as a result of work from home environments and third-party systems that are interconnected with ours. Cyber attacks may come from phishing, malware, ransomware, or other methods. While we implement security measures within our products, services, operations, and, to a limited extent, within third parties systems, cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and increase in volume and frequency and we have not in the past been and may not in the future be able to timely detect or prevent cybersecurity breaches on our systems or within third-party systems that are interconnected with ours, including the unauthorized access, capture, or alteration of information; the exposure or exploitation of potential security vulnerabilities; distributed denial of service attacks; the installation of malware or ransomware; acts of vandalism; computer viruses; or misplaced data or data loss that could materially adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition. Despite our security measures, we and third parties whose systems are interconnected with ours have been the target of and/or subject to a number of these forms of cyber attacks, including the incidents disclosed in the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 8, 2024 and October 7, 2024, respectively, the latter of which (referred to herein as the October Incident we are still actively investigating, and we will likely continue to be the target of and/or subject to such attacks in the future. These cyber attacks have in the past resulted and may in the future result in certain impacts on our Company, including disrupted operations, system instability, theft of our confidential or proprietary or other information, increased cybersecurity protection, consulting and legal costs, litigation, and reputational damage. In addition, cyber attacks could result in misstated or misappropriated financial data or impair our ability to effectively manage our financial reporting process. We may be subject to regulatory scrutiny or exposed to additional litigation or other claims by affected persons including our customers, employees, and business partners. We are aware of one putative class action that was filed by a former ADT employee on October 18, 2024, alleging negligence and breach of implied contract arising out of the October Incident. Additionally, while our investigation is continuing, we have notified one state regulator about the October Incident and may additionally need to notify regulatory agencies in other states and individuals. While we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. 
 In addition, following the Commercial Divestiture, certain of our information systems and our information security protocols remain interdependent on those of our divested Commercial Business, including dependence for a transitional period on its information systems for billing and alarm monitoring for a small portion of our clients accounts. Moreover, certain employees of our former Commercial Business have had and will continue to have access to our financial and other internal systems for a period of time. For more information on the continuing services relationship between ADT and our former Commercial Business, see the risk factor included in our 2023 Annual Report entitled, We may not achieve some or all of the strategic and financial benefits that we expect to achieve from the Commercial Divestiture or the Solar Exit which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations . 
 This interconnection with our former Commercial Business was exploited by an unauthorized actor in the October Incident and exposes us to increased risks related to cyber attacks. Cyber attacks and threats at our former Commercial Business have in the past led and may in the future lead to cyber attacks and threats to our systems and assets. Any measures we have taken or may take in the future to protect against theft and unauthorized system access may prove insufficient and cannot provide absolute protection against employees, including employees of our former Commercial Business, who may wrongfully or negligently use or access such technology, intellectual property, or information, or negligently or wrongfully disclose such technology and intellectual, confidential, proprietary, or any other information to third parties, including our competitors. 
 45 

O ur business also requires us to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Third parties, including our partners and vendors, could also be a source of cybersecurity risk to us, or cause disruptions to our normal operations, in the event of a failure of their own products, components, networks, cybersecurity systems, and infrastructure. For example, in 2021, one of our vendors, the Ultimate Kronos Group Kronos ), which is a workforce management and human capital management cloud provider, experienced a ransomware attack that resulted in Kronos temporarily decommissioning the functionality of certain of its cloud software, requiring us to find alternative methods to properly pay our employees and to monitor the status of the work in progress of certain of our projects in a timely manner. In addition, some of the products we sell and provide services for are categorized as Internet of Things and may become targets for cybercriminals and other actors attempting to gain unauthorized access. The significant increase in the number of our employees working from home further exposes us to security risks. Although we take steps to secure confidential, proprietary or other information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on our behalf, we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services. 
 A significant actual or perceived (whether or not valid) theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, employee, or other personally identifiable data, whether by us, our partners and vendors, or other third parties, or as a result of employee error or malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with applicable industry standards or our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data, or a violation of our privacy and information security policies with respect to such data, could result in significant remediation costs, administrative fines, litigation or other claims by third parties, or regulatory actions against us. Such an event could additionally result in unfavorable publicity and therefore materially and adversely affect the market s perception of the security and reliability of our products and services and our credibility and reputation with our customers, which may lead to customer dissatisfaction and could result in lost sales and increased customer revenue attrition. 
 In addition, we depend on our information technology infrastructure, and that of our third parties, for business-to-business and business-to-consumer electronic commerce. Cyber attacks to, or threats against, this infrastructure could create prolonged system disruptions and shutdowns that could negatively impact our operations. Increasingly, our products and services are accessed through the Internet, and a significant number of service calls happen virtually, and cyber attacks and/or threats in connection with the delivery of our services via the Internet may affect us and could be detrimental to our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. There can be no assurance that our continued investments in new and emerging technology and other solutions to protect our network and information systems will prevent any of the risks described herein. In addition, any delay in making such investments due to conflicting budget priorities or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. There can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient to protect against all our losses from any future disruptions or cyber attacks on our systems or other events as described herein.

 (1) On January 24, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors announced the Share Repurchase Plan, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase, through January 29, 2025, up to a maximum aggregate amount of 350 million of shares of the Company's Common Stock. The Company may effect these repurchases pursuant to one or more open market or private transactions, including pursuant to a plan that qualifies for the affirmative defense provided by Rule 10b5 1 under the Exchange Act, or pursuant to one or more accelerated share repurchase agreements. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any of its shares of Common Stock, and the timing and amount of any repurchases will depend on legal requirements, market conditions, stock price, the availability of the safe harbor provided by Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, alternative uses of capital, and other factors. 
 
 Subsequent event - In October 2024, the Company repurchased 5 million shares of Common Stock at a price per share of 6.40 for an aggregate purchase price of 32 million. As a result, the Company has approximately 225 million remaining under the Share Repurchase Plan.

Subject to Article 8, to the fullest extent not prohibited by (and not merely to the 8 extent affirmatively permitted by) applicable law, Indemnitee shall be indemnified, held harmless and exonerated against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. No indemnification for Expenses shall be made under this Article 3 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been finally adjudged (and not subject to further appeal) by a court of competent jurisdiction to be liable to the Company, except to the extent that the Delaware Court or any court in which the Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification. ARTICLE 4 INDEMNIFICATION FOR EXPENSES OF A PARTY WHO IS WHOLLY OR PARTLY SUCCESSFUL Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, in whole or in part, the Company shall indemnify, hold harmless and exonerate Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, if Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, then the Company shall indemnify, hold harmless and exonerate Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection with each resolved claim, issue or matter, whether or not Indemnitee was wholly or partly successful; provided that Indemnitee shall only be entitled to indemnification for Expenses with respect to unsuccessful claims under this Article 4 to the extent Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, in the case of a criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was unlawful.

No indemnity shall be available under this Article 6 on account of Indemnitee s conduct that constitutes a breach of Indemnitee s duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders or is an act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law. ARTICLE 7 CONTRIBUTION IN THE EVENT OF JOINT LIABILITY 7.1. To the fullest extent not prohibited by (and not merely to the extent affirmatively permitted by) law, if the indemnification rights provided for in this Agreement are unavailable to Indemnitee in whole or in part for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall pay, in the first instance, the entire amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, liabilities, fines, penalties, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any Proceeding without requiring Indemnitee to contribute to such payment, and the Company hereby waives and relinquishes any right of contribution it may have at any time against Indemnitee. 7.2. The Company shall not enter into any settlement of any Proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding) unless such settlement provides for a full and final release of all claims asserted against Indemnitee. 7.3. The Company hereby agrees to fully indemnify, hold harmless and exonerate Indemnitee from any claims for contribution which may be brought by officers, directors or employees of the Company (other than Indemnitee) who may be jointly liable with Indemnitee. 10 ARTICLE 8 EXCLUSIONS 8.1. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnity, contribution or advancement of Expenses in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee: (a) except as provided in Section 15.4, for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of Indemnitee under any insurance policy of the Company or its Subsidiaries or other indemnity provision of the Company or its Subsidiaries, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount actually received under any insurance policy, contract, agreement, other indemnity provision or otherwise; or (b) for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act (or any similar successor statute) or similar provisions of state statutory law or common law; or (c) in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated or brought voluntarily by Indemnitee, including, without limitation, any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors, officers, managers, managing members, employees or other indemnitees, other than a Proceeding initiated by Indemnitee to enforce its rights under this Agreement, unless (i) the Board authorized the Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) or (ii) the Company provides the indemnification payment, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation; or (d) for the payment of amounts required to be reimbursed to the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or any similar successor statute; or (e) for any payment to Indemnitee that is determined to be unlawful by a final judgment or other adjudication of a court or arbitration, arbitral or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as to which there is no further right or option of appeal or the time within which an appeal must be filed has expired without such filing and under the procedures and subject to the presumptions of this Agreement; or (f) in connection with any Proceeding initiated by Indemnitee to enforce its rights under this Agreement if a court or arbitration, arbitral or administrative body of competent jurisdiction determines by final judicial decision that each of the material assertions made by Indemnitee in such Proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous. 8.2. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be permitted, to make any indemnity, contribution or advancement in respect of any amount that the Company or any of its affiliates is obligated to 

11 recover under the Company s Incentive Compensation Clawback Policy or any similar or successor policy in order to comply with the requirements of Section 303A.14 of the New York Stock Exchange Listing Company Manual or any similar requirements of any exchange on which any securities of the Company or any of its affiliates is then listed (the Dodd-Frank Clawback Requirements ). The exclusions in this Article 8 shall not apply to counterclaims or affirmative defenses asserted by Indemnitee in an action brought against Indemnitee. ARTICLE 9 ADVANCES OF EXPENSES; SELECTION OF LAW FIRM 9.1. Subject to Article 8, the Company shall, unless prohibited by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, advance the Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding within ten business days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advances, together with a reasonably detailed written explanation of the basis therefor and an itemization of legal fees and disbursements in reasonable detail, from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding. Advances shall be unsecured and interest free. Indemnitee shall qualify for advances, to the fullest extent permitted by this Agreement, solely upon the execution and delivery to the Company of an undertaking providing that Indemnitee undertakes to repay the advance to the extent that it is ultimately determined, by final judicial decision of a court or arbitration, arbitral or administrative body of competent jurisdiction from which there is no further right to appeal, that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company under the provisions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Incorporation or pursuant to applicable law. This Section 9.1 shall not apply to any claim made by Indemnitee for which an indemnification payment is excluded pursuant to Article 8. 9.2. If the Company shall be obligated under Section 9.1 hereof to pay the Expenses of any Proceeding against Indemnitee, then the Company shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Proceeding upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written notice of its election to do so. If the Company elects to assume the defense of such Proceeding, then unless the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such Proceeding include one or more Persons holding, together with his, her or its Affiliates, in the aggregate, a majority of the combined voting power of the Company s then outstanding Voting Securities, the Company shall assume such defense using a single law firm (in addition to local counsel) selected by the Company representing Indemnitee and other present and former directors or officers of the Company. The retention of such law firm by the Company shall be subject to prior written approval by Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If the Company elects to assume the defense of such Proceeding and the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such Proceeding include one or more Persons holding, together with his, her or its Affiliates, in the aggregate, a majority of the combined voting power of the Company s then outstanding Voting Securities, then the Company shall assume such 12 defense using a single law firm (in addition to local counsel) selected by Indemnitee and any other present or former directors or officers of the Company who are parties to such Proceeding. After (x) in the case of retention of any such law firm selected by the Company, delivery of the required notice to Indemnitee, approval of such law firm by Indemnitee and the retention of such law firm by the Company, or (y) in the case of retention of any such law firm selected by Indemnitee, the completion of such retention, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any Expenses of any other law firm incurred by Indemnitee after the date that such first law firm is retained by the Company with respect to the same Proceeding; provided, that in the case of retention of any such law firm selected by the Company (a) Indemnitee shall have the right to retain a separate law firm in any such Proceeding at Indemnitee s sole expense; and (b) if (i) the retention of a law firm by Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that (1) there may be a conflict of interest between either (x) the Company and Indemnitee or (y) Indemnitee and another present or former director or officer of the Company also represented by such law firm in the conduct of any such defense, or (2) there may be defenses available to Indemnitee that are incompatible or inconsistent with those available to the Company or another present or former director represented by such law firm in the conduct of such defense, or (iii) the Company shall not, in fact, have retained a law firm to prosecute the defense of such Proceeding within thirty days, then the reasonable Expenses of a single law firm retained by Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Company. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Section 9.2, the Company will not be entitled without the written consent of the Indemnitee to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company. ARTICLE 10 PROCEDURE FOR NOTIFICATION; DEFENSE OF CLAIM; SETTLEMENT 10.1. Indemnitee shall, as a condition precedent to Indemnitee s right to be indemnified under this Agreement, give the Company notice in writing promptly of any claim made against Indemnitee for which indemnification will or could be sought under this Agreement; provided, however, that a delay in giving such notice shall not deprive Indemnitee of any right to be indemnified under this Agreement unless, and then only to the extent that, such delay is materially prejudicial to the defense of such claim. The omission or delay to notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability for indemnification which it may have to Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification. 10.2. The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own expense. 13 10.3. The Company shall have no obligation to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any claim effected without the Company s prior written consent, provided the Company has not breached its obligations hereunder. The Company shall not settle any claim, including, without limitation, any claim in which it takes the position that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification in connection with such settlement, nor shall the Company settle any claim which would impose any fine or obligation on Indemnitee or attribute to Indemnitee any admission of liability, without Indemnitee s prior written consent. Neither the Company nor Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold, delay or condition their consent to any proposed settlement. ARTICLE 11 PROCEDURE UPON APPLICATION FOR INDEMNIFICATION 11.1. Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of Section 10.1, a determination, if required by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case by one of the following methods: (a) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee, or (b) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, (i) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (provided there is a minimum of three Disinterested Directors), even though less than a quorum of the Board, (ii) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (provided there is a minimum of three Disinterested Directors), even though less than a quorum of the Board, (iii) if there are less than three Disinterested Directors or, if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (iv) if so directed by the Board, by a majority of the Company s stockholders. If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten business days after such determination and any future amounts due to Indemnitee shall be paid in accordance with this Agreement. Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Persons making such determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification, including, without limitation, providing to such Persons upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination, provided, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Indemnitee to waive any privilege Indemnitee may have. Any costs or Expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable and documented attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the Persons making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification), and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom. 14 11.2. If the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 11.1 hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 11.2. If a Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising Indemnitee of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within thirty days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of Independent Counsel as defined in Article 1 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitration, arbitral or administrative body has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within thirty days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may seek arbitration for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other s selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the arbitrator or by such other person as the arbitrator shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 11.1 hereof. Such arbitration referred to in the previous sentence shall be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and Article 13 hereof shall apply in respect of such arbitration and the Company and Indemnitee. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 13.1 of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing). ARTICLE 12 PRESUMPTIONS AND EFFECT OF CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS 12.1. In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the Person making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 10.1 of this 

15 Agreement. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence. Neither the failure of the Company (including by its Board, its Independent Counsel and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification or advancement of Expenses is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its Board, its Independent Counsel and its stockholders) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 12.2. If the Person empowered or selected under Article 11 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within sixty days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (a) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (b) a final judicial determination that any or all such indemnification is expressly prohibited under applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that such sixty-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty days, if the Person making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto, provided further that, if final selection of Independent Counsel has not occurred within thirty days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, such sixty-day period may be after the final selection of Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 11.2. 12.3. The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement (with or without court approval), conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee s conduct was unlawful. 12.4. For purposes of any determination of good faith pursuant to this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if, among other things, Indemnitee s action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the directors or officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise, its board of directors, any committee of the board of directors or any director, or on information or records given or reports 16 made to the Enterprise, its board of directors, any committee of the board of directors or any director, by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Enterprise, its board of directors, any committee of the board of directors or any director. The provisions of this Section 12.4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which Indemnitee may be deemed or found to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement. In any event, it shall be presumed that Indemnitee has at all times acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence. 12.5. The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement. 12.6. The Company acknowledges that a settlement or other disposition short of final judgment may be successful if it permits a party to avoid expense, delay, distraction, disruption and uncertainty. In the event that any action, claim or proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party is resolved in any manner other than by adverse judgment against Indemnitee (including, without limitation, settlement of such action, claim or proceeding with or without payment of money or other consideration) it shall be presumed that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in such action, suit or proceeding. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence. ARTICLE 13 REMEDIES OF INDEMNITEE 13.1. In the event that (a) a determination is made pursuant to Article 11 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (b) advancement of Expenses, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, is not timely made pursuant to Article 9 of this Agreement, (c) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 11.1 of this Agreement within thirty days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification and of reasonable documentation and information which Indemnitee may be called upon to provide pursuant to Section 11.1, (d) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Articles 4, 5, 6 or the last sentence of Section 11.1 of this Agreement within ten business days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, (e) a contribution payment is not made in a timely manner pursuant to Article 7 of this Agreement, (f) payment of indemnification pursuant to Article 3 or 6 of this Agreement is not made within thirty days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or (g) the Company or any representative thereof takes or threatens 17 to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or Proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, Indemnitee the benefits provided or intended to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction of Indemnitee s entitlement to such indemnification, contribution or advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his or her option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Except as set forth herein, the provisions of Delaware law (without regard to its conflict of laws rules) shall apply to any such arbitration. The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee s right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration. The award rendered by such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties hereto, and final judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 13.2. In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 11.1 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Article 13 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Article 13, Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to receive advances of Expenses under this Agreement and the Company shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be, and the Company may not refer to or introduce into evidence any determination pursuant to Section 11.1 of this Agreement adverse to Indemnitee for any purpose. If Indemnitee commences a judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to this Article 13, Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any advances pursuant to Article 9 until a final determination is made with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification (as to which all rights of appeal shall have been exhausted or lapsed). 13.3. If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 11.1 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Article 13, absent (a) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification or (b) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law or the Dodd-Frank Clawback Requirements or the Certificate of Incorporation. 13.4. The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Article 13 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. 18 13.5. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law against all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within ten business days after the Company s receipt of such written request) pay to Indemnitee, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, or the Certificate of Incorporation, such Expenses which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any judicial proceeding or arbitration brought by Indemnitee (a) to enforce Indemnitee s rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement or any other indemnification, advancement or contribution agreement or provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, or the By-Laws now or hereafter in effect; or (b) for recovery or advances under any insurance policy maintained by any person for the benefit of Indemnitee, regardless of the outcome and whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advancement of Expenses, contribution or insurance recovery, as the case may be (unless such judicial proceeding or arbitration was not brought by Indemnitee in good faith). 13.6. Interest shall be paid by the Company to Indemnitee at the legal rate under Delaware law for amounts which the Company indemnifies, or is obliged to indemnify, for the period commencing with the date on which Indemnitee requests indemnification, contribution, reimbursement or advancement of any Expenses and ending with the date on which such payment is made to Indemnitee by the Company. ARTICLE 14 SECURITY Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent requested by Indemnitee and approved by the Board, the Company may, as permitted by applicable securities laws, at any time and from time to time provide security to Indemnitee for the Company s obligations hereunder through an irrevocable bank line of credit, funded trust or other collateral. Any such security, once provided to Indemnitee, may not be revoked or released without the prior written consent of Indemnitee. ARTICLE 15 NON-EXCLUSIVITY; SURVIVAL OF RIGHTS; INSURANCE; PRIMACY OF INDEMNIFICATION; SUBROGATION 15.1. The rights of Indemnitee as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors of the Company, or otherwise. To the extent that a change in applicable law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws or this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by 

19 this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy. 15.2. The DGCL and the Certificate of Incorporation permit the Company to purchase and maintain insurance or furnish similar protection or make other arrangements, including, but not limited to, providing a trust fund, letter of credit or surety bond Indemnification Arrangements on behalf of Indemnitee against any liability asserted against Indemnitee or incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee or in such capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or arising out of Indemnitee s status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify Indemnitee against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement or under the DGCL, as it may then be in effect. The purchase, establishment and maintenance of any such Indemnification Arrangement shall not in any way limit or affect the rights and obligations of the Company or of Indemnitee under this Agreement except as expressly provided herein, and the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and Indemnitee shall not in any way limit or affect the rights and obligations of the Company or the other party or parties thereto under any such Indemnification Arrangement. 15.3. To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, trustees, partners, managers, managing members, fiduciaries, employees or agents of the Company or of any other Enterprise which such person serves at the request of the Company, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such director, officer, trustee, partner, manager, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent under such policy or policies. If, at the time the Company receives notice from any source of a Proceeding as to which Indemnitee is a party or a participant (as a witness or otherwise), the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect which may cover such Proceeding, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies and Indemnitee shall promptly cooperate with any request by the Company or insurers in connection with such action. 15.4. The Company hereby acknowledges that Indemnitee has, or may have from time to time, certain rights to indemnification, advancement of Expenses and/or insurance provided by the Indemnitee-Related Entities. The Company hereby agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to Indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Indemnitee-Related Entities to advance Expenses or to provide indemnification for the same Expenses or liabilities 20 incurred by Indemnitee are secondary), (ii) that it shall be required to advance the full amount of Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent not prohibited by (and not merely to the extent affirmatively permitted by) applicable law and as required by the terms of this Agreement and the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws (or any other agreement between the Company and Indemnitee), without regard to any rights Indemnitee may have against the Indemnitee-Related Entities and (iii) that, with respect to the Company s obligations to advance Expenses and indemnify Indemnitee by reason of Indemnitee s service to the Company, it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Indemnitee- Related Entities from any and all claims against the Indemnitee-Related Entities for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The Company further agrees that no advancement or payment by the Indemnitee-Related Entities on behalf of Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Company shall reduce or otherwise alter the rights of Indemnitee or the obligations of the Company hereunder. Under no circumstance shall the Company be entitled to any right of subrogation or contribution by the Indemnitee-Related Entities. In the event that any of the Indemnitee-Related Entities shall make any advancement or payment on behalf of Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Company, the Indemnitee-Related Entity making such payment shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee against the Company, and Indemnitee shall execute all papers reasonably required and take all action reasonably necessary to secure such rights, including, without limitation, execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Indemnitee-Related Entities to bring suit to enforce such rights. The Company and Indemnitee agree that the Indemnitee-Related Entities are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this Section 15.4, entitled to enforce this Section 15.4 as though each of the Indemnitee-Related Entities were a party to this Agreement. 15.5. Except as provided in Section 15.4, in the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee (other than against the Indemnitee-Related Entities), who shall execute all papers reasonably required and take all action reasonably necessary to secure such rights, including, without limitation, execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights. 15.6. Except as provided in Section 15.4, the Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder (or for which advancement is provided hereunder) if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise. 15.7. Except as provided in Section 15.4, the Company s obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at 21 the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other Enterprise shall be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification payments or advancement of Expenses from such Enterprise. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (a) Indemnitee shall have no obligation to reduce, offset, allocate, pursue or apportion any indemnification advancement, contribution or insurance coverage among multiple parties possessing such duties to Indemnitee prior to the Company s satisfaction and performance of all its obligations under this Agreement, and (b) the Company shall perform fully its obligations under this Agreement without regard to whether Indemnitee holds, may pursue or has pursued any indemnification, advancement, contribution or insurance coverage rights against any person or entity other than the Company. ARTICLE 16 ENFORCEMENT AND BINDING EFFECT 16.1. The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered into this Agreement and assumes the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to induce Indemnitee to serve or continue to serve as a director, officer or key employee of the Company, and the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in serving or continuing to serve as a director, officer or key employee of the Company. 16.2. This Agreement shall be effective as of the date set forth on the first page and may apply to acts or omissions of Indemnitee which occurred prior to such date if Indemnitee was an officer, director, employee or other agent of the Company, or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, at the time such act or omission occurred. 16.3. The Company and Indemnitee agree herein that a monetary remedy for breach of this Agreement, at some later date, may be inadequate, impracticable and difficult to prove, and further agree that such breach may cause Indemnitee irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that Indemnitee may enforce this Agreement by seeking, among other things, injunctive relief and/or specific performance hereof, without any necessity of showing actual damage or irreparable harm and that by seeking injunctive relief and/or specific performance, Indemnitee shall not be precluded from seeking or obtaining any other relief to which Indemnitee may be entitled. The Company and Indemnitee further agree that Indemnitee shall be entitled to such specific performance and injunctive relief, including, without limitation, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, without the necessity of posting bonds or other undertaking in connection therewith. The Company acknowledges that in the absence of a waiver, a bond or undertaking may be required of Indemnitee by the 22 Court, and the Company hereby waives any such requirement of such a bond or undertaking. ARTICLE 17 MISCELLANEOUS 17.1. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and Indemnitee s assigns, heirs, executors and administrators. The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. 17.2. Section 409A. It is intended that any indemnification payment or advancement of Expenses made hereunder shall be exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the guidance issued thereunder Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A- 1(b)(10). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any indemnification payment or advancement of Expenses made hereunder shall be determined to be nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, then (i) the amount of the indemnification payment or advancement of Expenses during one taxable year shall not affect the amount of the indemnification payments or advancement of Expenses during any other taxable year, (ii) the indemnification payments or advancement of Expenses must be made on or before the last day of the Indemnitee s taxable year following the year in which the expense was incurred and (iii) the right to indemnification payments or advancement of Expenses hereunder is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 17.3. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court to require the Company to do or to fail to do an act which is in violation of applicable law, such provision (including, without limitation, any provision within a single Article, Section, paragraph or sentence) shall be limited or modified in its application to the minimum extent necessary to avoid a violation of law, and, as so limited or modified, such provision and the balance of this Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with their terms to the fullest extent permitted by law. 17.4. Entire Agreement. Without limiting any of the rights of Indemnitee under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

23 17.5. Modification, Waiver and Termination. No supplement, modification, termination, cancellation or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by each of the parties hereto. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in Indemnitee s Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. 17.6. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) if delivered by hand and receipted for by the party to whom said notice or other communication shall have been directed or (b) mailed by certified or registered mail with postage prepaid on the third business day after the date on which it is so mailed: (i) If to Indemnitee, at the address indicated on the signature page of this Agreement, or such other address as Indemnitee shall provide in writing to the Company. (ii) If to the Company, to: ADT Inc. 1501 Yamato Road Boca Raton, FL 33431 Attn: Chief Legal Officer Telephone: (561) 988-3600 or to any other address as may have been furnished to Indemnitee in writing by the Company. 17.7. Applicable Law. This Agreement and the legal relations among the parties shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, a court of competent jurisdiction shall make a final determination that the provisions of the law of any state other than Delaware govern indemnification by the Company of Indemnitee, then the indemnification provided under this Agreement shall in all instances be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted under such law, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary. 17.8. Identical Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including by electronic delivery of a counterpart in pdf format), each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. Only one such counterpart signed by the party against whom enforceability is sought needs to be produced to evidence the existence of this Agreement. 24 17.9. Headings. The headings of the paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part of this Agreement or to affect the construction thereof. 17.10. Representation by Counsel. Each of the parties has been represented by and has had an opportunity to consult legal counsel in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed against or interpreted to the disadvantage of any party by any court or arbitrator or any governmental authority by reason of such party having drafted or being deemed to have drafted such provision. 17.11. Period of Limitations. No legal action shall be brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by or in the right of the Company, the Indemnitee, or Indemnitee s spouse, heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives against the Company, Indemnitee, or Indemnitee s spouse, heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives after the expiration of two years from the date of accrual of such cause of action, and any claim or cause of action of the Company, the Indemnitee, or Indemnitee s spouse, heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives, shall be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted by the timely filing of a legal action within such two-year period; provided, however, that if any shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable to any such cause of action, such shorter period shall govern. 17.12. Additional Acts. If for the validation of any of the provisions in this Agreement any act, resolution, approval or other procedure is required, the Company undertakes to cause such act, resolution, approval or other procedure to be affected or adopted in a manner that will enable the Company to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement. [Signature page follows] [Signature page to Indemnification Agreement] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be signed as of the day and year first above written.
