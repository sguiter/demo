As of September 30, 2024, the million of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were concentrated in the Company s corporate securities within the finance, consumer non-cyclical and utility sectors. As of December 31, 2023, the million of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were concentrated in the Company's corporate securities within the finance, consumer non-cyclical and utility sectors. 
 
 In accordance with its policy described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that an adjustment to earnings for credit losses related to these fixed maturity securities was not warranted at September 30, 2024. This conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the underlying credit and cash flows for each security. Gross unrealized losses are primarily attributable to increases in interest rates, general credit spread widening and foreign currency exchange rate movements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not intend to sell these securities, and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis.

 The changes in fair value of cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and are included in "Net unrealized investment gains (losses)" in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss); these amounts are then reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Using September 30, 2024 values, it is estimated that a pre-tax gain of million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI to earnings during the subsequent twelve months ending September 30, 2025. 
 
 The exposures the Company is hedging with these qualifying cash flow hedges include the variability of the payment or receipt of interest or foreign currency amounts on existing financial instruments. 
 
 There were no material amounts reclassified from AOCI into earnings relating to instances in which the Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the forecasted transaction did not occur by the anticipated date or within the additional time period permitted by the authoritative guidance for the accounting for derivatives and hedging.

 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 
 The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial derivative transactions with a positive fair value. The Company manages credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with regulated derivatives exchanges for exchange traded derivatives and its affiliate, Prudential Global Funding LLC PGF ), related to its over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives. PGF, in turn, manages its credit risk by: (i) entering into derivative transactions with highly rated major international financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties governed by master netting agreements, as applicable; (ii) trading through central clearing and OTC parties; (iii) obtaining collateral, such as cash and securities, when appropriate; and (iv) setting limits on single-party credit exposures which are subject to periodic management review. 
 
 Substantially all of the Company s derivative agreements have zero thresholds which require daily full collateralization by the party in a liability position.

 (1) Conversely, the impact of a decrease in input would have the opposite impact on fair value as that presented in the table.

 (3) Includes assets classified as fixed maturities, available-for-sale. 
 (4) Represents multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and are amounts used when the Company has determined that market participants would use such multiples when valuing the investments. 
 (5) Market risk benefits primarily represent fair value for all living benefit guarantees including accumulation, withdrawal and income benefits. Since the valuation methodology for these assets and liabilities uses a range of inputs that vary at the contract level over the cash flow projection period, presenting a range, rather than weighted average, is a more meaningful representation of the unobservable inputs used in the valuation. 
 (6) Lapse rates for contracts with living benefit guarantees are adjusted at the contract level based on the in-the-moneyness of the living benefit and reflect other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. Lapse rates are reduced when contracts are more in-the-money. Lapse rates for contracts with index-linked crediting guarantees may be adjusted at the contract level based on the applicability of any surrender charges, product type, and market related factors such as interest rates. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply. For any given contract, lapse rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for the purposes of valuing these balances.

billion of account values of Prudential Defined Income ("PDI") traditional variable annuity contracts with guaranteed living and death benefits. See Note 11 for additional information regarding this transaction. As a result of this transaction, a ceded MRB asset balance was established to fair value the reinsurance reimbursements to the Company. The establishment of the fair value also required an estimate of NPR for AuguStar, which may differ from the Company's; however, the NPR spreads for AuguStar were developed using a methodology similar to that of the Company. 
 (8) The utilization rate assumption estimates the percentage of contracts that will utilize the benefit during the contract duration and begin lifetime withdrawals at various time intervals from contract inception. The remaining contractholders are assumed to either begin lifetime withdrawals immediately or never utilize the benefit. Utilization assumptions may vary by product type, tax status and age. The impact of changes in these assumptions is highly dependent on the product type, the age of the contractholder at the time of the sale, and the timing of the first lifetime income withdrawal. Range reflects the utilization rate for the vast majority of business with living benefits. 
 (9) The withdrawal rate assumption estimates the magnitude of annual contractholder withdrawals relative to the maximum allowable amount under the contract. These assumptions vary based on the age of the contractholder, the tax status of the contract and the duration since the contractholder began lifetime withdrawals. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the minimum withdrawal rate assumption is and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the maximum withdrawal rate assumption may be greater than . The fair value of the liability will generally increase the closer the withdrawal rate is to and decrease as the withdrawal rate moves further away from . 
 (10) The range reflects the mortality rates for the vast majority of business with living benefits and other contracts, with policyholders ranging from to years old. While the majority of living benefits have a minimum age requirement, certain other contracts do not have an age restriction. This results in contractholders with mortality rates approaching for certain benefits. Mortality rates may vary by product, age, and duration. A mortality improvement assumption is also incorporated into the overall mortality table. 
 (11) Includes deposit assets related to reinsurance agreements using deposit method of accounting, which include amounts representing the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the index-linked features of certain annuity products. 
 (12) Policyholders account balances primarily represent general account liabilities for the index-linked interest credited on certain of the Company s life and annuity products that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. Since the valuation methodology for these liabilities uses a range of inputs that vary at the contract level over the cash flow projection period, presenting a range, rather than a weighted average, is a more meaningful representation of the unobservable inputs used in the valuation. 
 (13) Option budget estimates the expected long-term cost of options used to hedge exposures associated with equity price and interest rate changes. The level of option budget determines future costs of the options, which impacts the growth in account value and the valuation of embedded derivatives. 
 
 Interrelationships Between Unobservable Inputs In addition to the sensitivities of fair value measurements to changes in each unobservable input in isolation, as reflected in the table above, interrelationships between these inputs may also exist, such that a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another or multiple inputs. Examples of such interrelationships for significant internally-priced Level 3 assets and liabilities are as follows: 
 
 Corporate Securities The rate used to discount future cash flows reflects current risk-free rates plus credit and liquidity spread requirements that market participants would use to value an asset. The discount rate may be influenced by many factors, including market cycles, expectations of default, collateral, term, and asset complexity. Each of these factors can influence discount rates, either in isolation, or in response to other factors. During weaker economic cycles, as the expectations of default increase, credit spreads widen, which results in a decrease in fair value. 
 
 Commercial Mortgage-backed Securities Interrelationships may exist between the prepayment rate, the default rate and/or loss severity, depending on specific market conditions. In stronger economic cycles, prepayment rates are generally driven by underlying property appreciation and subsequent cash-out refinances, while default rates and loss severity may be lower. During weaker economic cycles, prepayment rates may decline, while default rates and loss severity increase. Generally, a change in the assumption used for the probability of default would be accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for prepayment rates. The impact of these factors on average life and economics varies with the deal structure and tranche subordination. 
 
 Market Risk Benefits The Company expects efficient benefit utilization and withdrawal rates to generally be correlated with lapse rates. However, behavior is generally highly dependent on the facts and circumstances surrounding the individual contractholder, such as their liquidity needs or tax situation, which could drive lapse behavior independent of other contractholder behavior assumptions. To the extent more efficient contractholder behavior results in greater in-the-moneyness at the contract level, lapse rates may decline for those contracts. Similarly, to the extent that increases in equity volatility are correlated with overall declines in the capital markets, lapse rates may decline as contracts become more in-the-money.

 In both 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized an unfavorable impact to net income attributable to the actuarial assumption update for direct and assumed MRBs, primarily due to updates to policyholder behavior assumptions on certain variable annuities. 
 
 The Company issues certain variable annuity insurance contracts where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a return of no less than (1) total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return, and/or (2) the highest anniversary contract value on a specified date adjusted for any withdrawals. These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death, annuitization or at specified dates during the accumulation period and withdrawal and income benefits payable during specified periods. 
 
 The Company also issues indexed variable annuity contracts for which the return is tied to the return of specific indices where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a return of no less than total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals upon death. In certain of these indexed variable annuity contracts, the Company also contractually guarantees to the contractholder withdrawal benefits payable during specific periods. 
 
 For guarantees of benefits that are payable in the event of death, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the current guaranteed minimum death benefit in excess of the current account balance at the balance sheet date. The Company s primary risk exposures for these contracts relates to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including fixed income and equity market returns, contract lapses and contractholder mortality. 
 
 For guarantees of benefits that are payable at annuitization, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuity payments available to the contractholder determined in accordance with the terms of the contract in excess of the current account balance. The Company s primary risk exposures for these contracts relates to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including fixed income and equity market returns, timing of annuitization, contract lapses and contractholder mortality.

million pre-tax recapture loss and a million DRG that will be amortized into income over the estimated remaining life of the reinsured policies. 
 
 Reserves related to reinsured long-duration contracts are accounted for using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying contracts. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers for long-duration reinsurance arrangements are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liabilities and policy benefits associated with the reinsured policies. Reinsurance policy charges and fee income ceded for universal life and variable annuity products are accounted for as a reduction of policy charges and fee income. Reinsurance premiums ceded for term insurance products are accounted for as a reduction of premiums. 
 
 Reinsurance agreements that do not expose the Company to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk are recorded using the deposit method of accounting. The deposit assets on reinsurance are recorded within Other assets and the corresponding funds withheld liability for assets retained under these reinsurance agreements are recorded within Other liabilities . Balances associated with these agreements are included in the tables below. 
 
 "Change in value of market risk benefits, net of related hedging gain (loss)" include the impact of reinsurance agreements, particularly reinsurance agreements involving living benefit guarantees. The Company has entered into reinsurance agreements to transfer the risk related to the living benefit guarantees on variable annuities within the PLNJ business to Prudential Insurance. These reinsurance agreements are market risk benefits and have been accounted for in the same manner.

 Inflation Reduction Act. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Reduction Act ), (House of Representatives, 5376). One of the most significant provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act is a corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) based on the Company s GAAP income, with certain adjustments. This provision, which is applicable only to companies with average applicable financial statement income in excess of 1 billion for any three-year period ending in 2022 or later, is effective in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The impact of the book-income alternative minimum tax, if any, will vary from year to year based on the relationship of the Company s GAAP income to the Company s taxable income. Any tax paid pursuant to this provision is available as a tax credit in future years when the Company s tax rate exceeds the 15 minimum tax threshold. The Company is subject to CAMT for 2024 which may or may not result in a CAMT cash tax liability and will have no impact to the full year effective tax rate.

 On an ongoing basis, the Company and its regulators review its operations including, but not limited to, sales and other customer interface procedures and practices, and procedures for meeting obligations to its customers and other parties. These reviews may result in the modification or enhancement of processes or the imposition of other action plans, including concerning management oversight, sales and other customer interface procedures and practices, and the timing or computation of payments to customers and other parties. In certain cases, if appropriate, the Company may offer customers or other parties remediation and may incur charges, including the cost of such remediation, administrative costs and regulatory fines.

Overview 
 
 The Company sells variable annuities, indexed variable annuities, fixed annuities, universal life insurance, variable life insurance and term life insurance primarily through affiliated and unaffiliated distributors in the United States. 
 Effective January 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Somerset Reinsurance Ltd. ("Somerset Re") to coinsure a closed block of guaranteed universal life GUL policies to Prudential Universal Reinsurance Entity Company ("PURE"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America ("Prudential Insurance"), with retrocession by PURE of such liabilities on a modified coinsurance basis, to Somerset Re. This transaction is effective as of January 1, 2024, whereby, the Company recaptured all risks associated with the subject GUL policies from Prudential Arizona Reinsurance Universal Company ("PAR U"), Prudential Universal Reinsurance Company ("PURC") and Gibraltar Universal Life Reinsurance Company ("GUL Re") and subsequently established yearly renewable term ("YRT") reinsurance for the subject GUL business with Prudential Insurance. See Note 11 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 In August 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Wilton Re to reinsure certain guaranteed universal life policies. The transaction is structured on an indemnity coinsurance basis and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. 
 In May 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with AuguStar Life Insurance Company (formerly known as The Ohio National Life Insurance Company), an affiliate of Constellation Insurance Holdings, Inc., to reinsure approximately 10 billion of account values of Prudential Defined Income PDI traditional variable annuity contracts with guaranteed living and death benefits. The transaction was completed on June 30, 2023 with an effective date of April 1, 2023. See Note 11 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment 
 As a global financial services company, market interest rates are a key driver of our liquidity and capital positions, cash flows, results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates can affect these in several ways, including favorable or adverse impacts to: 
 investment-related activity, including: investment income returns, net investment spread results, 
 new money rates, mortgage loan prepayments and bond redemptions; 
 the valuation of fixed income investments and derivative instruments; 
 collateral posting requirements, hedging costs and other risk mitigation activities; 
 customer account values and assets under management, including their impacts on fee-related income; 
 insurance reserve levels, including market risk benefits ("MRBs"), and market experience true-ups; 
 policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity; and 
 product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix. 
 
 For additional information regarding interest rate risks, see Risk Factors Market Risk included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 Revenues and Expenses 
 
 The Company earns revenues principally from insurance premiums, mortality and expense fees, asset administration fees from insurance and investment products, and from net investment income on the investment of general account and other funds. The Company receives premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and annuity products. The Company earns mortality and expense fees, and asset administration fees, primarily from the sale and servicing of universal life insurance and separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities. The Company s operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided and reserves established for anticipated future insurance benefits, general business expenses, reinsurance premiums, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products sold and interest credited on general account liabilities. 

Accounting Policies Pronouncements 
 
 Application of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements. If management determines that modifications to assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, the Company s results of operations and financial position as reported in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements could change significantly. 
 
 Management believes the accounting policies relating to the following areas are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments: 
 
 Insurance liabilities; 
 Valuation of investments including derivatives, measurement of allowance for credit losses, and recognition of other-than-temporary impairments OTTI 
 Reinsurance recoverables; 
 Taxes on income; and 
 Reserves for contingencies, including reserves for losses in connection with unresolved legal matters 
 
 Market Performance - Equity and Interest Rate Assumptions 
 
 The liability for future policy benefits for certain of our universal life type products includes quarterly adjustments for the impact of changes to our estimate of future rates of returns on investments to reflect actual fund performance and market conditions. A portion of the returns on investments for our variable life contracts are dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. This rate of return influences the fees we earn and expected claims to be paid on variable life contracts, as well as other sources of profit. Returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances, which increase the future fees we expect to earn on variable life contracts and decrease expected claims to be paid on variable life contracts. The opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations. 
 
 The weighted average rate of return assumptions used in developing estimated market returns consider many factors specific to each product type, including asset durations, asset allocations and other factors. With regard to equity market assumptions, the near-term future rate of return assumption used in evaluating liabilities for future policy benefits for certain of our products, primarily our domestic variable life insurance products, is generally updated each quarter and is derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider historical equity returns and adjust projected equity returns over an initial future period of five years (the near-term so that equity returns converge to the long-term expected rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is greater than our near-term maximum future rate of return of 15.0 , we use our maximum future rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is lower than our near-term minimum future rate of return of 0 , we use our minimum future rate of return. As of September 30, 2024, our variable life insurance businesses assume an 8.0 long-term equity expected rate of return and a 2.7 near-term mean reversion equity expected rate of return.

Table of Contents 

 With regard to interest rate assumptions used in evaluating liabilities for future policy benefits for certain of our products, we generally update the long-term and near-term future rates used to project fixed income returns annually and quarterly, respectively. As a result of our 2024 annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, we increased our long-term expectation of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate by 25 basis points and now grade to a rate of 3.50 over ten years. As part of our quarterly market experience updates, we update our near-term projections of interest rates to reflect changes in current rates. 
 
 For further discussion of impacts that could result from changes in these key estimates and assumptions, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Application of Critical Accounting Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Changes in Financial Position 
 
 Total assets increased 22.3 billion from 213.3 billion at December 31, 2023 to 235.6 billion at September 30, 2024. Significant components were: 
 Total investments increased 10.8 billion driven by new sales of general account annuity products; 
 Reinsurance recoverables increased 4.6 billion primarily driven by the reinsurance of the Company's guaranteed universal life block to PURE; and 
 Separate account assets increased 3.6 billion primarily driven by favorable equity market performance, partially offset by net outflows. 
 Total liabilities increased 21.9 billion from 208.8 billion at December 31, 2023 to 230.7 billion at September 30, 2024. Significant components were: 
 Policyholders' account balances increased 12.7 billion primarily driven by incremental indexed product sales; 
 Other liabilities increased 4.5 billion primarily driven by the additional reinsurance of the Company's guaranteed universal life mortality risk ceded to Prudential Insurance and deferred gains associated with the reinsurance of the Company's guaranteed universal life block to PURE; and 
 Separate account liabilities increased 3.6 billion corresponding to the increase in separate account assets, as discussed above. 
 Total equity increased 0.4 primarily driven by 0.4 billion in unrealized gains on investments due to declining rates and changes to direct NPR spreads and net income of 0.3 billion, partially offset by 0.5 billion of returns of capital. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Income (loss) from Operations before Income Taxes 
 
 Three Months Comparison 
 
 Income (loss) from operations before income taxes increased 496 million from a net loss of 549 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to a net loss of 53 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by: 
 Higher Other income (loss) mainly due to trading gains in the current quarter compared to trading losses in the prior year quarter reflecting changes in interest rates; and 
 Higher Net investment income due to higher market rates and net business growth driven by incremental indexed product sales. 
 Partially offset by: 
 Higher Interest credited to policyholders account balances due to growth in variable indexed annuities.

 Risks and Risk Mitigants: 
 Fixed Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants . The primary risk exposure of these fixed annuity products relates to investment risks we bear for providing customers a minimum guaranteed interest rate or an index-linked interest rate required to be credited to the customer s account value, which include interest rate fluctuations and/or sustained periods of low interest rates, and credit risk related to the underlying investments. We manage these risk exposures primarily through our investment strategies and product design features, which include credit rate resetting subject to the minimum guaranteed interest rate, as well as surrender charges applied during the early years of the contract that help to provide protection for premature withdrawals. In addition, a portion of our fixed annuity products has a market value adjustment provision that affords protection of lapse in the case of rising interest rates. We also manage these risk exposures through external reinsurance for certain of our fixed annuity products.

Table of Contents 

 Indexed Variable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposure of these indexed variable annuity products relates to the investment risks we bear in order to credit to the customer s account balance the required crediting rate based on the performance of the elected indices at the end of each term. We manage this risk primarily through our investment strategies including derivatives and product design features, which include credit rate resetting subject to contractual minimums as well as surrender charges applied during the early years of the contract that help to provide protection for premature withdrawals. In addition, our indexed variable annuity strategies have an interim value provision that provides protection from lapse in the case of rising interest rates. 
 Variable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, along with actuarial assumptions such as contractholder mortality, the timing and amount of annuitization and withdrawals, and contract lapses. For these risk exposures, achievement of our expected returns is subject to the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. Prudential Financial manages our exposure to certain risks driven by fluctuations in capital markets primarily through a combination of i) Product Design Features, and ii) our Asset Liability Management Strategy ("ALM"), as discussed below. The Company also manages these risk exposures through external reinsurance for certain of our variable annuity products. For additional information regarding our external reinsurance agreements, see Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefit riders were discontinued as of December 31, 2020, and, in April 2022, the sale of a portion of our in force traditional variable annuity block was completed, as discussed in Note 1. 
 Product Design Features: 
 A portion of the variable annuity contracts that we offer include an asset transfer feature. This feature is implemented at the contract level, and transfers assets between certain variable investment sub-accounts selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond fund sub-account within the separate account. The objective of the asset transfer feature is to reduce our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. The asset transfer feature associated with highest daily living benefit products uses a designated bond fund sub-account within the separate account. The transfers are based on a static mathematical formula used with the particular benefit which considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of investment performance on the contractholder s total account value. Other product design features we utilize include, among others, asset allocation restrictions, minimum issuance age requirements and certain limitations on the amount of purchase payments, as well as a required minimum allocation to our general account for certain of our products. In addition, there is diversity in our fee arrangements, as certain fees are primarily based on the benefit guarantee amount, the contractholder account value and/or premiums, which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account values to decline. 
 Asset Liability Management Strategy (including fixed income instruments and derivatives): 
 We employ an ALM strategy that utilizes a combination of both traditional fixed income instruments and derivatives to meet expected liabilities associated with our annuity guarantees. The MRB liability that we hedge consists of expected living and death benefit claims under various market conditions, which are managed using fixed income instruments, derivatives, or a combination thereof. For our Prudential Defined Income variable annuity, we utilize fixed income instruments to meet expected liabilities. For the portion of our ALM strategy executed with derivatives, we enter into a range of exchange-traded and over-the-counter OTC equity, interest rate and credit derivatives, including, but not limited to: equity and treasury futures; total return, credit default and interest rate swaps; and options including equity options, swaptions, and floors and caps. The intent of this strategy is to more efficiently manage the capital and liquidity associated with these products while continuing to mitigate fluctuations in net income due to mo vements in capital markets. To achieve this, we periodically review and recalibrate the ALM strategy by optimizing the mix of derivatives and fixed income instruments to achieve expected outcomes. 
 
 Under our ALM strategy, we expect differences in the U.S. GAAP net income impact between the changes in value of the fixed income instruments (either designated as available-for-sale or designated as trading) and derivatives as compared to the changes in the MRB liability these assets support. These differences can be primarily attribut ed to two distinct areas: 
 
 Different accounting treatment between liabilities and assets supporting those liabilities. Under U.S. GAAP, changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments and fixed income instruments designated as trading, and MRB, excluding the changes in the Company s NPR spreads, are immediately reflected in net income, while changes in the fair value of fixed income instruments that are designated as available-for-sale are recorded as unrealized gains (losses) in other comprehensive income. 

83 

Table of Contents 

 General hedge results. For the derivative portion of the ALM strategy, the net hedging impact (the extent to which the changes in value of the hedging instruments offset the change in value of the portion of the MRB we are hedging) may be impacted by a number of factors, including: cash flow timing differences between our hedging instruments and the corresponding portion of the MRB we are hedging, basis differences attributable to actual underlying contractholder funds to be hedged versus hedgeable indices, rebalancing costs related to dynamic rebalancing of hedging instruments as markets move, certain elements of the MRB that may not be hedged (including certain actuarial assumptions), and implied and realized market volatility on the hedge positions relative to the portion of the MRB we seek to hedge.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the Company. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of our business, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our business, general economic conditions, our ability to borrow from affiliates and our access to the capital markets through affiliates as described herein . 
 Effective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the organization. Management monitors the liquidity of the Company on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon. We use a Risk Appetite Framework ("RAF") to ensure that all risks taken by the Company align with our capacity and willingness to take those risks. The RAF provides a dynamic assessment of capital and liquidity stress impacts, including scenarios similar to, and more severe than, those occurring due to COVID-19, and is intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available to absorb those impacts. We believe that our capital and liquidity resources are sufficient to satisfy the capital and liquidity requirements of the Company. 
 Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by domestic and international regulators. These regulations currently include requirements (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making) relating to capital and liquidity management. For information on these regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on us, see Business Regulation" and Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Capital 
 We manage the Company to regulatory capital levels consistent with our "AA" ratings targets. We utilize the risk-based capital RBC ratio as a primary measure of capital adequacy. RBC is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with the practices of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). RBC considers, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer s products and liabilities, interest rate risks, and general business risks. RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring an insurer s solvency and ability to pay future claims. The reporting of RBC measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities, but is available to the public. The Company s capital levels substantially exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations. Our regulatory capital levels may be affected in the future by changes to the applicable regulations, proposals for which are currently under consideration by both domestic and international insurance regulators. 
 The regulatory capital level of the Company can be materially impacted by interest rate and equity market fluctuations, changes in the values of derivatives, the level of impairments recorded, and credit quality migration of the investment portfolio, among other items. In addition, the reinsurance of business or the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by, or credit quality migration affecting, the reinsurers or for other reasons could negatively impact regulatory capital levels. The Company s regulatory capital level is also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator.

 Liquidity 
 Our liquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, as described more fully below, including portfolios of liquid assets. Our investment portfolios are integral to the overall liquidity of the Company. We use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet projected cash outflows, including claims. The impact of Prudential Funding, LLC s ("Prudential Funding"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, financing capacity on liquidity (as described below) is considered in the internal liquidity measures of the Company. 
 Liquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (for example, type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our liquidity under various stress scenarios, including company-specific and market-wide events. We continue to believe that cash generated by ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. 
 The principal sources of the Company s liquidity are premiums and certain annuity considerations, investment and fee income, investment maturities, sales of investments and internal borrowings. The principal uses of that liquidity include benefits, claims, and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Other uses of liquidity include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, the payment of dividends and returns of capital to the parent company, hedging and reinsurance activity and payments in connection with financing activities. 
 In managing liquidity, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. We use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers. 
 Liquid Assets 
 Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, U.S. Treasury fixed maturities, and fixed maturities that are not designated as held-to-maturity and public equity securities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had liquid assets of 42.9 billion and 32.3 billion, respectively. The portion of liquid assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was 3.9 billion and 2.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, 32.2 billion, or 92 , of the fixed maturity investments in the Company's general account portfolios, were rated high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating. 
 Prudential Funding, LLC 
 Prudential Financial and Prudential Funding borrow funds in the capital markets primarily through the direct issuance of commercial paper. The borrowings serve as an additional source of financing to meet our working capital needs. Prudential Funding operates under a support agreement with Prudential Insurance whereby Prudential Insurance has agreed to maintain Prudential Funding s positive tangible net worth at all times. 
 Hedging activities associated with Annuities 
 For the portion of the risk management strategy executed through hedging, we enter into a range of exchange-traded, cleared and other OTC equity and interest rate derivatives in order to hedge certain capital market risks related to more severe market conditions. This portion of our ALM strategy requires access to liquidity to meet payment obligations relating to these derivatives, such as payments for periodic settlements, purchases, maturities and terminations. These liquidity needs can vary materially due to, among other items, changes in interest rates, equity markets, mortality and policyholder behavior. 
 
 The hedging portion of our ALM strategy may also result in derivative-related collateral postings to (when we are in a net pay position) or from (when we are in a net receive position) counterparties. The net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the exposures hedged. Depending on market conditions, the collateral posting requirements can result in material liquidity needs when we are in a net post position. 
 
 Term and Universal Life Reserve Financing 
 The Company uses captive reinsurance subsidiaries to finance the portion of the statutory reserves required to be held under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX that is considered to be non-economic. The financing arrangements involve the reinsurance of term and universal life business to our affiliated captive reinsurers and the issuance of surplus notes by those affiliated captives that are treated as capital for statutory purposes. These surplus notes are subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of principal and interest on the surplus notes can only be made with prior insurance regulatory approval. 

85 

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024 the affiliated captive reinsurance companies have entered into agreements with external counterparties providing for the issuance of up to an aggregate of 11,250 million of surplus notes by our affiliated captive reinsurers in return for the receipt of credit-linked notes Credit-Linked Note Structures ), of which 8,780 million of surplus notes was outstanding, as compared to an aggregate issuance capacity of 15,700 million, of which 13,820 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Under the agreements, the affiliated captive receives in exchange for the surplus notes one or more credit-linked notes issued by a special-purpose affiliate of the Company with an aggregate principal amount equal to the surplus notes outstanding. The affiliated captive holds the credit-linked notes as assets supporting Regulation XXX or Guideline AXXX non-economic reserves, as applicable. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our affiliated captive reinsurance companies had outstanding an aggregate of 2,600 million of debt issued for the purpose of financing Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX non-economic reserves, of which approximately 700 million relates to Regulation XXX reserves and approximately 1,900 million relates to Guideline AXXX reserves. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, for purposes of financing Guideline AXXX reserves, one of our affiliated captives had approximately 3,982 million of surplus notes outstanding that were issued to affiliates. 
 
 The Company has introduced updated versions of its individual life products in conjunction with the requirement to adopt principle-based reserving by January 1, 2020. These updated products are currently priced to support the principle-based statutory reserve level without the need for reserve financing. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 In order to ensure that the information we must disclose in our filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis, the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act Rule 15d-15(e), as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the identification of the material weakness, as reported in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 16, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based on this definition, management has concluded that the material weakness reported previously continued to exist in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 As previously reported, the Company did not design and maintain effective controls over the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of the review of the manual calculations and related adjustments for the Policyholder Account Balance liability for variable annuity products. This material weakness continued to exist as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Remediation Status of Reported Material Weakness 
 
 Management has taken steps to remediate the material weakness including (i) updating the valuation model to substantially reduce the need for the manual adjustment and (ii) reviewing the end-to-end process with respect to manual calculations and related adjustments with enhancements to communication, documentation and review thresholds. The material weakness cannot be considered remediated until after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 As described above under Remediation Status of Reported Material Weakness, there were changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 15d-15(f), occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
