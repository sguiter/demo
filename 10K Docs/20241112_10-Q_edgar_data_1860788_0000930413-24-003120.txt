of net assets that accrues daily and pays monthly. Effective for the period from July 23, 2024
through July 22, 2025, the Sponsor has agreed to waive the entire Sponsor Fee for the first billion of the Trust s net assets.
If the Trust s net assets exceed 1.5 billion prior to July 22, 2025, the Sponsor Fee charged on net assets over 1.5 billion will
be 0.20 of net assets. All investors will incur the same Sponsor Fee which is the weighted average of those fee rates. After July
22, 2025, the Sponsor Fee will be 0.20 of net assets. The Sponsor has agreed to pay all operating expenses (except for litigation
expenses and other extraordinary expenses) from the Sponsor Fee. The Sponsor from time to time will sell ETH, which may be facilitated
by one or more liquidity providers and/or the ETH Custodian, in such quantity as is necessary to permit payment of the Sponsor
Fee and Trust expenses and liabilities not assumed by the Sponsor. 

The Trustee fee is paid by the Sponsor and is
not a separate expense of the Trust. 

The Trust holds its ETH at the ETH Custodian
and may also hold ETH at the Additional ETH Custodian, both of which are a regulated third-party custodians that carry insurance
(in the case of the Additional ETH Custodian, such insurance is carried by its parent, Coinbase Inc., and is intended to cover
the loss of client assets held by Coinbase Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the Additional ETH Custodian) and are responsible
for safekeeping of ETH owned by the Trust and holding private keys that provide access to the ETH in the Trust s ETH account. 

State Street Bank and Trust Company serves as
the Trust s administrator, transfer agent and cash custodian. 

of net assets. 

VanEck is a minority interest holder in the
parent company of the ETH Custodian, representing less than of its equity. 

Shares to authorized participants. Authorized participants pay a transaction fee for each order
they place to create or redeem one or more baskets. The Administrator calculates the cost to purchase (or sell in the case of a
redemption order) the amount of ETH represented by the baskets being created (or redeemed); the amount of ETH represented is equal
to the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the baskets being created (or redeemed). 

The Trust creates and redeems Shares, but only
in one or more baskets. Baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount
of ETH represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is equal to the combined NAV of the number of
Shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined as of 4:00 p.m. EST on the day the order to create or redeem
baskets is properly received. For an order to create baskets, an authorized participant will deliver cash to the Trust s account
at the cash custodian, which the Sponsor will then use to purchase ETH from a liquidity provider chosen by the Sponsor. For an

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

This information should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes to financial statements included with this report. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements
that relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, such forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such
as may, will, should, could, expect, plan, anticipate, 
 believe, estimate, predict, potential or the negative of these terms or other
comparable terminology. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) included in this report that address activities, events
or developments that may occur in the future, including such matters as changes in commodity prices and market conditions (for ETH and
the Shares), the operations of the Trust, the plans of the Sponsor and references to the Trust s future success and other similar
matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These statements
are based upon certain assumptions and analyses made by the Sponsor on the basis of its perception of historical trends, current conditions
and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results
and developments will conform to the Sponsor s expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including
the special considerations discussed in this report, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or regulations,
including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments.
Consequently, all the forward-looking statements made in this report are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no
assurance that the actual results or developments the Sponsor anticipates will be realized or, even if substantially realized, will result
in the expected consequences to, or have the expected effects on, the Trust s operations or the value of the Shares issued by the
Trust. Moreover, neither the Sponsor nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the forward-looking
statements. Neither the Trust nor the Sponsor undertakes an obligation to publicly update or conform to actual results any forward-looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. 

Introduction 

The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust. The Trust does not have directors,
officers or employees. The creation and operation of the Trust has been arranged by the Sponsor. The Trust is administered by the Trust
Agreement, among the Sponsor, the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee. The Trust is managed and controlled by the Sponsor, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of VanEck. The Sponsor is not governed by a board of directors. 

The Trust s investment objective is to reflect the performance
of the price of ETH less the operating expenses of the Trust. The Trust is a passive investment vehicle that does not seek to pursue any
investment strategy beyond tracking the price of ETH. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or
ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of ETH. 

The Trust issues and redeems Shares only in aggregations of 25,000
Shares, a Basket, or integral multiples thereof, and only in transactions with authorized participants. 

Shares of the Trust trade on the Exchange under the ticker symbol ETHV. 

Computation of Net Asset Value 

The Trust s NAV is calculated based on the Trust s net
asset holdings as reconciled to the ETH Custodians accounts on a market approach, determined on a daily basis in accordance with
the MarketVector TM Ethereum Benchmark Rate price at 4:00 p.m. EST. The Trust s NAV per Share is calculated by taking
the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities, and then dividing that total by the total number of outstanding
Shares. The Trust Agreement gives the Sponsor the exclusive authority to determine the Trust s NAV and the Trust s NAV per
Share, which it has delegated to the Administrator. 

Liquidity 

The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events
that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for a fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume
most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report
was the Sponsor s Fee. The Trust s only source of liquidity is its sales of ETH. 

10 

Significant Accounting Policies 

In preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management
makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amount of revenue and expenses reported during the period. Actual results
could differ from these estimates. A description of the valuation of ETH, a critical accounting policy that the Trust believes is important
to understanding its results of operations and financial position, is provided in the section entitled Computation of Net Asset
Value above. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements included in this report for further discussion of
the Trust s accounting policies. 

Results of Operations 

The Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 

The Trust s NAV increased from 10,234,617 at June 30, 2024 to
 63,824,094 at September 30, 2024, a 524 increase. The increase in the Trust s net asset value resulted primarily from the number
of shares outstanding increasing from 200,000 Shares at June 30, 2024 to 1,675,000 Shares at September 30, 2024, a net result of 1,725,000
Shares (69 Baskets) being created and 250,000 Shares (10 Baskets) being redeemed during the period, partially offset by a decrease in
the price of ETH, which contracted 26 from 3,494 at June 30, 2024 to 2,602 at September 30, 2024. 

The 26 decrease in the NAV per Share from 51.17 at June 30, 2024
to 38.10 at September 30, 2024 is directly related to the 26 decrease in the price of ETH during this period. 

The NAV per Share of 51.63 on July 19, 2024, was the highest during
the quarter, compared with a low during the quarter of 32.59 on September 6, 2024. 

Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter
ended September 30, 2024, was 12,653,618 resulting from a net unrealized depreciation on investment in ether of 10,815,249, a net realized
loss of 1,838,369 on ETH sold for the redemption of Shares and a net investment income of 0. The Trust had no expenses during the quarter
as they were all waived by the Sponsor. 

The Period May 20, 2024 (date of Seeding) to September 30, 2024 

The Trust s NAV increased from 100,000 at May 20, 2024 (date
of Seeding) to 63,824,094 at September 30, 2024, a 63,724 increase. The increase in the Trust s NAV resulted primarily from an
increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which increased from 2,000 Shares at May 20, 2024 to 1,675,000 Shares at September 30, 2024,
a net result of 2,000 Seed Shares and 1,925,000 Shares (77 Baskets) being created and 2,000 Seed Shares and 250,000 Shares (10 Baskets)
being redeemed during the period, partially offset by a decrease in the price of ETH, which contracted approximately 24 from 3,414 at
June 25, 2024 (date of initial ether investment) to 2,602 at September 30, 2024. 

The 24 decrease in the NAV per Share from 50.00 at May 20, 2024 to
 38.10 at September 30, 2024 is directly related to the 24 decrease in the price of ETH during this period. 

The NAV per Share of 51.63 on July 19, 2024, was the highest during
the period, compared with a low during the period of 32.59 on September 6, 2024. 

Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the period
ended September 30, 2024, was 12,419,001 resulting from a net unrealized depreciation on investment in ETH of 10,580,632, a net realized
loss of 1,838,369 on ether sold for the redemption of Shares and a net investment income of 0. The Trust had no expenses during the
period as they were all waived by the Sponsor. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

The duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent
to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, with
the participation of the Trustee, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded
that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and
forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those
a principal executive officer and 

11 

principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of
disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.
